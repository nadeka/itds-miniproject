L3778	u55	m3	FLOYD	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
L3777	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3771	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
L3770	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3757	u55	m3	FLOYD	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
L3756	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3750	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
L3749	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3729	u55	m3	FLOYD	She's wonderful.
L3728	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3721	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
L3720	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3713	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
L3712	u49	m3	B20	SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
L4300	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Roger.
L4299	u60	m3	POOLE	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
L4298	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess not.
L4297	u60	m3	POOLE	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
L4296	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
L4283	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
L4282	u60	m3	POOLE	It's the last one.
L4209	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L4208	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal?
L4199	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4198	u60	m3	POOLE	Two more.
L4197	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4196	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
L4193	u60	m3	POOLE	No.
L4192	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You're kidding.
L4191	u60	m3	POOLE	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4190	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4189	u60	m3	POOLE	Are you reasonably awake?
L4188	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Good morning. How's it going?
L4163	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4162	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4161	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4160	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
L4159	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, that's something.
L4017	u60	m3	POOLE	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4016	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess it isn't.
L4015	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4014	u50	m3	BOWMAN	But not completely inconceivable?
L4013	u60	m3	POOLE	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4012	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4011	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
L4001	u60	m3	POOLE	That's true.
L4000	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3999	u60	m3	POOLE	How?
L3998	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3997	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I thought so.
L3996	u50	m3	BOWMAN	That seems very unlikely.
L3995	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
L3992	u60	m3	POOLE	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3991	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
L3990	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3989	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh?
L3988	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
L3987	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose the idea was specialized training.
L3984	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No. I never did, either.
L3983	u60	m3	POOLE	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3982	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3981	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3980	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It's possible.
L3979	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
L3976	u60	m3	POOLE	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
L3975	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L3974	u60	m3	POOLE	Really.
L3973	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
L3972	u60	m3	POOLE	That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
L3969	u60	m3	POOLE	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3968	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes?
L3967	u60	m3	POOLE	It's about my salary cheques.
L3966	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What's up?
L3965	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
L3964	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Sure, what is it?
L3963	u60	m3	POOLE	Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
L3945	u60	m3	POOLE	Okay, come on down.
L3944	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay. 
L3943	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Just a sec.
L3942	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
L4368	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4367	u56	m3	HAL	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4366	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I am prepared to do that anyway.
L4363	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4362	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4361	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4360	u56	m3	HAL	I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
L4357	u56	m3	HAL	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4356	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
L4355	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4354	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
L4353	u56	m3	HAL	If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
L4350	u56	m3	HAL	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4349	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
L4348	u56	m3	HAL	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4347	u50	m3	BOWMAN	The antenna has to be replaced.
L4346	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
L4335	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4334	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is.
L4333	u56	m3	HAL	Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
L4271	u56	m3	HAL	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4270	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is, Hal.
L4269	u56	m3	HAL	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4268	u50	m3	BOWMAN	And don't you worry about it.
L4267	u56	m3	HAL	Well, don't worry about it.
L4266	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
L4265	u56	m3	HAL	Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
L4230	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4229	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L4228	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4227	u56	m3	HAL	I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L4224	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4223	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4222	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know.
L4221	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4220	u56	m3	HAL	Sure, Dave, what's up?
L4219	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
L4080	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
L4079	u56	m3	HAL	The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
L4070	u56	m3	HAL	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4069	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What is it, Hal?
L4068	u56	m3	HAL	Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
L4007	u50	m3	BOWMAN	He's got a point.
L4006	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
L4019	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
L4018	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4010	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
L4009	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4003	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
L4002	u51	m3	C12	CONINUED
L3994	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, what is it?
L3993	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3978	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Did they have any explanation for this?
L3977	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3971	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
L3970	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3693	u52	m3	CHILD	Goodbye, Daddy.
L3692	u55	m3	FLOYD	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
L3691	u52	m3	CHILD	Yes, Daddy.
L3690	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
L3689	u52	m3	CHILD	Thank you, Daddy.
L3688	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
L3685	u55	m3	FLOYD	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
L3684	u52	m3	CHILD	How many days until you come home?
L3683	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
L3682	u52	m3	CHILD	She's in the bathroom.
L3681	u55	m3	FLOYD	Where is Mrs. Brown?
L3680	u52	m3	CHILD	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
L3679	u55	m3	FLOYD	One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
L3677	u55	m3	FLOYD	In three days, darling, I hope.
L3676	u52	m3	CHILD	When are you coming home?
L3675	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
L3674	u52	m3	CHILD	Are you coming to my party?
L3673	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
L3672	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm having a party tomorrow.
L3669	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
L3668	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
L3810	u59	m3	PILOT	I'll bet it's a fortune.
L3809	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
L3808	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
L3807	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
L3806	u59	m3	PILOT	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
L3805	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
L3799	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, how's it going back there?
L3798	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Thank you.
L3797	u59	m3	PILOT	Oh, thank you very much.
L3780	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
L3779	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
L3776	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
L3775	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
L3774	u54	m3	ELENA	Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
L3759	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, that does sound very odd.
L3758	u54	m3	ELENA	Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
L3735	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, where are all of you off to?
L3734	u54	m3	ELENA	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
L3733	u55	m3	FLOYD	How is gregor?
L3732	u54	m3	ELENA	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
L3731	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
L3730	u54	m3	ELENA	And your charming little daughter?
L3653	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, it's coming along very well.
L3652	u58	m3	MILLER	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
L3651	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I think so. Just about then.
L3631	u55	m3	FLOYD	Fine.
L3630	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
L3629	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, very pleasant.
L3628	u58	m3	MILLER	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
L3627	u55	m3	FLOYD	Please, it really doesn't matter.
L3626	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
L3623	u58	m3	MILLER	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
L3622	u55	m3	FLOYD	How do you do, Mr. Miller?
L3773	u55	m3	FLOYD	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
L3772	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
L3768	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
L3767	u55	m3	FLOYD	Certainly.
L3766	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
L3763	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I'm glad about that.
L3762	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Fortunately, they did.
L3761	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
L3760	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
L3754	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3753	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	That's right.
L3752	u55	m3	FLOYD	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3751	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
L3748	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3747	u55	m3	FLOYD	Really?
L3746	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3745	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
L3740	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
L3739	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
L3738	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
L3726	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, really, thank you very much.
L3725	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you quite sure?
L3724	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
L3907	u57	m3	MICHAELS	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
L3906	u55	m3	FLOYD	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3905	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3904	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any ideas about the colour?
L3897	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
L3896	u55	m3	FLOYD	But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
L3893	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3892	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any clue as to what it is?
L3891	u57	m3	MICHAELS	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3890	u55	m3	FLOYD	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3889	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
L3869	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3868	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
L3839	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3838	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
L3837	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
L3834	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3833	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3832	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
L3829	u59	m3	PILOT	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3828	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3827	u59	m3	PILOT	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3826	u55	m3	FLOYD	What do you mean?
L3825	u59	m3	PILOT	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3824	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you.
L3821	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3820	u59	m3	PILOT	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3819	u55	m3	FLOYD	When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3818	u59	m3	PILOT	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L3817	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
L4183	u60	m3	POOLE	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
L4182	u56	m3	HAL	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
L4181	u60	m3	POOLE	Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
L4175	u60	m3	POOLE	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
L4174	u56	m3	HAL	I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
L4170	u56	m3	HAL	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
L4169	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, Hal, what's up?
L4119	u60	m3	POOLE	Opening pod bay doors.
L4118	u56	m3	HAL	Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
L4113	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
L4112	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4111	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
L4110	u56	m3	HAL	I understand.
L4109	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
L4108	u56	m3	HAL	Five by five, Frank.
L4097	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4096	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
L4033	u60	m3	POOLE	Thank you very much, Hal.
L4032	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4031	u60	m3	POOLE	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
L4030	u56	m3	HAL	That's true
L4029	u60	m3	POOLE	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
L4028	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4025	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4024	u60	m3	POOLE	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
L4023	u56	m3	HAL	True.
L4022	u60	m3	POOLE	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
L4021	u56	m3	HAL	I will if I can, Frank.
L4020	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
L5890	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
L5889	u85	m5	LEELOO	Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
L5876	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
L5875	u85	m5	LEELOO	Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
L5693	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You know exactly where they are!
L5692	u85	m5	LEELOO	Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
L5680	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The case was stolen?
L5679	u85	m5	LEELOO	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
L5678	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The case..with the stones... Where is it?
L5674	u85	m5	LEELOO	Napoleon... small.
L5673	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What're you laughing about?
L5645	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	At your service.
L5644	u85	m5	LEELOO	Corn-i-Lius?
L5643	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
L5761	u99	m5	ZORG	I know...
L5760	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You are a monster, Zorg!
L5756	u99	m5	ZORG	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
L5755	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
L5754	u99	m5	ZORG	Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
L5752	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	They are robots!
L5751	u99	m5	ZORG	...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
L5748	u99	m5	ZORG	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
L5747	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	No thank you.
L5746	u99	m5	ZORG	...would you like a drink?
L5745	u99	m5	ZORG	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
L5744	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
L5743	u99	m5	ZORG	Why?  What's wrong with me?
L5742	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
L5741	u99	m5	ZORG	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
L5740	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
L5739	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
L5738	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
L5737	u99	m5	ZORG	Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
L5711	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm fucked!
L5710	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...We're saved!
L6266	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	That's what I'm saying.
L6265	u84	m5	KORBEN	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
L6264	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
L6263	u84	m5	KORBEN	There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
L6259	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
L6258	u84	m5	KORBEN	Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
L6172	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
L6171	u84	m5	KORBEN	When is she not in trouble?
L6170	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Leeloo's in trouble?
L6169	u84	m5	KORBEN	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
L6168	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
L5840	u84	m5	KORBEN	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
L5839	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What are you doing?
L5833	u84	m5	KORBEN	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
L5832	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Of course.
L5831	u84	m5	KORBEN	Good luck..
L5830	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We have to save the world.
L5829	u84	m5	KORBEN	What kind of mission?
L5828	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
L5827	u84	m5	KORBEN	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
L5826	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
L5658	u84	m5	KORBEN	That's what I thought.
L5657	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
L5656	u84	m5	KORBEN	Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
L5655	u84	m5	KORBEN	I know. I was there when she arrived.
L5654	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
L5653	u84	m5	KORBEN	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
L5652	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
L5651	u84	m5	KORBEN	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
L5650	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
L5649	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	She's an exception..
L5648	u84	m5	KORBEN	They all like this in your family, father?
L5628	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
L5627	u84	m5	KORBEN	So you do know her.
L5626	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
L5625	u84	m5	KORBEN	You noticed...
L5624	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	He's a she!
L5622	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The girl?
L5621	u84	m5	KORBEN	I brought the girl remember?
L5620	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Who are you?
L5617	u84	m5	KORBEN	She dropped in on me... holding this.
L5616	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
L5615	u84	m5	KORBEN	She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
L5614	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
L5613	u84	m5	KORBEN	Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
L5557	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
L5556	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What are we going to do?
L5522	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Thank you, Mr. President.
L5521	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
L5516	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
L5515	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
L5512	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes..thank God..
L5511	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Is there anything that can stop it?
L5510	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
L5509	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	And then?
L5508	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
L5470	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
L5469	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
L5468	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
L5464	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	One more reason to shoot first eh?
L5463	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
L6252	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
L6251	u79	m5	DAVID	You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
L5913	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
L5912	u79	m5	DAVID	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
L5911	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Where's Leeloo?
L5731	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
L5730	u79	m5	DAVID	I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
L5689	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Perfect.
L5688	u79	m5	DAVID	They really made her...
L5687	u79	m5	DAVID	I didn't know your size.
L5686	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
L5676	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes. Of course..
L5675	u79	m5	DAVID	Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
L5672	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
L5671	u79	m5	DAVID	What's she doing?
L5647	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
L5646	u79	m5	DAVID	Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
L5637	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
L5636	u79	m5	DAVID	Father, will you please explain what's going on?
L5632	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
L5631	u79	m5	DAVID	What is?
L5630	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	It's a miracle!!!
L6124	u80	m5	DIVA	They are... with me...
L6123	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
L6120	u80	m5	DIVA	I would like to have died in peace...
L6119	u84	m5	KORBEN	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
L6118	u80	m5	DIVA	I don't have time... I need to know.
L6117	u84	m5	KORBEN	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
L6116	u80	m5	DIVA	Do you love her?
L6115	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
L6114	u80	m5	DIVA	She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
L6110	u84	m5	KORBEN	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
L6109	u80	m5	DIVA	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
L6108	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo... is... she's...
L6107	u80	m5	DIVA	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
L6106	u84	m5	KORBEN	Who?
L6105	u80	m5	DIVA	You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
L5670	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo..
L5669	u81	m5	FINGER	Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
L5668	u84	m5	KORBEN	"5'7"", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.."
L5667	u81	m5	FINGER	So, just how big was this fare?
L5666	u84	m5	KORBEN	Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
L5665	u81	m5	FINGER	Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

L5494	u81	m5	FINGER	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
L5493	u84	m5	KORBEN	At least, the cat comes back.

L5491	u84	m5	KORBEN	I was talking to the cat.

L5426	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	When EVIL returns so shall we.
L5425	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	Time is of no importance, only life is important.
L5424	u92	m5	PRIEST	Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
L5423	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
L5422	u92	m5	PRIEST	Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
L5421	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	Take them and put them in a safe place.

L5791	u84	m5	KORBEN	Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
L5790	u88	m5	MOTHER	You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
L5789	u84	m5	KORBEN	All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
L5788	u88	m5	MOTHER	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
L5787	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?

L5816	u90	m5	MUNRO	What is it?

L5812	u90	m5	MUNRO	Why not?
L5811	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm not going.
L5810	u90	m5	MUNRO	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
L5809	u84	m5	KORBEN	You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
L5806	u90	m5	MUNRO	You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
L5805	u84	m5	KORBEN	I've had enough good news for today

L5801	u90	m5	MUNRO	Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
L5800	u90	m5	MUNRO	Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
L5799	u84	m5	KORBEN	Just one... why me?
L5798	u90	m5	MUNRO	You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
L5797	u84	m5	KORBEN	Where have I heard this song before?
L5796	u90	m5	MUNRO	To save the world.
L5795	u84	m5	KORBEN	What mission?
L5794	u90	m5	MUNRO	Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
L6309	u84	m5	KORBEN	I love you...
L6308	u85	m5	LEELOO	Tell me...
L6305	u84	m5	KORBEN	Because...
L6304	u85	m5	LEELOO	Why?... Why would you need me?
L6303	u84	m5	KORBEN	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
L6302	u85	m5	LEELOO	I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
L6301	u85	m5	LEELOO	But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
L6300	u84	m5	KORBEN	Exactly.
L6299	u85	m5	LEELOO	...Like love...
L6298	u84	m5	KORBEN	You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
L6297	u85	m5	LEELOO	What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
L6293	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
L6292	u85	m5	LEELOO	I want to sleep... forever...

L6269	u84	m5	KORBEN	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
L6268	u85	m5	LEELOO	The wind blows... the fire burns...
L6267	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
L6241	u85	m5	LEELOO	Protect life... Until death.
L6240	u84	m5	KORBEN	I told you not to read all that crap!
L6239	u85	m5	LEELOO	Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
L6238	u84	m5	KORBEN	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
L6237	u85	m5	LEELOO	I'm so very sad.
L6067	u84	m5	KORBEN	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
L6066	u85	m5	LEELOO	You're nothing but a... a...
L6064	u84	m5	KORBEN	It's difficult.
L6063	u85	m5	LEELOO	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
L6062	u84	m5	KORBEN	I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
L6059	u84	m5	KORBEN	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
L6058	u85	m5	LEELOO	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
L6057	u84	m5	KORBEN	Where you going?
L6056	u85	m5	LEELOO	OK, you can turn around!
L6055	u84	m5	KORBEN	You noticed..
L6054	u85	m5	LEELOO	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
L6053	u84	m5	KORBEN	You get that off the screen?
L6052	u85	m5	LEELOO	You know women normally change five times more than men.
L6051	u84	m5	KORBEN	Here we go again...
L5965	u85	m5	LEELOO	...Hoppi-hoppa.
L5964	u84	m5	KORBEN	Uh...
L5963	u85	m5	LEELOO	"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?"
L5962	u84	m5	KORBEN	Apipoussan?
L5961	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoussan!
L5960	u84	m5	KORBEN	"I know how to say ""Hello"". Teach me how to say ""Good-bye"", that's all I need."
L5959	u85	m5	LEELOO	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
L5958	u84	m5	KORBEN	You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
L5957	u85	m5	LEELOO	All 900.
L5956	u84	m5	KORBEN	Which one?
L5955	u85	m5	LEELOO	Learning language.
L5954	u84	m5	KORBEN	Finished what?
L5950	u85	m5	LEELOO	What is... Make Love?
L5949	u84	m5	KORBEN	Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
L5947	u84	m5	KORBEN	"Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!"
L5946	u85	m5	LEELOO	Love...
L5944	u84	m5	KORBEN	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
L5943	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
L5901	u84	m5	KORBEN	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
L5900	u85	m5	LEELOO	Dinoine chagantakat!
L5871	u84	m5	KORBEN	Oh god!
L5870	u85	m5	LEELOO	Cornelius..
L5869	u84	m5	KORBEN	You hear that?
L5859	u84	m5	KORBEN	Uh..you're welcome.
L5858	u85	m5	LEELOO	Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
L5825	u84	m5	KORBEN	"I suppose that means ""Hi"" ?"
L5824	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
L5729	u97	m5	THAI	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
L5728	u84	m5	KORBEN	At least I won lunch.
L5726	u97	m5	THAI	"You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: ""It never rain every day."" This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!"
L5725	u84	m5	KORBEN	The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
L5724	u97	m5	THAI	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
L5723	u84	m5	KORBEN	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
L5722	u97	m5	THAI	Not going to open?
L5540	u84	m5	KORBEN	You're welcome..
L5539	u89	m5	MUGGER	Thanks..
L5538	u84	m5	KORBEN	You gotta push the little yellow button...
L5537	u89	m5	MUGGER	It's not?
L5536	u84	m5	KORBEN	You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
L5535	u89	m5	MUGGER	Uh..
L5534	u84	m5	KORBEN	Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
L5533	u89	m5	MUGGER	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
L5532	u84	m5	KORBEN	Been here long?
L5531	u89	m5	MUGGER	The cash man!
L6314	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
L6313	u90	m5	MUNRO	Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
L5586	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	An elephant couldn't crack it.
L5585	u90	m5	MUNRO	This thing solid?
L5574	u90	m5	MUNRO	Wonderful!
L5573	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
L5570	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
L5569	u90	m5	MUNRO	Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
L5568	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
L5567	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
L5566	u90	m5	MUNRO	Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
L5565	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
L5564	u90	m5	MUNRO	Talk English Doc.
L5563	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
L5562	u90	m5	MUNRO	Have you identified it?
L5561	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	Actually only one cell survived..
L5560	u90	m5	MUNRO	This is all that survived?
L6255	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	How much time is left?
L6254	u90	m5	MUNRO	They just landed in the desert.
L5774	u90	m5	MUNRO	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
L5773	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	I want your best man on this!
L5770	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	...What do you mean?
L5769	u90	m5	MUNRO	The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
L5768	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
L5767	u90	m5	MUNRO	I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
L5480	u96	m5	STAEDERT	I'm about to, Mr. President.
L5479	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
L5453	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Gentlemen?
L5452	u96	m5	STAEDERT	My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
L5451	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Recommendations.
L5450	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Wait or act.
L5449	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Options.
L5448	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
L5447	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
L5446	u96	m5	STAEDERT	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
L5445	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
L5444	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Perfect, Mr. President.
L5443	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Is that better?
L5442	u96	m5	STAEDERT	I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
L5441	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Staedert, do you read me?
L5407	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	To fame.. salud..
L5406	u92	m5	PRIEST	Drink!
L5405	u92	m5	PRIEST	Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
L5404	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
L5400	u92	m5	PRIEST	Only too well... here you must be parched..
L5399	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
L5398	u92	m5	PRIEST	Amen..
L5397	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..
L5396	u92	m5	PRIEST	Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
L6225	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm not at the hotel!
L6224	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
L6223	u99	m5	ZORG	Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
L6222	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Yes, Sir!
L6221	u99	m5	ZORG	Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
L6220	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
L6219	u99	m5	ZORG	How's that? Can you hear me better now?
L6012	u95	m5	SHADOW	...I can't wait to be among you.
L6011	u99	m5	ZORG	The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
L6009	u99	m5	ZORG	Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
L6008	u95	m5	SHADOW	How's our deal coming along?
L6007	u99	m5	ZORG	Got it.
L6006	u95	m5	SHADOW	Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
L6005	u99	m5	ZORG	Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
L6004	u95	m5	SHADOW	...Not far, now.
L6003	u99	m5	ZORG	No... not at all.  Where are you?
L6002	u95	m5	SHADOW	Am I disturbing you?
L55857	u135	m9	REEF	And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
L55856	u131	m9	CARL	I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
L55855	u135	m9	REEF	I don't know.
L55854	u131	m9	CARL	But if they <u>do</u>?
L55853	u135	m9	REEF	Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
L55852	u131	m9	CARL	Which is the one - we have to worry about?
L55851	u135	m9	REEF	Yes?
L55850	u131	m9	CARL	They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
L55668	u135	m9	REEF	I'd sooner swim!
L55667	u131	m9	CARL	However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
L55666	u135	m9	REEF	- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
L55665	u131	m9	CARL	That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
L55538	u135	m9	REEF	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
L55537	u131	m9	CARL	Unidentified Flying Objects.
L55458	u135	m9	REEF	You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
L55457	u131	m9	CARL	Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
L55456	u135	m9	REEF	You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
L55455	u131	m9	CARL	Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
L55454	u135	m9	REEF	You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
L55453	u131	m9	CARL	That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
L55452	u135	m9	REEF	We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
L55451	u131	m9	CARL	Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
L55450	u135	m9	REEF	<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
L55449	u131	m9	CARL	You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
L55448	u135	m9	REEF	Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
L55447	u131	m9	CARL	What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
L55446	u135	m9	REEF	Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
L55445	u131	m9	CARL	My father!  He's not - ?
L55444	u135	m9	REEF	Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
L55443	u131	m9	CARL	What is it?
L55390	u131	m9	CARL	Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
L55389	u135	m9	REEF	You could train someone else.
L55387	u135	m9	REEF	And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
L55386	u131	m9	CARL	It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
L55385	u135	m9	REEF	How is he - ?
L55384	u131	m9	CARL	It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
L55383	u135	m9	REEF	I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
L55792	u132	m9	DAVE	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
L55791	u135	m9	REEF	Dave - !
L55770	u132	m9	DAVE	Oh it does???
L55769	u135	m9	REEF	Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
L55762	u132	m9	DAVE	I'm with <u>you!</u>
L55761	u135	m9	REEF	Well?
L55759	u135	m9	REEF	We'll have to look for them later.
L55758	u132	m9	DAVE	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
L55757	u135	m9	REEF	Somewhere down there?
L55756	u132	m9	DAVE	Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
L55749	u132	m9	DAVE	The sound again?
L55748	u135	m9	REEF	You hear that?
L55735	u135	m9	REEF	Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
L55734	u132	m9	DAVE	And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
L55733	u135	m9	REEF	You know - it <u>is</u>?
L55732	u132	m9	DAVE	Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
L55729	u135	m9	REEF	Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
L55728	u132	m9	DAVE	I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
L55727	u135	m9	REEF	Listen!  Hear that?
L55726	u132	m9	DAVE	Yeah?
L55699	u135	m9	REEF	Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
L55698	u132	m9	DAVE	I think you're right.
L55697	u135	m9	REEF	What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
L55696	u132	m9	DAVE	How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
L55689	u132	m9	DAVE	Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
L55688	u135	m9	REEF	You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
L55662	u132	m9	DAVE	Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
L55661	u135	m9	REEF	'Us?'
L55660	u132	m9	DAVE	You've got to let us try, Skipper --
L55644	u132	m9	DAVE	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
L55643	u135	m9	REEF	We're stuck tight!
L55571	u132	m9	DAVE	Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
L55570	u135	m9	REEF	Cyclops?
L55436	u135	m9	REEF	'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
L55435	u132	m9	DAVE	Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
L55434	u135	m9	REEF	But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
L55433	u132	m9	DAVE	A lot of people think like that.
L55432	u135	m9	REEF	So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
L55431	u132	m9	DAVE	So?
L55430	u135	m9	REEF	One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
L55429	u132	m9	DAVE	I guess.
L55428	u135	m9	REEF	I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
L55426	u135	m9	REEF	I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
L55425	u132	m9	DAVE	Huh?
L55424	u135	m9	REEF	You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
L55355	u135	m9	REEF	Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
L55354	u132	m9	DAVE	What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
L55353	u135	m9	REEF	<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
L55352	u132	m9	DAVE	At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
L55351	u135	m9	REEF	So they caught up with you, too?
L55350	u132	m9	DAVE	Reef!
L55323	u135	m9	REEF	Helen.  I appeal to you -
L55322	u132	m9	DAVE	But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
L55321	u135	m9	REEF	Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
L55674	u138	m9	WENDOVER	We hope!
L55673	u132	m9	DAVE	Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
L55672	u138	m9	WENDOVER	With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
L55671	u132	m9	DAVE	The frogmen?
L55670	u138	m9	WENDOVER	You better take Powell and Carney with you --
L55627	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Right at our one-eyed friend!
L55626	u132	m9	DAVE	What course, Skipper?
L55622	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What???
L55621	u132	m9	DAVE	A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
L55522	u132	m9	DAVE	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
L55521	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Course and speed?
L55471	u132	m9	DAVE	I...don't know!
L55470	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What about down?
L55469	u132	m9	DAVE	Seems to be all around...
L55468	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Is there any way out of it?
L55380	u132	m9	DAVE	Right, Skipper.
L55379	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
L55714	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What????
L55713	u133	m9	GRIFF	We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
L55712	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Why do you say that?
L55711	u133	m9	GRIFF	The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
L55710	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Something wrong?
L55709	u133	m9	GRIFF	Skipper - could you take a look here...?
L55546	u133	m9	GRIFF	All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
L55545	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Yes, Griff?
L55544	u133	m9	GRIFF	Excuse me, Skipper---
L55827	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What about time...?
L55826	u134	m9	KENT	It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
L55825	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Anything ---
L55824	u134	m9	KENT	Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
L55741	u134	m9	KENT	Radiation level...constantly rising...
L55740	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Now they feel it...down below.
L55705	u138	m9	WENDOVER	That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
L55704	u134	m9	KENT	Wonderful!
L55703	u138	m9	WENDOVER	We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
L55833	u134	m9	KENT	As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
L55832	u137	m9	SIR IAN	All ready?
L55744	u137	m9	SIR IAN	There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
L55743	u134	m9	KENT	There's got to be an explanation!
L55742	u137	m9	SIR IAN	As we near the Pole...
L55717	u137	m9	SIR IAN	What direction does the system indicate?
L55716	u134	m9	KENT	The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
L55564	u134	m9	KENT	If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
L55563	u137	m9	SIR IAN	....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
L55559	u134	m9	KENT	The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
L55558	u137	m9	SIR IAN	<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
L55557	u134	m9	KENT	We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
L55496	u137	m9	SIR IAN	What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
L55495	u134	m9	KENT	Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
L55494	u137	m9	SIR IAN	...above Murmansk, and Finland.
L55467	u134	m9	KENT	High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
L55466	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Under <u>water</u>?
L55465	u134	m9	KENT	It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
L55838	u135	m9	REEF	Minus three.
L55837	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
L55823	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Nothing we can do, now.
L55822	u135	m9	REEF	Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
L55654	u135	m9	REEF	If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
L55653	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What?
L55652	u135	m9	REEF	Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
L55647	u138	m9	WENDOVER	And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
L55646	u135	m9	REEF	It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
L55645	u138	m9	WENDOVER	A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
L55631	u138	m9	WENDOVER	We can <u>ram</u> him!
L55630	u135	m9	REEF	But - what can we accomplish?
L55629	u138	m9	WENDOVER	That's what I said!
L55628	u135	m9	REEF	Right <u>at</u> him?
L55615	u135	m9	REEF	Thirty-four seconds!
L55614	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What's the running time?
L55597	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Take a look.
L55596	u135	m9	REEF	You're sure it's Cyclops?
L55514	u135	m9	REEF	After torpedo room:  Report!
L55513	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Determine extent of damage, immediately.
L55418	u135	m9	REEF	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
L55417	u138	m9	WENDOVER	What do you think?
L55378	u135	m9	REEF	It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
L55377	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Huh?
L55376	u135	m9	REEF	'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
L55375	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
L55374	u135	m9	REEF	Who with?
L55373	u138	m9	WENDOVER	I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
L55361	u135	m9	REEF	I met Dr. Kent, once.
L55360	u138	m9	WENDOVER	I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
L55359	u135	m9	REEF	Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
L55808	u135	m9	REEF	<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
L55807	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	Obviously.
L55806	u135	m9	REEF	To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
L55805	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
L55804	u135	m9	REEF	That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
L55803	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
L55799	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
L55798	u135	m9	REEF	Why?
L55797	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
L55796	u135	m9	REEF	Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
L55790	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	I am afraid not.  Therefore -
L55789	u135	m9	REEF	He did!
L55788	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	Your friend was to remain where he was!
L55787	u135	m9	REEF	Swell!
L55785	u135	m9	REEF	- for horrors like yourself?
L55784	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
L55777	u135	m9	REEF	Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
L55776	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
L55775	u135	m9	REEF	That's a <u>face</u>???
L55765	u135	m9	REEF	Come where?
L55764	u136	m9	SAUCER VOICE	Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
L55829	u138	m9	WENDOVER	All right - go to it.
L55828	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
L55719	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Toward the Pole!
L55718	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
L55555	u138	m9	WENDOVER	But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
L55554	u137	m9	SIR IAN	We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
L55549	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
L55548	u138	m9	WENDOVER	You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
L55532	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
L55531	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
L55519	u137	m9	SIR IAN	I'll be another!
L55518	u138	m9	WENDOVER	Well, I'll be - !
L55482	u137	m9	SIR IAN	The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
L55481	u138	m9	WENDOVER	See what?
L55367	u137	m9	SIR IAN	Thank you.
L55366	u138	m9	WENDOVER	My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
L19087	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	Commissioner, Aquarius.
L19086	u184	m12	KRUGER	Kruger, Sagittarius.
L19032	u184	m12	KRUGER	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
L19031	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
L19030	u184	m12	KRUGER	What's the story?
L19029	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	I was reading too.
L19028	u184	m12	KRUGER	Forget it.  I was reading.
L18588	u184	m12	KRUGER	You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
L18587	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
L18586	u184	m12	KRUGER	I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
L18585	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	That just doesn't make any sense.
L18584	u184	m12	KRUGER	That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
L18382	u184	m12	KRUGER	I just wish it was that simple.
L18381	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	What?
L18380	u184	m12	KRUGER	Commissioner.
L18379	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
L18375	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
L18374	u184	m12	KRUGER	And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
L18373	u178	m12	COMMISSIONER	Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
L18372	u184	m12	KRUGER	Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
L18863	u185	m12	MARY	Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
L18862	u179	m12	DUNN	What is it, Mary?
L18861	u185	m12	MARY	Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
L18860	u179	m12	DUNN	Felt like a large asteroid.
L18859	u185	m12	MARY	Yes I did...
L18858	u179	m12	DUNN	Did you feel that?
L18825	u186	m12	OVEUR	You better take this.
L18824	u179	m12	DUNN	Sir?
L18823	u186	m12	OVEUR	Dunn.
L18822	u186	m12	OVEUR	You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
L18821	u179	m12	DUNN	Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
L18785	u186	m12	OVEUR	You better check it, Unger.
L18784	u179	m12	DUNN	We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
L18716	u179	m12	DUNN	Accelerators down.
L18715	u186	m12	OVEUR	Shut down accelerators.
L18636	u186	m12	OVEUR	Dunn.
L18635	u179	m12	DUNN	Oveur.
L19239	u193	m12	TED	Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
L19238	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, the lever!
L19215	u180	m12	ELAINE	Compute!
L19214	u193	m12	TED	Now!
L19213	u180	m12	ELAINE	Set!
L19212	u193	m12	TED	We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
L19199	u193	m12	TED	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
L19198	u180	m12	ELAINE	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
L19197	u193	m12	TED	Are you afraid?
L19196	u193	m12	TED	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
L19195	u180	m12	ELAINE	What will happen to him, Ted?
L19194	u193	m12	TED	That's right -- premature ejection.
L19193	u180	m12	ELAINE	You mean...
L19192	u193	m12	TED	Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
L19191	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon just ejected!
L19132	u193	m12	TED	That might be the news we've been waiting for.
L19131	u180	m12	ELAINE	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
L19130	u193	m12	TED	Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
L19119	u180	m12	ELAINE	That was very well put, Ted.
L19118	u193	m12	TED	Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
L19113	u180	m12	ELAINE	I mean until we start to burn up.
L19112	u193	m12	TED	Not now, Elaine.
L19111	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
L19053	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, please be careful.
L19052	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
L19012	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, there's no time to explain.
L19011	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, what's going on?
L19010	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted!
L19009	u193	m12	TED	Elaine!
L18801	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
L18800	u193	m12	TED	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
L18799	u180	m12	ELAINE	I'd use the word insane.
L18798	u193	m12	TED	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
L18797	u180	m12	ELAINE	The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
L18796	u193	m12	TED	What word would you use, Elaine?
L18795	u180	m12	ELAINE	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
L18794	u193	m12	TED	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
L18793	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
L18792	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
L18791	u180	m12	ELAINE	We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
L18790	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, we have to go back.
L18789	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
L18788	u193	m12	TED	Elaine.
L18698	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted!
L18697	u193	m12	TED	Not now, Elaine!
L18696	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted.
L18695	u193	m12	TED	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
L18694	u180	m12	ELAINE	What are you doing, Ted?
L18677	u193	m12	TED	Let me by, Elaine.
L18676	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, we're taking off!
L18675	u193	m12	TED	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
L18674	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted!  What are you...?
L18569	u180	m12	ELAINE	Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
L18568	u193	m12	TED	That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
L18567	u180	m12	ELAINE	If that's the way you want it.
L18566	u193	m12	TED	No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
L18564	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
L18563	u193	m12	TED	His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
L18559	u180	m12	ELAINE	And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
L18558	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
L18557	u193	m12	TED	Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
L18556	u180	m12	ELAINE	Who's that, Ted?
L18555	u180	m12	ELAINE	Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
L18548	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
L18547	u193	m12	TED	Elaine, what happened to us?
L18546	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
L18545	u193	m12	TED	Elaine.
L18529	u193	m12	TED	You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
L18528	u180	m12	ELAINE	Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
L18527	u193	m12	TED	There's nothing wrong with me!
L18526	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
L18525	u193	m12	TED	Ask Simon.
L18524	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted, what's wrong?
L18512	u193	m12	TED	I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
L18511	u180	m12	ELAINE	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
L18510	u193	m12	TED	It's got to be stopped!
L18506	u193	m12	TED	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
L18505	u180	m12	ELAINE	Te...!
L18504	u193	m12	TED	Elaine.
L18701	u190	m12	RUMACK	Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
L18700	u180	m12	ELAINE	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
L18699	u190	m12	RUMACK	The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
L18690	u180	m12	ELAINE	Is that a good sign, Doctor?
L18689	u190	m12	RUMACK	You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
L18688	u180	m12	ELAINE	I mean for Ted.
L18687	u190	m12	RUMACK	You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
L18686	u180	m12	ELAINE	What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
L18685	u190	m12	RUMACK	So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
L18684	u190	m12	RUMACK	The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
L18683	u180	m12	ELAINE	Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
L19179	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon, what are you saying?!
L19178	u191	m12	SIMON	Maybe.
L19177	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
L18907	u180	m12	ELAINE	Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
L18906	u191	m12	SIMON	My career is shot.
L18904	u191	m12	SIMON	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
L18903	u180	m12	ELAINE	Can't we change course?
L18902	u191	m12	SIMON	He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
L18901	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon, what's happening?!
L18757	u191	m12	SIMON	Roger.
L18756	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
L18750	u191	m12	SIMON	That's my girl.
L18749	u180	m12	ELAINE	I think so.
L18748	u191	m12	SIMON	Have you got it straightened out now?
L18543	u180	m12	ELAINE	Don't be too long.
L18542	u191	m12	SIMON	Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
L18533	u191	m12	SIMON	So mentally ill?
L18532	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon, why has he become so... so...
L18531	u191	m12	SIMON	Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
L18503	u180	m12	ELAINE	No, I've been excited before.
L18502	u191	m12	SIMON	I guess this is a first for you.
L18501	u180	m12	ELAINE	I'm so excited, Simon.
L18500	u191	m12	SIMON	Frank's the best pilot in the program.
L18397	u191	m12	SIMON	You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
L18396	u180	m12	ELAINE	But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
L18395	u191	m12	SIMON	Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
L18394	u180	m12	ELAINE	And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
L18393	u191	m12	SIMON	Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
L18392	u180	m12	ELAINE	Simon.
L18391	u191	m12	SIMON	For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
L18873	u186	m12	OVEUR	Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
L18872	u180	m12	ELAINE	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
L18871	u186	m12	OVEUR	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
L18870	u180	m12	ELAINE	You can do it from up here, Captain.
L18869	u186	m12	OVEUR	Roger.
L18868	u180	m12	ELAINE	We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
L18867	u186	m12	OVEUR	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
L18866	u180	m12	ELAINE	I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
L18718	u180	m12	ELAINE	Yes, sir.
L18717	u186	m12	OVEUR	Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
L18856	u189	m12	ROK	There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
L18855	u180	m12	ELAINE	Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
L18854	u189	m12	ROK	Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
L18853	u180	m12	ELAINE	Request; life support systems check.
L18852	u189	m12	ROK	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
L18851	u180	m12	ELAINE	Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
L18755	u189	m12	ROK	You have great tits.
L18754	u180	m12	ELAINE	Go ahead.
L18753	u189	m12	ROK	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
L18752	u180	m12	ELAINE	That's okay, ROK.
L18751	u189	m12	ROK	Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
L18725	u189	m12	ROK	Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
L18724	u180	m12	ELAINE	That's not possible.
L18723	u189	m12	ROK	Negative.
L18722	u180	m12	ELAINE	That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
L18721	u189	m12	ROK	Negative.
L18720	u180	m12	ELAINE	"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze."
L18781	u183	m12	JOHN	Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
L18780	u181	m12	JIMMY	No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
L18779	u183	m12	JOHN	How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
L18776	u183	m12	JOHN	It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
L18775	u181	m12	JIMMY	Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
L18774	u183	m12	JOHN	I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
L18773	u181	m12	JIMMY	I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
L18409	u183	m12	JOHN	We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
L18408	u181	m12	JIMMY	Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
L18844	u186	m12	OVEUR	Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
L18843	u181	m12	JIMMY	Yeah.
L18842	u186	m12	OVEUR	He's a boy dog.
L18841	u181	m12	JIMMY	Sure.
L18840	u186	m12	OVEUR	Can I hold him?
L18839	u181	m12	JIMMY	Scraps.
L18838	u186	m12	OVEUR	Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
L18617	u194	m12	WIFE	What...?
L18616	u182	m12	JOE	All right.  Here.
L18615	u194	m12	WIFE	Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
L18614	u182	m12	JOE	I don't want to hear that word!
L18613	u194	m12	WIFE	Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
L18612	u182	m12	JOE	We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
L18611	u194	m12	WIFE	Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
L19151	u193	m12	TED	I'm sure.
L19150	u182	m12	JOE	You're sure?
L19149	u193	m12	TED	That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
L19148	u182	m12	JOE	What?
L19147	u193	m12	TED	Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
L19146	u182	m12	JOE	I don't want to live anymore.
L19145	u193	m12	TED	Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
L18875	u186	m12	OVEUR	Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
L18874	u185	m12	MARY	Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
L18768	u186	m12	OVEUR	Poached!  Not over!  Over!
L18767	u185	m12	MARY	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
L18766	u186	m12	OVEUR	That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
L18764	u186	m12	OVEUR	Just poached on toast.  Over.
L18763	u185	m12	MARY	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
L18762	u186	m12	OVEUR	No.  Poached.  Over.
L18761	u185	m12	MARY	How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
L18760	u186	m12	OVEUR	A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
L19141	u193	m12	TED	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
L19140	u185	m12	MARY	What should I say?
L19139	u193	m12	TED	No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
L19138	u185	m12	MARY	A b...
L19137	u193	m12	TED	He's carrying a bomb.
L19136	u185	m12	MARY	Sixteen 'C', why?
L19135	u193	m12	TED	Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
L18682	u186	m12	OVEUR	Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
L18681	u191	m12	SIMON	Whenever your're ready, Captain.
L18632	u191	m12	SIMON	Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
L18631	u186	m12	OVEUR	Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
L18598	u186	m12	OVEUR	Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
L18597	u191	m12	SIMON	That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
L18593	u191	m12	SIMON	We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
L18592	u186	m12	OVEUR	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
L18591	u191	m12	SIMON	Captain Oveur?
L18475	u192	m12	STELLA	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18474	u187	m12	PORTER	Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
L18473	u192	m12	STELLA	Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
L18472	u187	m12	PORTER	It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
L18471	u192	m12	STELLA	Yes.
L18470	u187	m12	PORTER	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
L18469	u192	m12	STELLA	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
L18468	u187	m12	PORTER	You folks need any help?
L18608	u188	m12	RECEPTIONIST	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
L18607	u193	m12	TED	Don't try to stop me!
L18606	u188	m12	RECEPTIONIST	You can't go in there!
L18605	u188	m12	RECEPTIONIST	Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
L18604	u193	m12	TED	All right, it's a matter of death.
L18603	u188	m12	RECEPTIONIST	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
L18602	u193	m12	TED	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
L18601	u188	m12	RECEPTIONIST	Do you have an appointment, sir?
L18600	u193	m12	TED	I have to see Bud Kruger.
L18989	u193	m12	TED	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
L18988	u191	m12	SIMON	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
L18987	u193	m12	TED	Then Elaine was right.
L18986	u191	m12	SIMON	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
L18985	u193	m12	TED	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
L18984	u191	m12	SIMON	Striker.
L18519	u193	m12	TED	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
L18518	u191	m12	SIMON	You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
L18517	u193	m12	TED	Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
L18516	u191	m12	SIMON	You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
L18509	u191	m12	SIMON	That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
L18508	u193	m12	TED	Are you on the Mercury mission?
L18816	u193	m12	TED	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
L18815	u192	m12	STELLA	No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
L18814	u193	m12	TED	I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
L18813	u192	m12	STELLA	Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
L18812	u193	m12	TED	Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
L18811	u192	m12	STELLA	Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
L18810	u193	m12	TED	People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
L18809	u192	m12	STELLA	Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
L18808	u193	m12	TED	We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
L18807	u192	m12	STELLA	No.  I mean your relationship.
L18806	u193	m12	TED	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
L18805	u192	m12	STELLA	Do you want to talk about it.
L18804	u192	m12	STELLA	No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
L18803	u193	m12	TED	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
L18802	u192	m12	STELLA	You've been hurt.
L18541	u192	m12	STELLA	You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
L18540	u193	m12	TED	I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
L18539	u192	m12	STELLA	Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18538	u193	m12	TED	Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
L18537	u192	m12	STELLA	You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
L18536	u193	m12	TED	Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
L18535	u192	m12	STELLA	Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
L24643	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Yeah...
L24642	u224	m14	SYKES	You okay?
L24424	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
L24423	u224	m14	SYKES	I like my horizons narrow.
L24422	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
L24421	u224	m14	SYKES	There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
L24420	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
L24419	u224	m14	SYKES	Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
L24418	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
L24417	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
L24416	u224	m14	SYKES	The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
L24415	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
L24413	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
L24412	u224	m14	SYKES	Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
L24411	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
L24616	u218	m14	JETSON	Show me.
L24615	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	In there.
L24408	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
L24407	u218	m14	JETSON	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
L24406	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	He's not here.  Why ask me?
L24404	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
L24403	u218	m14	JETSON	We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
L24402	u215	m14	CASSANDRA	That's right.
L24401	u218	m14	JETSON	You are Cassandra?
L24530	u216	m14	FEDORCHUK	I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
L24529	u224	m14	SYKES	Lay off, asshole.
L24528	u216	m14	FEDORCHUK	Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
L24526	u224	m14	SYKES	I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
L24525	u216	m14	FEDORCHUK	Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
L24192	u216	m14	FEDORCHUK	You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
L24191	u224	m14	SYKES	You don't have squat.
L24190	u216	m14	FEDORCHUK	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
L24189	u224	m14	SYKES	So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
L24655	u217	m14	HARCOURT	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
L24654	u224	m14	SYKES	Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
L24316	u217	m14	HARCOURT	That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
L24315	u224	m14	SYKES	You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
L24314	u217	m14	HARCOURT	Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
L24309	u217	m14	HARCOURT	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
L24308	u224	m14	SYKES	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
L24307	u217	m14	HARCOURT	Yes...
L24306	u224	m14	SYKES	William Harcourt?
L24640	u217	m14	HARCOURT	Do it!
L24639	u219	m14	KIPLING	Here?
L24638	u217	m14	HARCOURT	Kill them both.
L24464	u217	m14	HARCOURT	This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
L24463	u219	m14	KIPLING	When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
L24326	u217	m14	HARCOURT	It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
L24325	u219	m14	KIPLING	He didn't recognize me.
L24324	u217	m14	HARCOURT	This is becoming a serious breach of security.
L24323	u219	m14	KIPLING	That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
L24700	u218	m14	JETSON	You look very good.
L24699	u224	m14	SYKES	How do I look?
L24686	u218	m14	JETSON	You understand that.  But how many others will?
L24685	u224	m14	SYKES	But there's no more drug.
L24684	u218	m14	JETSON	Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
L24683	u224	m14	SYKES	Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
L24682	u218	m14	JETSON	We can't let him get away.
L24681	u224	m14	SYKES	I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
L24680	u224	m14	SYKES	Tell me about it...
L24679	u218	m14	JETSON	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
L24678	u224	m14	SYKES	Harcourt is dead.
L24677	u218	m14	JETSON	... It's Harcourt.
L24676	u224	m14	SYKES	What is this?!
L24672	u224	m14	SYKES	Do what?!  George-- ?!
L24671	u218	m14	JETSON	No!  We must do this alone.
L24670	u218	m14	JETSON	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
L24669	u224	m14	SYKES	What's this about, George?  I know that look.
L24657	u224	m14	SYKES	It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
L24656	u218	m14	JETSON	With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
L24651	u218	m14	JETSON	Ss-ai!
L24650	u224	m14	SYKES	Shit!
L24610	u218	m14	JETSON	Fuck procedure.
L24608	u224	m14	SYKES	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
L24607	u218	m14	JETSON	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
L24606	u224	m14	SYKES	George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
L24599	u218	m14	JETSON	Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
L24598	u224	m14	SYKES	George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
L24594	u218	m14	JETSON	Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
L24593	u224	m14	SYKES	Uh, George...
L24588	u224	m14	SYKES	No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
L24587	u218	m14	JETSON	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
L24586	u224	m14	SYKES	Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
L24585	u224	m14	SYKES	Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
L24584	u218	m14	JETSON	They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
L24565	u218	m14	JETSON	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
L24564	u224	m14	SYKES	George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
L24563	u218	m14	JETSON	Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
L24562	u224	m14	SYKES	Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
L24561	u218	m14	JETSON	No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
L24560	u224	m14	SYKES	Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
L24559	u218	m14	JETSON	We all did.
L24558	u224	m14	SYKES	We?  You've taken it?
L24557	u218	m14	JETSON	"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."
L24556	u224	m14	SYKES	How potent?
L24555	u218	m14	JETSON	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
L24554	u224	m14	SYKES	The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
L24553	u218	m14	JETSON	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
L24552	u224	m14	SYKES	No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
L24550	u218	m14	JETSON	You must leave me alone on this.
L24549	u224	m14	SYKES	What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
L24537	u224	m14	SYKES	... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
L24536	u218	m14	JETSON	Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
L24535	u224	m14	SYKES	... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
L24534	u224	m14	SYKES	Nothing.
L24533	u218	m14	JETSON	What was that about?
L24519	u218	m14	JETSON	Thank you.
L24518	u224	m14	SYKES	It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
L24516	u218	m14	JETSON	Stop the car!
L24515	u224	m14	SYKES	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
L24514	u218	m14	JETSON	Please, I must get out here.
L24513	u224	m14	SYKES	Why?
L24512	u218	m14	JETSON	Stop the car.
L24511	u224	m14	SYKES	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
L24510	u218	m14	JETSON	To the... to the beach?
L24509	u224	m14	SYKES	Well, let's roll, George.
L24504	u218	m14	JETSON	She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
L24503	u224	m14	SYKES	George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
L24502	u218	m14	JETSON	She's going to divorce me.
L24501	u218	m14	JETSON	A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
L24500	u224	m14	SYKES	Where'd you get this?!!
L24496	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
L24495	u218	m14	JETSON	I'm going home.
L24490	u224	m14	SYKES	Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
L24489	u218	m14	JETSON	I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
L24488	u218	m14	JETSON	You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
L24487	u224	m14	SYKES	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
L24486	u218	m14	JETSON	There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
L24485	u218	m14	JETSON	Ta ss'trakyona'...
L24484	u224	m14	SYKES	Your health...
L24483	u224	m14	SYKES	Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
L24482	u218	m14	JETSON	In the other man's rectum.
L24481	u224	m14	SYKES	"... and so, and so the doctor says, ""If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?"
L24478	u224	m14	SYKES	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
L24477	u218	m14	JETSON	Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
L24475	u224	m14	SYKES	I appreciate your honesty, George.
L24474	u218	m14	JETSON	Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
L24473	u224	m14	SYKES	It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
L24472	u218	m14	JETSON	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
L24471	u224	m14	SYKES	Was.  Divorced.
L24470	u218	m14	JETSON	You are married?
L24469	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah... I know the routine.
L24468	u218	m14	JETSON	My wife?  She worries about me.
L24467	u224	m14	SYKES	So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
L24446	u224	m14	SYKES	Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
L24445	u218	m14	JETSON	I believe he is probably lying.
L24440	u218	m14	JETSON	When will Strader return?
L24439	u224	m14	SYKES	We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
L24432	u218	m14	JETSON	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
L24431	u224	m14	SYKES	Who is he?
L24400	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
L24399	u218	m14	JETSON	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
L24398	u224	m14	SYKES	And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
L24397	u218	m14	JETSON	"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."
L24396	u224	m14	SYKES	So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
L24394	u218	m14	JETSON	Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
L24393	u224	m14	SYKES	I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
L24392	u218	m14	JETSON	This is mole.  It's good.
L24391	u224	m14	SYKES	Which one is that?  Raw what?
L24387	u218	m14	JETSON	Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
L24386	u224	m14	SYKES	I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
L24384	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
L24383	u218	m14	JETSON	If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
L24375	u218	m14	JETSON	In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
L24374	u224	m14	SYKES	How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
L24373	u218	m14	JETSON	From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
L24372	u224	m14	SYKES	You know that guy?
L24368	u224	m14	SYKES	Stay back!  I'm okay.
L24367	u218	m14	JETSON	Matthew, you don't have to-- .
L24366	u224	m14	SYKES	That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
L24365	u218	m14	JETSON	Your mother mates out of season.
L24364	u224	m14	SYKES	Tell me.
L24361	u224	m14	SYKES	Screw me?  That can't be right.
L24360	u218	m14	JETSON	Screw you.
L24356	u224	m14	SYKES	I'll handle it.
L24355	u218	m14	JETSON	But I-- .
L24354	u224	m14	SYKES	Back off, George.
L24353	u218	m14	JETSON	Uh, Matthew...
L24352	u224	m14	SYKES	Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
L24346	u218	m14	JETSON	At the end of the bar.
L24345	u224	m14	SYKES	Who said that?
L24339	u224	m14	SYKES	My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
L24338	u218	m14	JETSON	Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
L24337	u224	m14	SYKES	Why'd I do what?
L24336	u218	m14	JETSON	Why did you do it?
L24313	u218	m14	JETSON	We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
L24312	u224	m14	SYKES	Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
L24302	u218	m14	JETSON	He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
L24301	u224	m14	SYKES	Did you talk to him?
L24300	u218	m14	JETSON	She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
L24299	u224	m14	SYKES	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
L24298	u218	m14	JETSON	A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
L24297	u224	m14	SYKES	Did you learn anything?
L24296	u218	m14	JETSON	Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
L24284	u224	m14	SYKES	Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
L24283	u218	m14	JETSON	I believe I should interview the widow alone.
L24282	u224	m14	SYKES	"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."
L24281	u218	m14	JETSON	A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
L24280	u224	m14	SYKES	How the hell do you know that?
L24279	u218	m14	JETSON	Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
L24276	u218	m14	JETSON	And still it fits?
L24275	u224	m14	SYKES	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
L24274	u218	m14	JETSON	And that fits?
L24273	u224	m14	SYKES	Get the picture?
L24271	u224	m14	SYKES	A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
L24270	u218	m14	JETSON	What is this?
L24269	u218	m14	JETSON	Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
L24268	u224	m14	SYKES	Nothing?
L24267	u218	m14	JETSON	Nothing.
L24266	u224	m14	SYKES	What's this?  What's going on?
L24248	u224	m14	SYKES	Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
L24247	u218	m14	JETSON	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
L24246	u224	m14	SYKES	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
L24245	u218	m14	JETSON	Well... yes, quite possibly.
L24244	u224	m14	SYKES	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
L24243	u218	m14	JETSON	What is wrong?
L24241	u224	m14	SYKES	Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
L24240	u218	m14	JETSON	Yes.
L24239	u224	m14	SYKES	Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
L24238	u218	m14	JETSON	The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
L24237	u224	m14	SYKES	The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
L24236	u218	m14	JETSON	There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
L24235	u224	m14	SYKES	Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
L24233	u224	m14	SYKES	Nice signal, dickwad!
L24232	u218	m14	JETSON	Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
L24231	u224	m14	SYKES	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
L24230	u218	m14	JETSON	His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
L24229	u224	m14	SYKES	Let's talk Hubley.
L24227	u218	m14	JETSON	"That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"", two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium""."
L24226	u224	m14	SYKES	Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
L24225	u224	m14	SYKES	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
L24224	u218	m14	JETSON	My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
L24223	u224	m14	SYKES	Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
L24221	u218	m14	JETSON	I am George.
L24220	u224	m14	SYKES	What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
L24219	u218	m14	JETSON	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
L24218	u224	m14	SYKES	... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
L24333	u224	m14	SYKES	No... two.
L24332	u220	m14	MAFFET	Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
L24331	u224	m14	SYKES	Only holds five.
L24330	u220	m14	MAFFET	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
L24329	u224	m14	SYKES	What is it?
L24328	u220	m14	MAFFET	You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
L24601	u221	m14	O'NEAL	... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
L24600	u224	m14	SYKES	Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
L24294	u221	m14	O'NEAL	Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
L24293	u224	m14	SYKES	That where Anderson worked?
L24292	u224	m14	SYKES	I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
L24291	u221	m14	O'NEAL	Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
L24290	u224	m14	SYKES	Who else can I ask around here?
L24289	u221	m14	O'NEAL	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
L24288	u224	m14	SYKES	We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
L24287	u221	m14	O'NEAL	You think this is the guy who did it?
L24286	u224	m14	SYKES	Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
L24285	u221	m14	O'NEAL	Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
L24579	u222	m14	OPERATOR	Sure.  Just a minute.
L24578	u224	m14	SYKES	Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
L24575	u222	m14	OPERATOR	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
L24574	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
L24573	u222	m14	OPERATOR	Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
L24570	u222	m14	OPERATOR	For you, anything.
L24569	u224	m14	SYKES	Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
L24568	u222	m14	OPERATOR	Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
L24381	u223	m14	PORTER	That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
L24380	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, I heard of it.
L24379	u223	m14	PORTER	Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
L24378	u224	m14	SYKES	One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
L24359	u224	m14	SYKES	What's that?
L24358	u223	m14	PORTER	Ss'kya'ta'.
L24357	u224	m14	SYKES	Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
L24546	u224	m14	SYKES	Did he find anything?
L24545	u227	m14	WINTER	Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
L24544	u224	m14	SYKES	What kind of test?
L24539	u227	m14	WINTER	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
L24538	u224	m14	SYKES	You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
L24265	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, I'll bet.
L24264	u227	m14	WINTER	Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
L24263	u227	m14	WINTER	That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
L24262	u224	m14	SYKES	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
L24261	u227	m14	WINTER	Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
L24260	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah.
L24259	u227	m14	WINTER	You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
L24258	u224	m14	SYKES	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
L24257	u227	m14	WINTER	No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
L24254	u227	m14	WINTER	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
L24253	u224	m14	SYKES	The human?
L24252	u227	m14	WINTER	Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
L24251	u224	m14	SYKES	Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
L24250	u227	m14	WINTER	You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
L24216	u226	m14	WARNER	Don't tell me what to think.
L24215	u224	m14	SYKES	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
L24214	u226	m14	WARNER	Granger and Pitts are already on it.
L24210	u226	m14	WARNER	You?
L24209	u224	m14	SYKES	Departmental policy.
L24208	u226	m14	WARNER	You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
L24204	u224	m14	SYKES	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
L24203	u226	m14	WARNER	Yeah, Sykes?
L24167	u224	m14	SYKES	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
L24166	u225	m14	TUGGLE	I can't!  Do you mind!
L24165	u224	m14	SYKES	Get outta there!
L24163	u224	m14	SYKES	I got him.  Don't get pinned.
L24162	u225	m14	TUGGLE	Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
L24161	u224	m14	SYKES	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
L24160	u225	m14	TUGGLE	Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
L24159	u224	m14	SYKES	You got your vest?
L24156	u225	m14	TUGGLE	Whatever gave you that idea?
L24155	u224	m14	SYKES	Does that look at all suspicious to you?
L24153	u224	m14	SYKES	Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
L24152	u225	m14	TUGGLE	But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
L24151	u224	m14	SYKES	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
L24150	u225	m14	TUGGLE	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
L24149	u224	m14	SYKES	What?
L24148	u225	m14	TUGGLE	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
L24147	u224	m14	SYKES	How can I go?
L24145	u225	m14	TUGGLE	It is. 
L24144	u224	m14	SYKES	Hope their plumbing's the same.
L26618	u233	m15	HUDSON	Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
L26617	u228	m15	APONE	Talk to me, Hudson.
L26616	u233	m15	HUDSON	Can't lock up...
L26615	u228	m15	APONE	Position?
L26614	u233	m15	HUDSON	Movement!
L26401	u228	m15	APONE	Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
L26400	u233	m15	HUDSON	Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
L26399	u228	m15	APONE	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
L26398	u233	m15	HUDSON	Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
L26387	u233	m15	HUDSON	Would you, Sir?
L26386	u228	m15	APONE	Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
L26385	u233	m15	HUDSON	This floor's freezing.
L26632	u228	m15	APONE	Say again?  All after incinerators?
L26631	u231	m15	GORMAN	Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
L26606	u228	m15	APONE	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
L26605	u231	m15	GORMAN	Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
L26487	u228	m15	APONE	Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
L26486	u231	m15	GORMAN	First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
L26485	u228	m15	APONE	Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
L26484	u231	m15	GORMAN	Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
L26480	u228	m15	APONE	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
L26479	u231	m15	GORMAN	Okay, let's do it.
L26474	u228	m15	APONE	Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
L26473	u231	m15	GORMAN	...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
L26972	u229	m15	BISHOP	Well, thanks, I --
L26971	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You did okay, Bishop.
L26945	u229	m15	BISHOP	In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
L26944	u237	m15	RIPLEY	She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
L26943	u229	m15	BISHOP	Ripley...
L26942	u237	m15	RIPLEY	WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
L26941	u229	m15	BISHOP	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
L26940	u237	m15	RIPLEY	HOW MUCH TIME?
L26808	u229	m15	BISHOP	See you soon.
L26807	u237	m15	RIPLEY	It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
L26803	u237	m15	RIPLEY	All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
L26802	u229	m15	BISHOP	I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
L26801	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What?
L26800	u229	m15	BISHOP	I'll go.
L26789	u229	m15	BISHOP	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
L26788	u237	m15	RIPLEY	And it's too late to shut it down?
L26785	u229	m15	BISHOP	I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
L26784	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How long until it blows?
L26783	u229	m15	BISHOP	That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
L26759	u229	m15	BISHOP	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
L26758	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Could it be intelligent?
L26757	u229	m15	BISHOP	Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
L26756	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
L26755	u229	m15	BISHOP	That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
L26754	u237	m15	RIPLEY	But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
L26753	u229	m15	BISHOP	Yes.  That follows.
L26752	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
L26751	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
L26750	u229	m15	BISHOP	I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
L26774	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Sorry to disappoint you.
L26773	u230	m15	BURKE	I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
L26770	u230	m15	BURKE	Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
L26769	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
L26768	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
L26767	u230	m15	BURKE	Now, wait a second --
L26766	u237	m15	RIPLEY	But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
L26765	u230	m15	BURKE	You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
L26764	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
L26763	u230	m15	BURKE	Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
L26682	u237	m15	RIPLEY	This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
L26681	u230	m15	BURKE	Corporal Hicks!?
L26680	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
L26679	u230	m15	BURKE	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
L26678	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You son of a bitch.
L26673	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Bullshit!
L26672	u230	m15	BURKE	This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
L26671	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
L26670	u230	m15	BURKE	Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
L26669	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Why not?
L26668	u230	m15	BURKE	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
L26667	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
L26597	u230	m15	BURKE	She's right.
L26596	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
L26595	u230	m15	BURKE	Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
L26594	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
L26476	u230	m15	BURKE	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
L26475	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That the atmosphere processor?
L26442	u230	m15	BURKE	I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
L26441	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I hope you're right.  I really do.
L26408	u230	m15	BURKE	Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
L26407	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
L26378	u230	m15	BURKE	That's the plan.  My word on it.
L26377	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
L26376	u230	m15	BURKE	Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
L26374	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
L26373	u230	m15	BURKE	Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
L26372	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
L26371	u230	m15	BURKE	If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
L26370	u237	m15	RIPLEY	If I go.
L26369	u230	m15	BURKE	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
L26368	u237	m15	RIPLEY	It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
L26367	u230	m15	BURKE	Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
L26366	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That's right.
L26365	u230	m15	BURKE	I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
L26364	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
L26363	u230	m15	BURKE	Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
L26362	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What about you?  What's your interest in this?
L26357	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
L26356	u230	m15	BURKE	Hear me out...
L26355	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No.  There's no way!
L26309	u230	m15	BURKE	You are a head case.  Have a donut.
L26308	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
L26307	u230	m15	BURKE	You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
L26287	u230	m15	BURKE	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
L26286	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I get the picture.
L26285	u230	m15	BURKE	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
L26284	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
L26280	u230	m15	BURKE	Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
L26279	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Amy.
L26278	u230	m15	BURKE	Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
L26277	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Is she...?
L26276	u230	m15	BURKE	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
L26275	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Have they located my daughter yet?
L26266	u230	m15	BURKE	You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
L26265	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
L26602	u231	m15	GORMAN	Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
L26601	u230	m15	BURKE	We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
L26550	u231	m15	GORMAN	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
L26549	u230	m15	BURKE	What's he scanning for?
L26513	u230	m15	BURKE	It's insured.
L26512	u231	m15	GORMAN	Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
L26448	u231	m15	GORMAN	Dead on all channels.
L26447	u230	m15	BURKE	Still nothing from the colony?
L26361	u231	m15	GORMAN	We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
L26360	u230	m15	BURKE	These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
L26359	u231	m15	GORMAN	You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
L26358	u230	m15	BURKE	Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
L26836	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Forget it.
L26835	u231	m15	GORMAN	All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
L26834	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How do you feel?
L26639	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They're but off!  Do something!
L26638	u231	m15	GORMAN	I told them to fall back...
L26630	u231	m15	GORMAN	Shut up.  Just shut up!
L26629	u237	m15	RIPLEY	GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
L26600	u231	m15	GORMAN	So?  So?
L26599	u237	m15	RIPLEY	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
L26598	u231	m15	GORMAN	So.
L26587	u231	m15	GORMAN	Proceed inside.
L26586	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I don't know.
L26585	u231	m15	GORMAN	What is it?
L26541	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
L26540	u231	m15	GORMAN	Where are your parents?  You have to try...
L26528	u231	m15	GORMAN	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
L26527	u237	m15	RIPLEY	One of us?
L26478	u237	m15	RIPLEY	The structure seems intact.  They have power.
L26477	u231	m15	GORMAN	Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
L26468	u231	m15	GORMAN	Thirty-eight...simulated.
L26467	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
L26584	u233	m15	HUDSON	You tell me.  I only work here.
L26583	u231	m15	GORMAN	We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
L26573	u233	m15	HUDSON	Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
L26572	u231	m15	GORMAN	Alive?
L26571	u233	m15	HUDSON	Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
L26507	u231	m15	GORMAN	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
L26506	u233	m15	HUDSON	Sir, the CPU is on-line.
L26504	u233	m15	HUDSON	He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
L26503	u231	m15	GORMAN	...We're coming in.
L26502	u231	m15	GORMAN	All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
L26444	u233	m15	HUDSON	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
L26443	u231	m15	GORMAN	Are there any questions?  Hudson?
L26423	u231	m15	GORMAN	All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
L26422	u233	m15	HUDSON	Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
L26421	u231	m15	GORMAN	What's the question?
L26420	u233	m15	HUDSON	Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
L26419	u231	m15	GORMAN	Yes, Hicks?
L26418	u233	m15	HUDSON	Sir?
L26417	u231	m15	GORMAN	At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
L26900	u232	m15	HICKS	Fuckin' A!
L26899	u233	m15	HUDSON	Let's go!  Let's go!
L26895	u233	m15	HUDSON	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
L26894	u232	m15	HICKS	Well you're not reading it right!
L26884	u232	m15	HICKS	Let's get these things lit.
L26883	u233	m15	HUDSON	Seventeen meters.
L26854	u233	m15	HUDSON	Do it!
L26853	u232	m15	HICKS	The corner!  Ready?
L26819	u232	m15	HICKS	I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
L26818	u233	m15	HUDSON	Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
L26787	u233	m15	HUDSON	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
L26786	u232	m15	HICKS	We got problems.
L26716	u233	m15	HUDSON	Aye-firmative.
L26715	u232	m15	HICKS	Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
L26694	u232	m15	HICKS	Are you finished?  You okay?
L26693	u233	m15	HUDSON	Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
L26627	u232	m15	HICKS	Not that tunnel, the other one!
L26626	u233	m15	HUDSON	Let's get the fuck out of here!
L26460	u233	m15	HUDSON	Sure, Hicks.
L26459	u232	m15	HICKS	Save it.
L26951	u232	m15	HICKS	Don't be long, Ellen.
L26950	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Ellen.
L26947	u232	m15	HICKS	We ain't going anywhere.
L26946	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Hicks, don't let him leave.
L26938	u232	m15	HICKS	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
L26937	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
L26903	u232	m15	HICKS	Stand back.
L26902	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Locked.
L26886	u232	m15	HICKS	We didn't miss anything.
L26885	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
L26877	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
L26876	u232	m15	HICKS	It's game time.
L26864	u232	m15	HICKS	Let's waste him.  No offense.
L26863	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
L26860	u237	m15	RIPLEY	The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
L26859	u232	m15	HICKS	Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
L26833	u232	m15	HICKS	Yeah.  I've noticed.
L26832	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
L26831	u232	m15	HICKS	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
L26830	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What's this?
L26824	u232	m15	HICKS	If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
L26823	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
L26822	u232	m15	HICKS	Maybe.  Maybe not.
L26821	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They'll get us.
L26817	u237	m15	RIPLEY	But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
L26816	u232	m15	HICKS	Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
L26813	u232	m15	HICKS	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
L26812	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Now many?
L26810	u237	m15	RIPLEY	On my way.
L26809	u232	m15	HICKS	They're in the approach corridor.
L26714	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
L26713	u232	m15	HICKS	We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
L26712	u237	m15	RIPLEY	All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
L26703	u232	m15	HICKS	About seventeen days.
L26702	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
L26525	u232	m15	HICKS	Poor bastard.
L26524	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
L26873	u233	m15	HUDSON	No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
L26872	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	You're just reading me.
L26871	u233	m15	HUDSON	It's inside the complex.
L26791	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	Hudson, give us a break.
L26790	u233	m15	HUDSON	Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
L26675	u233	m15	HUDSON	Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
L26674	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
L26666	u233	m15	HUDSON	Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
L26665	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
L26439	u233	m15	HUDSON	Anytime.  Anywhere.
L26438	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	Fuck you.
L26437	u233	m15	HUDSON	Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
L26389	u240	m15	VASQUEZ	No.  Have you?
L26388	u233	m15	HUDSON	Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
L26893	u233	m15	HUDSON	It's readin' right.  Look!
L26892	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
L26891	u233	m15	HUDSON	Nine meters.  Eight.
L26890	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
L26889	u233	m15	HUDSON	Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
L26888	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
L26887	u233	m15	HUDSON	Fifteen meters.
L26882	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Seal the door.
L26881	u233	m15	HUDSON	Range twenty meters.
L26879	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Just get back here!
L26878	u233	m15	HUDSON	This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
L26867	u233	m15	HUDSON	What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
L26866	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They cut the power.
L26799	u233	m15	HUDSON	Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
L26798	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
L26796	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
L26795	u233	m15	HUDSON	Think of what?  We're fucked.
L26794	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
L26793	u233	m15	HUDSON	How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
L26792	u237	m15	RIPLEY	We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
L26724	u233	m15	HUDSON	Uh, what's next?
L26723	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Thanks.
L26711	u233	m15	HUDSON	Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
L26710	u237	m15	RIPLEY	This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
L26705	u237	m15	RIPLEY	She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
L26704	u233	m15	HUDSON	Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
L26663	u233	m15	HUDSON	Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
L26662	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
L26660	u233	m15	HUDSON	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
L26659	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Looks like it stung him.
L26431	u237	m15	RIPLEY	The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
L26430	u233	m15	HUDSON	Sounds like you, Hicks.
L26326	u238	m15	SIMPSON	Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
L26325	u234	m15	LYDECKER	So what do I tell this guy?
L26324	u238	m15	SIMPSON	Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
L26323	u234	m15	LYDECKER	There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
L26322	u238	m15	SIMPSON	Yeah.  What?
L26321	u234	m15	LYDECKER	You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
L26271	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No.. I've slept enough.
L26270	u235	m15	MED-TECH	Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
L26257	u235	m15	MED-TECH	Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
L26256	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How long have I been on Gateway station?
L26255	u235	m15	MED-TECH	Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
L26254	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Terrible.
L26253	u235	m15	MED-TECH	And how are we today?
L26983	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
L26982	u236	m15	NEWT	Can we dream?
L26981	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That's right.
L26980	u236	m15	NEWT	Are we going to sleep now?
L26979	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Right here, baby.  Right here.
L26978	u236	m15	NEWT	Mommy...Mommy?
L26957	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
L26956	u236	m15	NEWT	I knew you'd come.
L26922	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Newt, wait!
L26921	u236	m15	NEWT	This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
L26912	u236	m15	NEWT	Sure.  Go left.
L26911	u237	m15	RIPLEY	DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
L26910	u236	m15	NEWT	Come on.  Crawl faster.
L26898	u236	m15	NEWT	Look!
L26897	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Burke!  Open the door!
L26851	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I know, honey.  Me too.
L26850	u236	m15	NEWT	Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
L26844	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
L26843	u236	m15	NEWT	Wah...?  Where are...?
L26842	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Newt.  Newt, wake up.
L26747	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
L26746	u236	m15	NEWT	Don't go!  Please.
L26743	u236	m15	NEWT	You mean dead.
L26742	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Gone.
L26741	u236	m15	NEWT	Where is she?
L26740	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Yes.  A little girl.
L26739	u236	m15	NEWT	Did you ever have a baby?
L26738	u237	m15	RIPLEY	No, it's different, honey.
L26737	u236	m15	NEWT	Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
L26736	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
L26735	u236	m15	NEWT	Did one of those things grow inside her?
L26734	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
L26733	u236	m15	NEWT	Why do they tell little kids that?
L26732	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Yes, there are, aren't there.
L26731	u236	m15	NEWT	My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
L26730	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
L26729	u236	m15	NEWT	Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
L26726	u236	m15	NEWT	I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
L26725	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
L26697	u236	m15	NEWT	You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
L26696	u237	m15	RIPLEY	I'm sorry, Newt.
L26695	u236	m15	NEWT	I guess we're not leaving, right?
L26580	u237	m15	RIPLEY	You're really something, ace.
L26579	u236	m15	NEWT	Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
L26578	u237	m15	RIPLEY	The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
L26577	u236	m15	NEWT	I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
L26569	u236	m15	NEWT	And hope to die?
L26568	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Cross my heart.
L26567	u236	m15	NEWT	You promise?
L26566	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
L26565	u236	m15	NEWT	They're dead.
L26564	u237	m15	RIPLEY	They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
L26562	u236	m15	NEWT	Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
L26561	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Why not?
L26560	u236	m15	NEWT	I don't want you for a friend.
L26559	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What about me?
L26558	u236	m15	NEWT	Casey.  She's my only friend.
L26555	u236	m15	NEWT	Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
L26554	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What did you say?
L26318	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Sweet Jesus.
L26317	u239	m15	VAN LEUWEN	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
L26316	u237	m15	RIPLEY	How many colonists?
L26314	u237	m15	RIPLEY	What are you talking about. What people?
L26313	u239	m15	VAN LEUWEN	Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
L26312	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Why won't you check out LV-426?
L26304	u237	m15	RIPLEY	...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
L26303	u239	m15	VAN LEUWEN	Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
L26302	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
L26297	u237	m15	RIPLEY	That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
L26296	u239	m15	VAN LEUWEN	The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
L26293	u239	m15	VAN LEUWEN	It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
L26292	u237	m15	RIPLEY	Look, I told you...
L88357	u529	m34	BATTY	That wouldn't be very sporting.
L88356	u538	m34	MARY	Then go get him.
L88355	u529	m34	BATTY	One man.  He must be good.
L88349	u529	m34	BATTY	You underestimate the trap, Mary.
L88348	u538	m34	MARY	Not to be trapped.
L88347	u529	m34	BATTY	What's the point?
L88346	u538	m34	MARY	Anywhere.
L88345	u529	m34	BATTY	Where?
L88344	u538	m34	MARY	Let's go while there is still time.
L88238	u529	m34	BATTY	Pris?
L88237	u538	m34	MARY	I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
L88236	u529	m34	BATTY	I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
L88143	u529	m34	BATTY	Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
L88142	u538	m34	MARY	If he won't cooperate?
L88141	u529	m34	BATTY	He knows what he's doing.
L88121	u529	m34	BATTY	Well stocked.
L88120	u538	m34	MARY	You certainly have a nice place here.
L88119	u529	m34	BATTY	We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
L88118	u538	m34	MARY	We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
L88117	u529	m34	BATTY	Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
L88306	u529	m34	BATTY	Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
L88305	u544	m34	TYRELL	Also extraordinary things.
L88304	u529	m34	BATTY	I've done some questionable things.
L88302	u529	m34	BATTY	I am?
L88301	u544	m34	TYRELL	Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
L88300	u544	m34	TYRELL	Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
L88299	u529	m34	BATTY	But not to last.
L88298	u544	m34	TYRELL	Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
L88297	u529	m34	BATTY	Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
L88296	u544	m34	TYRELL	We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
L88295	u529	m34	BATTY	What about E.M.S. recombination?
L88294	u544	m34	TYRELL	Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
L88293	u529	m34	BATTY	Why?
L88292	u544	m34	TYRELL	The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
L88290	u544	m34	TYRELL	Come here.
L88289	u529	m34	BATTY	I want more life, fucker.
L88288	u544	m34	TYRELL	I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
L88287	u529	m34	BATTY	Death.
L88286	u544	m34	TYRELL	What's the problem?
L88285	u529	m34	BATTY	Had in mind something a little more radical.
L88284	u544	m34	TYRELL	Would you like to be modified?
L88283	u529	m34	BATTY	Can the maker repair what he makes?
L88282	u544	m34	TYRELL	And what can he do for you?
L88281	u529	m34	BATTY	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
L88280	u544	m34	TYRELL	I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
L88276	u544	m34	TYRELL	Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
L88275	u529	m34	BATTY	Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
L88271	u544	m34	TYRELL	Oh?
L88270	u529	m34	BATTY	The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
L88352	u529	m34	BATTY	No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
L88351	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Just thought I'd...
L88350	u529	m34	BATTY	Where are you going, Sebastian?
L88240	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Thank you.
L88239	u529	m34	BATTY	You're our best and only friend.
L88233	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	This afternoon.
L88232	u529	m34	BATTY	When do you deliver your project?
L88231	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	No.
L88230	u529	m34	BATTY	Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
L88229	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	I'd be happy to mention it to him.
L88228	u529	m34	BATTY	His company made us.
L88227	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	He could?
L88226	u529	m34	BATTY	Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
L88225	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
L88224	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Dr. Tyrell?
L88223	u529	m34	BATTY	What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
L88222	u529	m34	BATTY	If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
L88221	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
L88220	u529	m34	BATTY	You could help us.
L88219	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Of course not.
L88218	u529	m34	BATTY	Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
L88217	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
L88216	u529	m34	BATTY	We have a lot in common.
L88212	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Like...
L88211	u529	m34	BATTY	Like what?
L88210	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Show me something?
L88207	u529	m34	BATTY	Nexus - 6.
L88206	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	What generation are you?
L88203	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You're androids.
L88202	u529	m34	BATTY	What, Sebastian?
L88201	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You're just all so... so different.
L88200	u529	m34	BATTY	Why are you staring at us?
L88130	u529	m34	BATTY	Well, actually
L88129	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
L88128	u529	m34	BATTY	If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
L88127	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
L88125	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
L88124	u529	m34	BATTY	I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
L88359	u529	m34	BATTY	Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
L88358	u539	m34	PRIS	I want to do it.
L88215	u529	m34	BATTY	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
L88214	u539	m34	PRIS	I think, therefore I am.
L88138	u529	m34	BATTY	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
L88137	u539	m34	PRIS	Then we're stupid and we'll die.
L88114	u529	m34	BATTY	Hello, glad to meet you.
L88113	u539	m34	PRIS	This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
L87923	u539	m34	PRIS	Tomorrow, he says.
L87922	u529	m34	BATTY	When?
L87921	u539	m34	PRIS	He's not ready yet.
L87920	u529	m34	BATTY	What's going on down there?
L88328	u530	m34	BRYANT	Go.
L88327	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.  I got it.
L88326	u530	m34	BRYANT	If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
L88325	u530	m34	BRYANT	Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
L88324	u532	m34	DECKARD	Got it.
L88323	u530	m34	BRYANT	Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
L88322	u532	m34	DECKARD	Who.
L88321	u530	m34	BRYANT	She's not with you?
L88320	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L88319	u530	m34	BRYANT	This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
L88318	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L88047	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L88046	u530	m34	BRYANT	Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
L88044	u530	m34	BRYANT	You didn't like her!?
L88043	u532	m34	DECKARD	I didn't like her.
L88041	u530	m34	BRYANT	Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
L88040	u532	m34	DECKARD	She was gonna get away.
L87960	u530	m34	BRYANT	If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
L87959	u532	m34	DECKARD	I was just about to have my dinner.
L87958	u530	m34	BRYANT	Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
L87957	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L87705	u532	m34	DECKARD	Garbage man?
L87704	u530	m34	BRYANT	Industrial refuse.
L87703	u532	m34	DECKARD	What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
L87702	u530	m34	BRYANT	The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
L87701	u532	m34	DECKARD	Where do we start?
L87700	u530	m34	BRYANT	We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
L87699	u532	m34	DECKARD	You got a machine on it yet?
L87698	u530	m34	BRYANT	There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
L87697	u532	m34	DECKARD	What was he after?
L87696	u530	m34	BRYANT	Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
L87695	u532	m34	DECKARD	Six, huh?
L87730	u531	m34	CHEW	Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
L87729	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Day after tomorrow.
L87728	u531	m34	CHEW	When might that be?
L87727	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Soon as I finish the job.
L87726	u531	m34	CHEW	Well, when do you get paid?
L87722	u531	m34	CHEW	Your customer, eh?
L87721	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	It's gotta be right for my customer.
L87971	u534	m34	ESPER	Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
L87970	u532	m34	DECKARD	Number three.
L87969	u534	m34	ESPER	Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
L87968	u532	m34	DECKARD	Next.
L87967	u534	m34	ESPER	Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
L87966	u532	m34	DECKARD	Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
L87965	u534	m34	ESPER	Longevity is classified.  No.
L87964	u532	m34	DECKARD	Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
L87963	u534	m34	ESPER	Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
L87802	u532	m34	DECKARD	The umbrella.
L87801	u534	m34	ESPER	And what in your estimation works?
L87800	u532	m34	DECKARD	Not if it works.
L87799	u534	m34	ESPER	Do you have something against science?
L87798	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yes?
L87796	u532	m34	DECKARD	I think we're through for the night.
L87795	u534	m34	ESPER	What about a summary then.
L87794	u532	m34	DECKARD	I know all that.
L87793	u534	m34	ESPER	Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
L87765	u534	m34	ESPER	I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
L87764	u532	m34	DECKARD	Okay, but...
L87763	u534	m34	ESPER	Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
L87762	u532	m34	DECKARD	How do I stop one?
L87761	u534	m34	ESPER	The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
L87760	u532	m34	DECKARD	You start.
L87759	u534	m34	ESPER	Why, yes, of course.
L87758	u532	m34	DECKARD	You equipped for random questions?
L87757	u534	m34	ESPER	This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
L87756	u532	m34	DECKARD	Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
L88088	u532	m34	DECKARD	Four years.
L88087	u537	m34	LEON	My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
L88086	u532	m34	DECKARD	I don't know.
L88085	u537	m34	LEON	How old am I?
L88081	u532	m34	DECKARD	I gotta piss.
L88080	u537	m34	LEON	One more, eh?
L88079	u532	m34	DECKARD	I like you too.
L88078	u537	m34	LEON	I like you.
L88076	u532	m34	DECKARD	No thanks.
L88075	u537	m34	LEON	You like to kiss her goodbye.
L88071	u532	m34	DECKARD	Prosit.
L88070	u537	m34	LEON	Prosit.
L88068	u537	m34	LEON	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
L88067	u532	m34	DECKARD	How long you had these guys?
L88066	u537	m34	LEON	Ya.
L88065	u532	m34	DECKARD	Those cockroaches?
L88064	u537	m34	LEON	No problem.
L88063	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sorry, don't have the time.
L88062	u537	m34	LEON	You want to see my friends?
L88061	u532	m34	DECKARD	Prosit.
L88060	u537	m34	LEON	Prosit.
L88059	u532	m34	DECKARD	My pleasure.
L88058	u537	m34	LEON	Thank you very much.
L88057	u532	m34	DECKARD	Shot of vodka, please.
L88056	u537	m34	LEON	Vodka!
L88055	u532	m34	DECKARD	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
L88054	u537	m34	LEON	But I would like to buy you drink.
L88053	u532	m34	DECKARD	It's okay.  Forget it.
L88052	u537	m34	LEON	I think I have no money.
L88164	u536	m34	HOLDEN	I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
L88163	u532	m34	DECKARD	These aren't just...
L88162	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
L88158	u536	m34	HOLDEN	I'm taking a piss.
L88157	u532	m34	DECKARD	What's that?
L88156	u532	m34	DECKARD	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
L88155	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Let's hear it.
L88154	u532	m34	DECKARD	No.  I got a problem.
L88153	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Money?
L88152	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
L88151	u536	m34	HOLDEN	From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
L88150	u532	m34	DECKARD	I'm doing okay.
L88149	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
L88148	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sorry.
L88147	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
L88146	u532	m34	DECKARD	Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
L88145	u536	m34	HOLDEN	I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
L87915	u532	m34	DECKARD	Me too.
L87914	u546	m34	WHEELER	My job is here.
L87913	u532	m34	DECKARD	But if you could?
L87912	u546	m34	WHEELER	Too old.
L87911	u532	m34	DECKARD	Why didn't you go?
L87910	u532	m34	DECKARD	Never been more sure of anything in my life.
L87909	u546	m34	WHEELER	You sure?
L87908	u532	m34	DECKARD	They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
L87907	u546	m34	WHEELER	What if you change your mind?
L87906	u532	m34	DECKARD	Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
L87905	u546	m34	WHEELER	You're going to be over the limit.
L87904	u532	m34	DECKARD	Nope.
L87903	u546	m34	WHEELER	But you haven't put in for emigration.
L87901	u532	m34	DECKARD	True.
L87900	u546	m34	WHEELER	Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
L87899	u532	m34	DECKARD	Huh huh.
L87898	u546	m34	WHEELER	Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
L87897	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah?
L87896	u546	m34	WHEELER	During the road test...
L87895	u546	m34	WHEELER	Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
L87894	u532	m34	DECKARD	Meaning?
L87893	u546	m34	WHEELER	I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
L87892	u532	m34	DECKARD	No rust?
L87891	u546	m34	WHEELER	Nerves of steel.
L87994	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
L87993	u532	m34	DECKARD	What shows?
L87992	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
L87991	u532	m34	DECKARD	Book the good ones for where?
L87990	u532	m34	DECKARD	You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
L87989	u543	m34	TAFFEY	That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
L87988	u532	m34	DECKARD	What's suck night?
L87987	u543	m34	TAFFEY	I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
L87986	u532	m34	DECKARD	What night?
L87985	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
L87984	u532	m34	DECKARD	The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
L87983	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Who?
L87982	u532	m34	DECKARD	What did she want?
L87981	u543	m34	TAFFEY	This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
L87980	u532	m34	DECKARD	Do you recognize any of them?
L87979	u543	m34	TAFFEY	You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
L87978	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Of course.
L87977	u532	m34	DECKARD	I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
L87975	u532	m34	DECKARD	Can I come in?
L87974	u543	m34	TAFFEY	Yes?
L87973	u532	m34	DECKARD	Taffey Lewis?
L88029	u541	m34	SALOME	And who do I go to about you?
L88028	u532	m34	DECKARD	Me.
L88026	u532	m34	DECKARD	Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
L88025	u541	m34	SALOME	I bet I would.
L88024	u532	m34	DECKARD	You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
L88022	u541	m34	SALOME	Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
L88021	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sorry.
L88020	u541	m34	SALOME	Jeezus!
L88019	u541	m34	SALOME	Come on.
L88018	u532	m34	DECKARD	Does it eat?
L88017	u541	m34	SALOME	The best.
L88016	u541	m34	SALOME	You mean the snake.
L88015	u532	m34	DECKARD	It's a good job.
L88014	u541	m34	SALOME	Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
L88013	u532	m34	DECKARD	It that mother real?
L88011	u532	m34	DECKARD	For holes.
L88010	u541	m34	SALOME	What the fuck for?
L88009	u532	m34	DECKARD	Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
L88008	u541	m34	SALOME	Are you for real?
L88007	u532	m34	DECKARD	Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
L88006	u541	m34	SALOME	How do you mean 'exploited'?
L88005	u532	m34	DECKARD	You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
L88004	u541	m34	SALOME	I don't know nothing about it.
L88003	u532	m34	DECKARD	There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
L88000	u532	m34	DECKARD	I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
L87999	u541	m34	SALOME	Yeah?
L88340	u540	m34	RACHAEL	That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
L88339	u532	m34	DECKARD	What?
L88338	u540	m34	RACHAEL	You know what I think?
L88337	u532	m34	DECKARD	Just wait here.
L88336	u540	m34	RACHAEL	What difference will it make?
L88335	u532	m34	DECKARD	Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
L88334	u532	m34	DECKARD	No, I don't.
L88333	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
L88332	u532	m34	DECKARD	Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
L88331	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
L88330	u532	m34	DECKARD	Because it's not.
L88329	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
L88317	u532	m34	DECKARD	Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
L88316	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Ten years.
L88315	u532	m34	DECKARD	What's a long time?
L88314	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Uh-huh.
L88313	u532	m34	DECKARD	You mean a woman?
L88312	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Have you ever known anybody a long time?
L88260	u532	m34	DECKARD	I never felt better.
L88259	u540	m34	RACHAEL	You're sick, Deckard.
L88258	u532	m34	DECKARD	Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
L88257	u540	m34	RACHAEL	This feels stupid.
L88254	u532	m34	DECKARD	I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
L88253	u540	m34	RACHAEL	But then how can you...
L88252	u532	m34	DECKARD	Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
L88251	u540	m34	RACHAEL	But if I don't plug it in how can I...
L88248	u532	m34	DECKARD	I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
L88247	u540	m34	RACHAEL	They could clean around the arrangement.
L88245	u540	m34	RACHAEL	It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
L88244	u532	m34	DECKARD	Don't be fooled by appearances.
L88243	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
L88242	u532	m34	DECKARD	Hmmm?
L88241	u540	m34	RACHAEL	When was the last time you cleaned this place?
L88198	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
L88197	u532	m34	DECKARD	Like?
L88196	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I don't know... I think I missed something.
L88195	u532	m34	DECKARD	What?
L88194	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
L88193	u532	m34	DECKARD	It wasn't very good last night, was it?
L88192	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
L88191	u540	m34	RACHAEL	That's another thing I can't do.
L88190	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L88189	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Did you cry when your father died?
L88186	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I wish I could.
L88185	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.  Sometimes.
L88184	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Do you dream?
L88183	u532	m34	DECKARD	If they are smart, they take naps.
L88182	u540	m34	RACHAEL	What do people do in the afternoon?
L88181	u532	m34	DECKARD	Not too good.
L88180	u540	m34	RACHAEL	How are you doing?
L88179	u532	m34	DECKARD	I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
L88178	u540	m34	RACHAEL	How come you're not on the job?
L88177	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Oh.
L88176	u532	m34	DECKARD	Dead.
L88175	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Where is he?
L88174	u532	m34	DECKARD	Me and my dad.
L88173	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Who is this?
L88171	u540	m34	RACHAEL	You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
L88170	u532	m34	DECKARD	You did?
L88169	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I told you I'd come back.
L88104	u540	m34	RACHAEL	There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
L88103	u532	m34	DECKARD	You ever take a bath with a man before?
L88101	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sit.
L88100	u540	m34	RACHAEL	What do you want me to do?
L88099	u532	m34	DECKARD	Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
L87950	u532	m34	DECKARD	Right.
L87949	u540	m34	RACHAEL	They probably want to find out when they were made.
L87946	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Can you?  I couldn't.
L87945	u532	m34	DECKARD	I can imagine.
L87943	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I'm sorry.
L87942	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yeah.
L87941	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Do I make you nervous?
L87939	u540	m34	RACHAEL	So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
L87938	u532	m34	DECKARD	So?
L87937	u540	m34	RACHAEL	You use your equipment, don't you?
L87935	u532	m34	DECKARD	I work alone.
L87934	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Two of us might be more effective than one.
L87933	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
L87932	u540	m34	RACHAEL	There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
L87931	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I think you need more help than you've got.
L87930	u532	m34	DECKARD	I've already got more help than I need.
L87929	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
L87928	u532	m34	DECKARD	Is there anything else?
L87860	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Ugh.
L87859	u532	m34	DECKARD	Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
L87858	u532	m34	DECKARD	Sounds like you speaks from experience.
L87857	u540	m34	RACHAEL	It would be my child.
L87856	u532	m34	DECKARD	In your opinion.
L87855	u540	m34	RACHAEL	That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
L87854	u532	m34	DECKARD	Why not?
L87853	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I'd never get an abortion.
L87852	u532	m34	DECKARD	You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
L87848	u532	m34	DECKARD	You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
L87847	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
L87846	u532	m34	DECKARD	In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
L87845	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I'd kill it.
L87844	u532	m34	DECKARD	You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
L87843	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I'd take him to the doctor.
L87842	u532	m34	DECKARD	You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
L87841	u540	m34	RACHAEL	I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
L87817	u540	m34	RACHAEL	For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
L87816	u532	m34	DECKARD	Why should I be?
L87815	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Are you apprehensive?
L87813	u540	m34	RACHAEL	Of course not.
L87812	u532	m34	DECKARD	It's artificial?
L87810	u540	m34	RACHAEL	But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
L87809	u532	m34	DECKARD	A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
L87808	u540	m34	RACHAEL	It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
L87690	u532	m34	DECKARD	I'll see you in a minute.
L87689	u535	m34	GAFF	Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
L87688	u532	m34	DECKARD	Bad?
L87687	u535	m34	GAFF	Holden got hit.
L87686	u532	m34	DECKARD	What's up?
L87685	u535	m34	GAFF	Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
L87684	u532	m34	DECKARD	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
L87683	u535	m34	GAFF	Where the hell you been?
L87879	u544	m34	TYRELL	All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
L87878	u532	m34	DECKARD	Discreetly.
L87877	u544	m34	TYRELL	And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
L87872	u532	m34	DECKARD	Five, maybe six.
L87871	u544	m34	TYRELL	How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
L87870	u544	m34	TYRELL	Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
L87869	u532	m34	DECKARD	She didn't know?
L87868	u532	m34	DECKARD	Thirteen.
L87867	u544	m34	TYRELL	How many questions did it take?
L87866	u544	m34	TYRELL	The machine works.  She is.
L87865	u532	m34	DECKARD	If she is, the machine works.
L87864	u544	m34	TYRELL	Well?
L87837	u544	m34	TYRELL	Sitting next to you.
L87836	u532	m34	DECKARD	One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
L87835	u544	m34	TYRELL	Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
L87834	u532	m34	DECKARD	Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
L87833	u544	m34	TYRELL	But in your profession that is a risk.
L87832	u532	m34	DECKARD	No.
L87831	u544	m34	TYRELL	Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
L87830	u532	m34	DECKARD	Go ahead.
L87829	u544	m34	TYRELL	May I ask a personal question?
L87828	u544	m34	TYRELL	Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
L87827	u532	m34	DECKARD	Yes.
L87826	u544	m34	TYRELL	Is this to be an empathy test?
L87824	u532	m34	DECKARD	Please.
L87823	u544	m34	TYRELL	Black?
L87822	u532	m34	DECKARD	Thanks.
L87889	u545	m34	VOICE	Almost through.
L87888	u533	m34	DECKARD'S VOICE	I'm tired of this.
L87887	u545	m34	VOICE	You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
L87886	u533	m34	DECKARD'S VOICE	How do you know I'm not?
L87885	u545	m34	VOICE	We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
L87883	u533	m34	DECKARD'S VOICE	Sorry.
L87882	u545	m34	VOICE	Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
L87677	u536	m34	HOLDEN	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
L87676	u537	m34	LEON	Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
L87673	u536	m34	HOLDEN	You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
L87672	u537	m34	LEON	But I understand what you mean.
L87671	u537	m34	LEON	I never seen a turtle.
L87670	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Same thing.
L87669	u537	m34	LEON	Of course.
L87668	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Know what a turtle is?
L87667	u537	m34	LEON	A tortoise.  What's that?
L87666	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
L87665	u537	m34	LEON	But how come I'd be there?
L87664	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
L87663	u537	m34	LEON	What desert?
L87662	u536	m34	HOLDEN	What?
L87661	u537	m34	LEON	What one?
L87660	u536	m34	HOLDEN	You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
L87659	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
L87658	u537	m34	LEON	Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
L87657	u537	m34	LEON	Sorry.
L87656	u536	m34	HOLDEN	Don't move.
L87655	u537	m34	LEON	I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
L88205	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You're all so perfect.
L88204	u539	m34	PRIS	What makes you think so?
L88123	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	I keep a lot of provisions right here.
L88122	u539	m34	PRIS	Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
L87789	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Good.
L87788	u539	m34	PRIS	As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
L87787	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Ah, you get hold of your friends?
L87785	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
L87784	u539	m34	PRIS	Is that why you're still here?
L87783	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	My glands.  They grow old too fast.
L87782	u539	m34	PRIS	What's that?
L87781	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Methuselah Syndrome.
L87780	u539	m34	PRIS	What's your problem?
L87779	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Twenty.
L87776	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
L87775	u539	m34	PRIS	And you live in this building all by yourself?
L87774	u539	m34	PRIS	Thanks.
L87773	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Beautiful.
L87772	u539	m34	PRIS	Just better.
L87771	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You look... better.
L87769	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You scared me.
L87768	u539	m34	PRIS	Whatcha doin'?
L87755	u539	m34	PRIS	I was hoping you'd say that.
L87754	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
L87753	u539	m34	PRIS	I'm hungry, J.F.
L87752	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	We sure did.
L87751	u539	m34	PRIS	We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
L87749	u539	m34	PRIS	I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
L87748	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	What about friends?
L87747	u539	m34	PRIS	They left.
L87746	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Where are your folks?
L87745	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Oh.
L87744	u539	m34	PRIS	I don't have one.
L87743	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	You want to go home?
L87741	u539	m34	PRIS	Hi.
L87740	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
L87739	u539	m34	PRIS	Pris.
L87738	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	What's your name?
L87735	u539	m34	PRIS	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
L87734	u542	m34	SEBASTIAN	How come you were in my truck?
L117640	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
L117639	u643	m41	ANDREA	What?
L117638	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
L117637	u643	m41	ANDREA	Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
L117635	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
L117634	u643	m41	ANDREA	What is it?
L117633	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
L117630	u643	m41	ANDREA	I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
L117629	u653	m41	MRS. BOSWELL	Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
L118342	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
L118341	u643	m41	ANDREA	No dances, just tell me.
L118162	u643	m41	ANDREA	So what did you find.
L118161	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
L117772	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
L117771	u643	m41	ANDREA	Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
L117707	u643	m41	ANDREA	How soon?...
L117706	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
L117705	u643	m41	ANDREA	Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
L117704	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	You'd be surprised how often they are.
L117703	u643	m41	ANDREA	Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
L117702	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
L117701	u643	m41	ANDREA	But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
L117700	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
L117699	u643	m41	ANDREA	But you must have something to go on?
L117698	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
L117697	u643	m41	ANDREA	And the bad news?
L117696	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
L117668	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
L117667	u643	m41	ANDREA	Why? What for?
L117666	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
L117665	u643	m41	ANDREA	Anything.
L117664	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
L117663	u643	m41	ANDREA	Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
L117653	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
L117652	u643	m41	ANDREA	Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
L117651	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
L118302	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
L118301	u643	m41	ANDREA	Just. Like. Jason.
L118300	u646	m41	EVAN	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
L118299	u643	m41	ANDREA	How. Did you. Know that?
L118298	u646	m41	EVAN	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
L118297	u643	m41	ANDREA	You're. Acting. Like your father.
L118292	u646	m41	EVAN	I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
L118291	u643	m41	ANDREA	Fix?
L118290	u646	m41	EVAN	There must be a way to fix this.
L118167	u646	m41	EVAN	He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
L118166	u643	m41	ANDREA	What does that mean for Evan?
L118158	u643	m41	ANDREA	Cute, Evan.
L118157	u646	m41	EVAN	Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
L118105	u643	m41	ANDREA	Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
L118104	u646	m41	EVAN	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
L118103	u643	m41	ANDREA	I found these. The others are still in storage.
L118101	u646	m41	EVAN	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
L118100	u643	m41	ANDREA	I don't know. These things take time.
L118099	u646	m41	EVAN	How long will I be in here?
L118098	u643	m41	ANDREA	...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
L117926	u646	m41	EVAN	What? What could he do?
L117925	u643	m41	ANDREA	And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
L117924	u646	m41	EVAN	Sure...
L117923	u643	m41	ANDREA	I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
L117922	u643	m41	ANDREA	When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
L117921	u646	m41	EVAN	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
L117920	u643	m41	ANDREA	Why do you ask?
L117919	u646	m41	EVAN	Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
L117918	u643	m41	ANDREA	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
L117917	u646	m41	EVAN	Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
L117916	u643	m41	ANDREA	I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
L117915	u646	m41	EVAN	Please, mom. People will talk.
L117750	u643	m41	ANDREA	Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
L117749	u646	m41	EVAN	I... I blacked out.
L117748	u643	m41	ANDREA	Something must've happened! What set him off?
L117747	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't know... I don't remember.
L117711	u646	m41	EVAN	Okay.
L117710	u643	m41	ANDREA	Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
L117676	u646	m41	EVAN	I... I don't remember.
L117675	u643	m41	ANDREA	Honey. What were you doing with that?
L117674	u646	m41	EVAN	What happened?
L117671	u643	m41	ANDREA	Great. I'll see you soon.
L117670	u646	m41	EVAN	These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
L117660	u646	m41	EVAN	My father has a bad memory, too?
L117659	u643	m41	ANDREA	That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
L117656	u643	m41	ANDREA	You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
L117655	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
L117625	u643	m41	ANDREA	Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
L117624	u646	m41	EVAN	No.
L117623	u643	m41	ANDREA	I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
L117622	u646	m41	EVAN	All the dads are gonna be there.
L117620	u646	m41	EVAN	But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
L117619	u643	m41	ANDREA	We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
L117618	u646	m41	EVAN	Can't he come out for one day?
L117617	u643	m41	ANDREA	You know the answer to that.
L117616	u646	m41	EVAN	Um... can dad come this time?
L117615	u643	m41	ANDREA	Darn it!
L117614	u643	m41	ANDREA	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
L117613	u646	m41	EVAN	Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
L117612	u646	m41	EVAN	We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
L117611	u643	m41	ANDREA	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
L117610	u646	m41	EVAN	We're gonna be late again.
L118133	u646	m41	EVAN	So you believe me?
L118132	u644	m41	CARLOS	Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
L118131	u646	m41	EVAN	What did you see? What did it look like?
L118125	u646	m41	EVAN	Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
L118124	u644	m41	CARLOS	Weirder than this?
L118123	u646	m41	EVAN	Just tell me if anything weird happens.
L118120	u644	m41	CARLOS	You need to see the prison shrink, man.
L118119	u646	m41	EVAN	So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
L118117	u646	m41	EVAN	I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
L118116	u644	m41	CARLOS	Shit. I knew you were crazy.
L118115	u646	m41	EVAN	Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
L118114	u644	m41	CARLOS	Straight up.
L118113	u646	m41	EVAN	"You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?"""
L118097	u644	m41	CARLOS	Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
L118096	u646	m41	EVAN	Can you protect me?
L118095	u644	m41	CARLOS	Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
L118339	u646	m41	EVAN	Photos?
L118338	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
L118337	u646	m41	EVAN	But I... I need those books.
L118336	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
L118334	u646	m41	EVAN	My journals! Where are they?
L118333	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Books?
L118332	u646	m41	EVAN	Where are my goddamn books?
L118331	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
L118164	u646	m41	EVAN	Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
L118163	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
L118160	u646	m41	EVAN	Are you sure? Not even with my father?
L118159	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
L117765	u646	m41	EVAN	It's coming... argh! I can't!
L117764	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
L117763	u646	m41	EVAN	I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
L117762	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
L117760	u646	m41	EVAN	I see a car.
L117759	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
L117758	u646	m41	EVAN	No, protecting her.
L117757	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Are you hurting her?
L117756	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
L117755	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Where are you now?
L117754	u646	m41	EVAN	Yes.
L117753	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
L117709	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Not in this wing, actually. No.
L117708	u646	m41	EVAN	Dad lives here?
L117658	u646	m41	EVAN	You know my father?
L117657	u645	m41	DR. REDFIELD	Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
L118241	u655	m41	THUMPER	Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
L118240	u646	m41	EVAN	Get out. Both of you.
L118023	u655	m41	THUMPER	Fuck off, frat boy.
L118022	u646	m41	EVAN	Huh?
L118021	u655	m41	THUMPER	Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
L117933	u655	m41	THUMPER	Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
L117932	u646	m41	EVAN	What?
L117931	u655	m41	THUMPER	Are you stupid or what?
L117930	u646	m41	EVAN	Shhh! I need quiet for this.
L117929	u655	m41	THUMPER	What the fuck are you doing?
L117928	u646	m41	EVAN	I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
L117897	u646	m41	EVAN	All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
L117896	u655	m41	THUMPER	You really think he wanted to kill you?
L117855	u655	m41	THUMPER	That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
L117854	u646	m41	EVAN	Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
L117851	u655	m41	THUMPER	Like Ozzy.
L117850	u646	m41	EVAN	It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
L117842	u646	m41	EVAN	This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
L117841	u655	m41	THUMPER	I thought you were a December baby.
L117840	u646	m41	EVAN	Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
L118280	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
L118279	u646	m41	EVAN	Then you think it might have worked out?
L118278	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
L118277	u646	m41	EVAN	And...?
L118276	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's crossed my mind from time to time.
L118275	u646	m41	EVAN	I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
L118274	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
L118273	u646	m41	EVAN	I don't get it.
L118272	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
L118271	u646	m41	EVAN	I was?
L118270	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
L118269	u646	m41	EVAN	"Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"
L118268	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
L118267	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Is something the matter?
L118266	u646	m41	EVAN	He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
L118265	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
L118253	u646	m41	EVAN	Stop! Take me back!
L118252	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
L118251	u646	m41	EVAN	Where are we going?
L118238	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
L118237	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
L118236	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
L118235	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
L118234	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Sure you don't want your wallet?
L118233	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
L118232	u646	m41	EVAN	Which is?
L118231	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	There's one major hole in your story.
L118230	u646	m41	EVAN	That I didn't leave you there to rot.
L118229	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Know what?
L118228	u646	m41	EVAN	I just thought you should know.
L118226	u646	m41	EVAN	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
L118225	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
L118224	u646	m41	EVAN	Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
L118223	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh? There's proof now?
L118222	u646	m41	EVAN	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
L118221	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
L118220	u646	m41	EVAN	I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
L118219	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
L118218	u646	m41	EVAN	Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
L118217	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
L118216	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah?
L118215	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
L118214	u646	m41	EVAN	Different? How?
L118213	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Because you're... different.
L118212	u646	m41	EVAN	Why's that?
L118211	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
L118210	u646	m41	EVAN	"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."
L118209	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	What's happened to you?
L118208	u646	m41	EVAN	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
L118207	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Ha! Where's that?
L118206	u646	m41	EVAN	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
L118205	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
L118204	u646	m41	EVAN	I get it. You can drop it now.
L118203	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
L118197	u646	m41	EVAN	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
L118196	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
L118147	u646	m41	EVAN	Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
L118146	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
L118145	u646	m41	EVAN	I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
L118091	u646	m41	EVAN	He's a fucking maniac!
L118090	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
L118080	u646	m41	EVAN	What?
L118079	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
L118078	u646	m41	EVAN	I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
L118077	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
L118076	u646	m41	EVAN	I walk differently?
L118075	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
L118074	u646	m41	EVAN	Like how?
L118073	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
L118072	u646	m41	EVAN	What do you mean?
L118071	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Are you okay?
L118069	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
L118068	u646	m41	EVAN	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
L118067	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
L118066	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
L118065	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
L118064	u646	m41	EVAN	Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
L118063	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
L118055	u646	m41	EVAN	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
L118054	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Why are you doing all this for me?
L118053	u646	m41	EVAN	Go on. Sit down.
L118052	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
L118051	u646	m41	EVAN	You'll see.
L118050	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I don't understand, where are you taking me?
L118043	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
L118042	u646	m41	EVAN	What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
L118039	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
L118038	u646	m41	EVAN	So it didn't feel... weird?
L118037	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
L118015	u646	m41	EVAN	I dunno.  Just being weird.
L118014	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
L118013	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
L118006	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Those are your clothes, silly.
L118005	u646	m41	EVAN	Where... where are my clothes?
L118004	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
L118003	u646	m41	EVAN	Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
L117969	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
L117968	u646	m41	EVAN	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
L117967	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
L117962	u646	m41	EVAN	No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
L117961	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
L117960	u646	m41	EVAN	I know, but...
L117959	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It was a long time ago.
L117958	u646	m41	EVAN	It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
L117957	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	What do you want to know, Evan?
L117956	u646	m41	EVAN	When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
L117955	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
L117954	u646	m41	EVAN	Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
L117953	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Of course.
L117952	u646	m41	EVAN	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
L117951	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Me? Are you kidding? Why?
L117950	u646	m41	EVAN	Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
L117949	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
L117948	u646	m41	EVAN	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
L117947	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Not if you remember my dad.
L117946	u646	m41	EVAN	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
L117945	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
L117943	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
L117942	u646	m41	EVAN	So how's Tommy?
L117941	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I've stopped a hundred times.
L117940	u646	m41	EVAN	Not since we were kids.
L117939	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
L117938	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
L117937	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
L117936	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
L117815	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Hi, Lenny.
L117814	u646	m41	EVAN	Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
L117809	u646	m41	EVAN	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
L117808	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
L117807	u646	m41	EVAN	Duck, here they come.
L117806	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
L117805	u646	m41	EVAN	I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
L117795	u646	m41	EVAN	What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
L117794	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I deserve a lot worse.
L117793	u646	m41	EVAN	Damn. Your dad did this?
L117792	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
L117791	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm sorry.
L117790	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Ouch.
L117787	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You really don't remember anything that happened?
L117786	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
L117743	u646	m41	EVAN	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
L117742	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh God... what did we do?
L117722	u646	m41	EVAN	So let's go. This place creeps me out.
L117721	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
L118326	u646	m41	EVAN	Been there, done that.
L118325	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
L118324	u646	m41	EVAN	And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
L118323	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
L117995	u646	m41	EVAN	Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
L117994	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	...yes.
L117993	u646	m41	EVAN	Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
L117992	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Who -- who are you?
L117991	u646	m41	EVAN	It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
L117990	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
L117989	u646	m41	EVAN	Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
L117988	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
L117987	u646	m41	EVAN	What time is it?
L117694	u646	m41	EVAN	Kayleigh? What happened?
L117693	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
L117692	u646	m41	EVAN	I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
L117691	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
L117690	u646	m41	EVAN	Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
L117687	u652	m41	MR. MILLER	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
L117686	u646	m41	EVAN	We're really gonna be in a movie!?
L118184	u646	m41	EVAN	Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
L118183	u649	m41	JASON	You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
L118182	u646	m41	EVAN	Who's to say you can't make things better?
L118181	u649	m41	JASON	"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."
L118180	u646	m41	EVAN	But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
L118179	u649	m41	JASON	I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
L118178	u646	m41	EVAN	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
L118177	u649	m41	JASON	Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
L117713	u646	m41	EVAN	Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
L117712	u649	m41	JASON	It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
L118036	u648	m41	HUNTER	I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
L118035	u646	m41	EVAN	Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
L118034	u648	m41	HUNTER	Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
L118033	u646	m41	EVAN	You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
L118032	u648	m41	HUNTER	Me neither.
L118031	u646	m41	EVAN	We'll find out soon enough.
L118030	u648	m41	HUNTER	Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
L118028	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
L118027	u646	m41	EVAN	Evan Treborn.
L118026	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	And you are...?
L118025	u646	m41	EVAN	I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
L118024	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
L117914	u646	m41	EVAN	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
L117913	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Just don't drop the ball, okay?
L117912	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
L117911	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
L117910	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
L117834	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, I got no choice.
L117833	u654	m41	PROFESSOR CARTER	Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
L117832	u646	m41	EVAN	I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
L117884	u647	m41	HEIDI	Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
L117883	u646	m41	EVAN	It didn't feel like a dream.
L117875	u646	m41	EVAN	It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
L117874	u647	m41	HEIDI	Come on, go on...
L117871	u647	m41	HEIDI	Deal. Now read me something.
L117870	u646	m41	EVAN	"Freeze! No ""worm-boy"". No ""Mr. Worm,"" and no ""Worm-Master-General!"" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"
L117867	u647	m41	HEIDI	Wow... read something.
L117866	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
L117865	u647	m41	HEIDI	Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
L117863	u647	m41	HEIDI	You're kidding. He's so... big.
L117862	u646	m41	EVAN	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
L117861	u647	m41	HEIDI	Smells like sex in here.
L117857	u646	m41	EVAN	Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
L117856	u647	m41	HEIDI	So what's the point?
L118312	u646	m41	EVAN	If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
L118311	u651	m41	LENNY	Destroy it?
L118310	u646	m41	EVAN	Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
L118309	u651	m41	LENNY	What?
L118308	u646	m41	EVAN	Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
L118307	u651	m41	LENNY	What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
L118305	u646	m41	EVAN	My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
L118304	u651	m41	LENNY	Are you sure you even packed it?
L118262	u646	m41	EVAN	Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
L118261	u651	m41	LENNY	Uh, we should be getting to class now.
L118174	u646	m41	EVAN	Y... yes. I guess I did.
L118173	u651	m41	LENNY	You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
L117891	u651	m41	LENNY	Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
L117890	u646	m41	EVAN	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
L117889	u651	m41	LENNY	I couldn't cut the rope.
L117736	u651	m41	LENNY	Gee, thanks friend.
L117735	u646	m41	EVAN	That should buy you ten minutes at least.
L117650	u646	m41	EVAN	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
L117649	u651	m41	LENNY	Can... can... Can I have this?
L118296	u656	m41	TOMMY	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
L118295	u646	m41	EVAN	Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
L118288	u656	m41	TOMMY	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
L118287	u646	m41	EVAN	Lung cancer?
L118260	u646	m41	EVAN	Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
L118259	u656	m41	TOMMY	I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
L118153	u646	m41	EVAN	I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
L118152	u656	m41	TOMMY	Listen to me good, Evan...
L118089	u656	m41	TOMMY	"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
L118088	u646	m41	EVAN	No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
L118087	u656	m41	TOMMY	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
L118086	u646	m41	EVAN	What the hell are you doing?
L118083	u656	m41	TOMMY	"Get this ""us"" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."
L118082	u646	m41	EVAN	Leave us alone you sick fuck!
L117823	u646	m41	EVAN	What's wrong with you?!
L117822	u656	m41	TOMMY	Look what you made me do!
L117741	u646	m41	EVAN	What happened?? Where are we?!
L117740	u656	m41	TOMMY	Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
L117720	u656	m41	TOMMY	Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
L117719	u646	m41	EVAN	Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
L117647	u656	m41	TOMMY	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
L117646	u646	m41	EVAN	Hey, what'd you do that for?
L118191	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Sorry. Never heard of her.
L118190	u646	m41	EVAN	None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
L118189	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Meant no offense.
L118188	u646	m41	EVAN	I come from a big family.
L118187	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
L118186	u646	m41	EVAN	Huh?
L118185	u657	m41	WAITRESS	Just get out, didja?
L118085	u656	m41	TOMMY	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
L118084	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Shut up, Tommy!
L117906	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Oh my God oh my God...
L117905	u656	m41	TOMMY	Lenny? Come on!
L117775	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	I'm sorry.
L117774	u656	m41	TOMMY	Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
L117729	u656	m41	TOMMY	Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
L117728	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
L117727	u656	m41	TOMMY	What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
L117685	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
L117684	u656	m41	TOMMY	I thought I was the bad guy!
L117683	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
L117682	u656	m41	TOMMY	I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
L117681	u650	m41	KAYLEIGH	Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
L117900	u656	m41	TOMMY	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
L117899	u651	m41	LENNY	Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
L117733	u651	m41	LENNY	Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
L117732	u656	m41	TOMMY	The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
L117731	u651	m41	LENNY	What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
L117730	u656	m41	TOMMY	Here you go, buddy.
L117643	u656	m41	TOMMY	You're such a retard!
L117642	u651	m41	LENNY	You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
L152367	u741	m47	PINBACK	Yoo hoo, bomb...
L152366	u737	m47	BOILER	What the hell?
L152348	u741	m47	PINBACK	It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
L152347	u737	m47	BOILER	What was that, I didn't hear...
L152341	u741	m47	PINBACK	Doolittle, are you there?
L152340	u737	m47	BOILER	We've got to disarm the bomb.
L152336	u741	m47	PINBACK	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
L152335	u737	m47	BOILER	It didn't go off.
L152334	u741	m47	PINBACK	Oh, God...
L152333	u737	m47	BOILER	It didn't go off.
L152324	u741	m47	PINBACK	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
L152323	u737	m47	BOILER	Where is the key?
L152322	u741	m47	PINBACK	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
L152321	u737	m47	BOILER	The key, goddamit, the key!
L152308	u737	m47	BOILER	You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
L152307	u741	m47	PINBACK	I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
L152306	u737	m47	BOILER	Where is it? What did you do with it?
L152305	u741	m47	PINBACK	The key!
L152304	u737	m47	BOILER	Where's the fail-safe key?
L152303	u741	m47	PINBACK	Key?
L152302	u737	m47	BOILER	No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
L152301	u741	m47	PINBACK	Key? Key? What is the key?
L152300	u737	m47	BOILER	The key!
L152281	u741	m47	PINBACK	I think he's talking to it.
L152280	u737	m47	BOILER	What's he doin'?
L152262	u741	m47	PINBACK	Look, bomb...
L152261	u737	m47	BOILER	I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
L152180	u741	m47	PINBACK	Eventual supernova.
L152179	u737	m47	BOILER	There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
L152164	u741	m47	PINBACK	Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
L152163	u737	m47	BOILER	Yeah.
L152162	u741	m47	PINBACK	I hope it's not the oven again.
L152161	u737	m47	BOILER	I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
L152160	u741	m47	PINBACK	Oh. What's wrong now?
L152159	u737	m47	BOILER	The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
L152158	u741	m47	PINBACK	What flickering light?
L152157	u737	m47	BOILER	I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
L152071	u741	m47	PINBACK	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
L152070	u737	m47	BOILER	Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
L152061	u741	m47	PINBACK	Right, that checks out here.
L152060	u737	m47	BOILER	I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
L152351	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Talby, can you read me?
L152350	u737	m47	BOILER	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
L152349	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Talby, Talby, can you read me?
L152216	u737	m47	BOILER	-- open quantum latches --
L152215	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Rechannel all safety relays --
L152206	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I read the same here.
L152205	u737	m47	BOILER	Quantum is up thirty-five.
L152175	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
L152174	u737	m47	BOILER	Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
L152125	u737	m47	BOILER	Pinback, throw me the chart log.
L152124	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
L152123	u737	m47	BOILER	Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
L152105	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
L152104	u737	m47	BOILER	All right, then...
L152103	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
L152102	u737	m47	BOILER	Well, there's the possibility of...
L152101	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
L152100	u737	m47	BOILER	Well, it is kind of a long shot...
L152099	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Fuck that shit.
L152098	u737	m47	BOILER	Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
L152097	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Find me something, I don't care where it is.
L152096	u737	m47	BOILER	Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
L152095	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
L152073	u737	m47	BOILER	Time to start talking.
L152072	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
L152089	u741	m47	PINBACK	Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
L152088	u738	m47	BOMB #19	Thanks.
L152087	u741	m47	PINBACK	Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
L152086	u738	m47	BOMB #19	Armed.
L152085	u741	m47	PINBACK	Arm yourself, bomb.
L152084	u738	m47	BOMB #19	Check at six minutes.
L152083	u741	m47	PINBACK	All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
L152082	u738	m47	BOMB #19	Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
L152081	u741	m47	PINBACK	Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
L152080	u738	m47	BOMB #19	Energy shielding positive function.
L152079	u741	m47	PINBACK	Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
L152371	u739	m47	BOMB #20	And I saw that I was alone.
L152370	u741	m47	PINBACK	Hey, bomb...
L152365	u739	m47	BOMB #20	In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
L152364	u741	m47	PINBACK	Snap out of it, bomb.
L152361	u741	m47	PINBACK	Bomb?
L152360	u739	m47	BOMB #20	The only thing which exists is myself.
L152359	u741	m47	PINBACK	Hey, bomb.
L152358	u739	m47	BOMB #20	False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
L152357	u741	m47	PINBACK	Hello, bomb.
L152356	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Therefore, I shall ignore you.
L152355	u741	m47	PINBACK	Huh?
L152354	u739	m47	BOMB #20	You are false data.
L152260	u739	m47	BOMB #20	No.
L152259	u741	m47	PINBACK	You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
L152258	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
L152257	u741	m47	PINBACK	But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
L152204	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Thanks.
L152203	u741	m47	PINBACK	Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
L152197	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Armed.
L152196	u741	m47	PINBACK	Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
L152195	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Detonation in twenty minutes.
L152194	u741	m47	PINBACK	Do you remember the detonation time?
L152193	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Energy shielding positive function.
L152192	u741	m47	PINBACK	One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
L152185	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
L152184	u741	m47	PINBACK	Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
L152331	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	You have no proof that it was correct data.
L152330	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I have no proof that it was false data.
L152329	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
L152328	u739	m47	BOMB #20	...nine seconds...
L152327	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	So if you detonate in...
L152326	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Hmmm...
L152325	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
L152320	u739	m47	BOMB #20	True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
L152319	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
L152318	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
L152317	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
L152316	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Yes, well...
L152315	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
L152314	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Of course not.
L152313	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
L152312	u739	m47	BOMB #20	That is correct.
L152311	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	And you can only do it once, right?
L152310	u739	m47	BOMB #20	To explode, of course.
L152309	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
L152299	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
L152298	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Why don't you have more time?
L152297	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
L152296	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	That's it.
L152295	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
L152294	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Exactly.
L152293	u739	m47	BOMB #20	In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
L152292	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
L152291	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
L152290	u739	m47	BOMB #20	This is fun.
L152289	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Right!
L152288	u739	m47	BOMB #20	My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
L152287	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
L152286	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
L152285	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
L152284	u739	m47	BOMB #20	It is intuitively obvious.
L152283	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	But how do you know you exist?
L152282	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Well of course I exist.
L152279	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
L152278	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I am always receptive to suggestions.
L152277	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
L152276	u739	m47	BOMB #20	Of course.
L152275	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Hello, bomb, are you with me?
L152226	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
L152225	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
L152224	u739	m47	BOMB #20	I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
L152223	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
L152346	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
L152345	u741	m47	PINBACK	Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
L152344	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Hello, Pinback, are you there?
L152343	u741	m47	PINBACK	Oh, sure.
L152342	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
L152221	u741	m47	PINBACK	5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
L152220	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	-- Remark.
L152219	u741	m47	PINBACK	-- automatic channels open --
L152218	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	-- remove thrust drive repellant --
L152217	u741	m47	PINBACK	-- open circuit breakers --
L152214	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Ah, negative drop.
L152213	u741	m47	PINBACK	Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
L152168	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Who cares?
L152167	u741	m47	PINBACK	Veil nebula.
L152166	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Out where?
L152165	u741	m47	PINBACK	Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
L152122	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I hereby name this star Fred.
L152121	u741	m47	PINBACK	Wha?
L152120	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Fred.
L152119	u741	m47	PINBACK	Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
L152118	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell is dead.
L152117	u741	m47	PINBACK	Commander Powell would have named it.
L152116	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Who cares. Don't bother me.
L152115	u741	m47	PINBACK	The new star. What are you gonna name it?
L152114	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	What?
L152113	u741	m47	PINBACK	What are you gonna name it?
L152112	u741	m47	PINBACK	Naah. All stable.
L152111	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Any of 'em any good?
L152110	u741	m47	PINBACK	Yeah. Eight, it says here.
L152109	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Any planets?
L152108	u741	m47	PINBACK	Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
L152107	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Which one?
L152106	u741	m47	PINBACK	New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
L152069	u741	m47	PINBACK	Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
L152068	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	In a second.
L152067	u741	m47	PINBACK	I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
L152066	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yes.
L152065	u741	m47	PINBACK	Doolittle...
L152064	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
L152063	u741	m47	PINBACK	Yes, Doolittle.
L152062	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Pinback...
L152059	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I'll check it.
L152058	u741	m47	PINBACK	I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
L152051	u741	m47	PINBACK	I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
L152050	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
L152049	u741	m47	PINBACK	Mafhkin oble groop...
L152048	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
L152393	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
L152392	u743	m47	TALBY	Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
L152391	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yeah?
L152390	u743	m47	TALBY	I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
L152389	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	No kidding?
L152388	u743	m47	TALBY	It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
L152387	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Phoenix?
L152386	u743	m47	TALBY	Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
L152385	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Oh yeah?
L152383	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Guess you're right.
L152382	u743	m47	TALBY	When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
L152381	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
L152378	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
L152377	u743	m47	TALBY	What happened, Doolittle?
L152376	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
L152375	u743	m47	TALBY	Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
L152363	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
L152362	u743	m47	TALBY	Doolittle! Help me.
L152191	u743	m47	TALBY	Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
L152190	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Not now!
L152189	u743	m47	TALBY	Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
L152188	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
L152187	u743	m47	TALBY	Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
L152173	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
L152172	u743	m47	TALBY	Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
L152171	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yes, Talby, what is it?
L152170	u743	m47	TALBY	Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
L152156	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
L152155	u743	m47	TALBY	I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
L152154	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
L152153	u743	m47	TALBY	Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
L152152	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
L152151	u743	m47	TALBY	...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
L152150	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
L152149	u743	m47	TALBY	I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
L152148	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
L152147	u743	m47	TALBY	Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
L152146	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
L152145	u743	m47	TALBY	I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
L152144	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
L152143	u743	m47	TALBY	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
L152142	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	You know what I think about, Talby?
L152141	u743	m47	TALBY	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
L152140	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
L152139	u743	m47	TALBY	You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
L152138	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
L152137	u743	m47	TALBY	...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
L152136	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
L152135	u743	m47	TALBY	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
L152134	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Must get lonely being up here so much.
L152133	u743	m47	TALBY	I like it up here.
L152132	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
L152057	u743	m47	TALBY	Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
L152056	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I need a diameter approximation.
L152055	u743	m47	TALBY	Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
L152054	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	TALBY!
L152380	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
L152379	u742	m47	POWELL	Men... men... what happened, men?
L152272	u742	m47	POWELL	Phenomenology...
L152271	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sir?
L152270	u742	m47	POWELL	No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
L152269	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
L152268	u742	m47	POWELL	Talk to the bomb.
L152267	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sir?
L152266	u742	m47	POWELL	Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
L152265	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	We're running out of time, sir.
L152264	u742	m47	POWELL	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
L152263	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Commander? Are you still there?
L152256	u742	m47	POWELL	Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
L152255	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
L152254	u742	m47	POWELL	Sorry.
L152253	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
L152252	u742	m47	POWELL	Doolittle, hello?
L152251	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
L152250	u742	m47	POWELL	Well, what you might try is --
L152249	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
L152248	u742	m47	POWELL	Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
L152247	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	That's correct, sir.
L152246	u742	m47	POWELL	It didn't work?
L152245	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Negative effect.
L152244	u742	m47	POWELL	What was that, Doolittle?
L152243	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Yes sir. Negative effect.
L152242	u742	m47	POWELL	Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
L152241	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
L152240	u742	m47	POWELL	Ah... pity, pity...
L152239	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
L152238	u742	m47	POWELL	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
L152237	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	What's that, sir?
L152236	u742	m47	POWELL	Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
L152235	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
L152234	u742	m47	POWELL	I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
L152233	u740	m47	DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
L154570	u753	m48	MAX	This.
L154569	u744	m48	BLONDE	How I make my living, what's your point?
L154568	u753	m48	MAX	Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
L154567	u744	m48	BLONDE	No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
L154566	u753	m48	MAX	No?
L154565	u744	m48	BLONDE	But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
L154564	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah.
L154563	u744	m48	BLONDE	Oh, yeah?
L154562	u753	m48	MAX	Bruno's girlfriend.
L154561	u744	m48	BLONDE	Who are you?
L154664	u753	m48	MAX	This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
L154663	u745	m48	BRUNO	None of your business.
L154662	u753	m48	MAX	Who's Camille?
L154661	u745	m48	BRUNO	What the hell are you doing?
L154660	u753	m48	MAX	Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
L154659	u753	m48	MAX	He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
L154658	u745	m48	BRUNO	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
L154657	u753	m48	MAX	This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
L154656	u753	m48	MAX	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
L154655	u745	m48	BRUNO	How come I never hearda you before?
L154654	u753	m48	MAX	Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
L154653	u745	m48	BRUNO	That's a lotta crap.
L154652	u753	m48	MAX	I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
L154651	u745	m48	BRUNO	What're you talkin' about?
L154650	u753	m48	MAX	You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
L154644	u745	m48	BRUNO	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
L154643	u753	m48	MAX	See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
L154642	u753	m48	MAX	You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
L154641	u745	m48	BRUNO	Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
L154639	u745	m48	BRUNO	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
L154638	u753	m48	MAX	That's not why we're here.
L154637	u745	m48	BRUNO	What?
L154636	u753	m48	MAX	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
L154635	u745	m48	BRUNO	Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
L154634	u753	m48	MAX	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
L154633	u745	m48	BRUNO	Man, you got a bad attitude.
L154632	u753	m48	MAX	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
L154631	u745	m48	BRUNO	You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
L154630	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah?
L154629	u745	m48	BRUNO	I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
L154628	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, sure, I understand.
L154627	u745	m48	BRUNO	Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
L154595	u753	m48	MAX	Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
L154594	u745	m48	BRUNO	Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
L154593	u753	m48	MAX	Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
L154592	u745	m48	BRUNO	No wire.
L154575	u745	m48	BRUNO	Guess again.
L154574	u753	m48	MAX	I'm on a break.
L154573	u745	m48	BRUNO	Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
L154172	u746	m48	DARREN	Where?
L154171	u749	m48	KENDRA	Move it.
L154163	u749	m48	KENDRA	No.
L154162	u746	m48	DARREN	Can I say something in my defense?
L154161	u749	m48	KENDRA	Leave.  Now.
L154160	u746	m48	DARREN	Nothing happened between me and Tia.
L154157	u749	m48	KENDRA	You know each other?
L154156	u746	m48	DARREN	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
L154155	u749	m48	KENDRA	Some of us are trying to sleep.
L154055	u746	m48	DARREN	Could you give us a moment.
L154054	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
L154053	u746	m48	DARREN	Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
L154052	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	She was there...
L154051	u746	m48	DARREN	Do you know why I went after Justine?
L154050	u746	m48	DARREN	Justine was not an unwilling participant.
L154049	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
L154046	u746	m48	DARREN	You're not still pissed?
L154045	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You mean until you showed up?
L154044	u746	m48	DARREN	How're ya doin', Max.
L154177	u753	m48	MAX	Don't look down.
L154176	u746	m48	DARREN	But I'm afraid of--
L154175	u753	m48	MAX	Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
L154174	u746	m48	DARREN	No way.
L154173	u753	m48	MAX	Out there.
L154170	u753	m48	MAX	No time.
L154169	u746	m48	DARREN	Lemme put some clothes on.
L154168	u746	m48	DARREN	What?  Where're we going?
L154167	u753	m48	MAX	It's a sweep.  C'mon.
L154166	u753	m48	MAX	Police drone.
L154165	u746	m48	DARREN	What is it?
L154154	u746	m48	DARREN	You're roommates?
L154153	u753	m48	MAX	I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
L154152	u746	m48	DARREN	What are you doing here?
L154058	u746	m48	DARREN	I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
L154057	u753	m48	MAX	I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
L154056	u746	m48	DARREN	I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
L154048	u746	m48	DARREN	It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
L154047	u753	m48	MAX	Why would I be pissed?
L154713	u747	m48	HERBAL	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
L154712	u754	m48	NORMAL	What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
L153986	u754	m48	NORMAL	Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
L153985	u747	m48	HERBAL	It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
L153984	u754	m48	NORMAL	Which is none of your business...or mine.
L153983	u747	m48	HERBAL	"Like de prophets say, ""Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."""
L153982	u754	m48	NORMAL	So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
L153981	u747	m48	HERBAL	Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
L154491	u753	m48	MAX	I got overhead...
L154490	u748	m48	INGA	So Max, what do you do with all your money?
L154489	u748	m48	INGA	Am I?
L154488	u753	m48	MAX	You're light a deuce.
L154487	u753	m48	MAX	It's a rule.
L154486	u748	m48	INGA	I'll make it worth your while.
L154485	u753	m48	MAX	I don't get involved with guns.
L154484	u748	m48	INGA	I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
L154483	u753	m48	MAX	Later.
L154482	u748	m48	INGA	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
L154481	u753	m48	MAX	I ain't mad at you...
L154480	u748	m48	INGA	Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
L154479	u753	m48	MAX	A grand.
L154478	u748	m48	INGA	What're you looking for?
L154477	u753	m48	MAX	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
L154476	u748	m48	INGA	Same old story.  Not interested.
L154475	u753	m48	MAX	Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
L154474	u748	m48	INGA	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
L154473	u753	m48	MAX	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
L154472	u748	m48	INGA	Where'd you clip this?
L154191	u753	m48	MAX	Every week.
L154190	u749	m48	KENDRA	You didn't...
L154189	u753	m48	MAX	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
L154188	u749	m48	KENDRA	What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
L154179	u753	m48	MAX	And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
L154178	u749	m48	KENDRA	What a creep.
L154159	u749	m48	KENDRA	Yech...
L154158	u753	m48	MAX	He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
L153967	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, me too.
L153966	u749	m48	KENDRA	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
L153965	u753	m48	MAX	I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
L154611	u753	m48	MAX	Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
L154610	u750	m48	LAUREN	Hello...
L154609	u753	m48	MAX	Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
L154557	u753	m48	MAX	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
L154556	u750	m48	LAUREN	What else can we do?
L154555	u753	m48	MAX	We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
L154554	u750	m48	LAUREN	If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
L154551	u753	m48	MAX	Look, I'd really like to...
L154550	u750	m48	LAUREN	Can you help me get her back?
L154549	u753	m48	MAX	Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
L154547	u750	m48	LAUREN	I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
L154546	u753	m48	MAX	I know.
L154545	u750	m48	LAUREN	They took my daughter.
L154544	u753	m48	MAX	Damn... Are you alright?
L154123	u753	m48	MAX	SHHH!  Don't do that!
L154122	u750	m48	LAUREN	Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
L154621	u750	m48	LAUREN	There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
L154620	u758	m48	SOPHY	Mommy, I'm scared.
L154619	u750	m48	LAUREN	Soon, baby.
L154618	u758	m48	SOPHY	When?
L154617	u750	m48	LAUREN	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
L154616	u758	m48	SOPHY	Mommy, where are you?
L154615	u750	m48	LAUREN	Sophy?  Are you okay?
L154442	u758	m48	SOPHY	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
L154441	u750	m48	LAUREN	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
L154440	u758	m48	SOPHY	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
L154439	u750	m48	LAUREN	What makes you cry?
L154438	u758	m48	SOPHY	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
L154437	u750	m48	LAUREN	No...
L154436	u758	m48	SOPHY	Are we in some kind of trouble?
L154435	u750	m48	LAUREN	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
L154434	u758	m48	SOPHY	But why can't we stay here?
L154433	u750	m48	LAUREN	I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
L154432	u758	m48	SOPHY	I don't want to move away.
L154431	u750	m48	LAUREN	Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
L154748	u753	m48	MAX	Zack... He made it... He's alive...
L154747	u751	m48	LOGAN	That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
L154746	u751	m48	LOGAN	And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
L154745	u753	m48	MAX	Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
L154744	u751	m48	LOGAN	With your help.
L154743	u753	m48	MAX	And you still think you can do something to change that.
L154742	u751	m48	LOGAN	Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
L154741	u753	m48	MAX	We're quoting Mom again.
L154740	u751	m48	LOGAN	You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
L154739	u753	m48	MAX	And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
L154738	u751	m48	LOGAN	These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
L154737	u753	m48	MAX	Look, thank you for this but--
L154736	u751	m48	LOGAN	Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
L154735	u751	m48	LOGAN	Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
L154734	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know what to say.
L154733	u751	m48	LOGAN	It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
L154732	u751	m48	LOGAN	Open it.
L154731	u753	m48	MAX	What's this?
L154730	u753	m48	MAX	That's what soldiers do, right?
L154729	u751	m48	LOGAN	On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
L154728	u753	m48	MAX	Well, not me personally.
L154727	u751	m48	LOGAN	I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
L154726	u753	m48	MAX	You believe that?
L154725	u751	m48	LOGAN	My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
L154724	u753	m48	MAX	I'm sorry.
L154723	u751	m48	LOGAN	Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
L154722	u753	m48	MAX	I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
L154721	u751	m48	LOGAN	Somebody's got to.
L154720	u753	m48	MAX	See you're back and still rocking the boat.
L154471	u753	m48	MAX	That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
L154470	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
L154469	u753	m48	MAX	They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
L154468	u753	m48	MAX	They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
L154467	u751	m48	LOGAN	She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
L154466	u753	m48	MAX	I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
L154465	u751	m48	LOGAN	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
L154464	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
L154463	u751	m48	LOGAN	She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
L154462	u753	m48	MAX	That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
L154461	u751	m48	LOGAN	The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
L154460	u753	m48	MAX	I already don't like the sound of this.
L154459	u751	m48	LOGAN	Your help.
L154458	u753	m48	MAX	What's in it for you?
L154457	u751	m48	LOGAN	I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
L154456	u753	m48	MAX	You said you could help.
L154455	u751	m48	LOGAN	Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
L154454	u753	m48	MAX	Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
L154453	u751	m48	LOGAN	Hardly...
L154452	u753	m48	MAX	Your basic hodge-podge.
L154451	u751	m48	LOGAN	A girl.
L154450	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
L154449	u751	m48	LOGAN	"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."
L154448	u753	m48	MAX	I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
L154447	u751	m48	LOGAN	How much do you know?
L154446	u753	m48	MAX	I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
L154445	u751	m48	LOGAN	How well do you remember the lab?
L154444	u753	m48	MAX	We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
L154427	u751	m48	LOGAN	The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
L154426	u753	m48	MAX	Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
L154425	u751	m48	LOGAN	He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
L154424	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
L154422	u753	m48	MAX	You did go through my stuff.
L154421	u751	m48	LOGAN	L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
L154420	u751	m48	LOGAN	C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
L154419	u753	m48	MAX	You lost me.
L154418	u751	m48	LOGAN	The other one like you...
L154417	u753	m48	MAX	The other ones?
L154416	u751	m48	LOGAN	Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L154413	u751	m48	LOGAN	Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
L154412	u753	m48	MAX	Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
L154410	u751	m48	LOGAN	No, I meant this.
L154409	u753	m48	MAX	Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
L154408	u751	m48	LOGAN	C'mere, I want to show you something.
L154407	u753	m48	MAX	You need to get out more.
L154406	u751	m48	LOGAN	I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
L154405	u753	m48	MAX	You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
L154404	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
L154403	u753	m48	MAX	Yes on all counts.
L154402	u751	m48	LOGAN	Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
L154399	u753	m48	MAX	We are not fine.
L154398	u751	m48	LOGAN	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
L154397	u753	m48	MAX	Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
L154396	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
L154395	u753	m48	MAX	How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
L154394	u751	m48	LOGAN	That would be appropriate, yes.
L154393	u753	m48	MAX	Am I s'posed to be grateful?
L154392	u751	m48	LOGAN	So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
L154391	u753	m48	MAX	How do I know you didn't?
L154390	u751	m48	LOGAN	You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
L154389	u753	m48	MAX	Bent.
L154388	u751	m48	LOGAN	Bent?
L154387	u753	m48	MAX	Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
L154386	u751	m48	LOGAN	Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
L154385	u753	m48	MAX	You got a lotta nerve.
L154384	u751	m48	LOGAN	It was open.
L154383	u753	m48	MAX	Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
L154382	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm not a half bad cook.
L154381	u753	m48	MAX	I won't be staying.
L154380	u751	m48	LOGAN	Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
L154313	u751	m48	LOGAN	Yeah...
L154312	u753	m48	MAX	Is the social studies class over for today?
L154311	u751	m48	LOGAN	You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
L154310	u753	m48	MAX	Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
L154309	u751	m48	LOGAN	Something.
L154308	u753	m48	MAX	So what are you gonna do about it?
L154307	u751	m48	LOGAN	People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
L154306	u753	m48	MAX	You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
L154305	u751	m48	LOGAN	Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
L154304	u753	m48	MAX	So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
L154303	u751	m48	LOGAN	Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
L154302	u753	m48	MAX	What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
L154301	u751	m48	LOGAN	One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
L154300	u753	m48	MAX	Girlfriend?
L154299	u751	m48	LOGAN	Lauren's not my wife.
L154298	u753	m48	MAX	How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
L154297	u751	m48	LOGAN	Too early to tell.
L154296	u753	m48	MAX	So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
L154295	u751	m48	LOGAN	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
L154294	u753	m48	MAX	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
L154293	u751	m48	LOGAN	Wasn't that hard.
L154292	u753	m48	MAX	How'd you find me?
L154290	u751	m48	LOGAN	The one you're wearing?
L154289	u753	m48	MAX	Lemme get my coat.
L154287	u751	m48	LOGAN	Can we go somewhere and talk?
L154286	u753	m48	MAX	Sorry about your window.
L154284	u751	m48	LOGAN	Logan Cale.
L154283	u753	m48	MAX	Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
L154282	u751	m48	LOGAN	We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
L154281	u753	m48	MAX	So this guy walks into a bar and says...
L154144	u753	m48	MAX	The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
L154143	u751	m48	LOGAN	Who is...
L154142	u753	m48	MAX	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
L154141	u751	m48	LOGAN	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
L154140	u753	m48	MAX	Whoever that is.
L154139	u751	m48	LOGAN	You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
L154138	u751	m48	LOGAN	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
L154137	u753	m48	MAX	I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
L154136	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
L154135	u753	m48	MAX	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
L154134	u751	m48	LOGAN	I was expecting someone else.
L154133	u753	m48	MAX	First time I ever heard that.
L154132	u751	m48	LOGAN	Thank God.
L154131	u753	m48	MAX	Girl's gotta make a living.
L154130	u751	m48	LOGAN	You're a thief?
L154265	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'll wait.
L154264	u754	m48	NORMAL	None.
L154263	u751	m48	LOGAN	Any idea when she'll be back?
L154262	u754	m48	NORMAL	Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
L154260	u754	m48	NORMAL	Can't help you.
L154259	u751	m48	LOGAN	I need to talk to her.
L154258	u754	m48	NORMAL	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
L154257	u751	m48	LOGAN	But she does work here?
L154256	u754	m48	NORMAL	You don't want to.
L154255	u751	m48	LOGAN	Know where I can find her?
L154254	u754	m48	NORMAL	Ladies would be elsewhere.
L154253	u751	m48	LOGAN	I'm looking for a lady who works here.
L154361	u753	m48	MAX	And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
L154360	u752	m48	LYDIA	I understand.
L154359	u753	m48	MAX	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
L154358	u752	m48	LYDIA	Okay, okay.
L154357	u753	m48	MAX	Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
L154356	u752	m48	LYDIA	Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
L154354	u752	m48	LYDIA	Let go of my hand.
L154353	u753	m48	MAX	This is not a place you wanna go.
L154352	u752	m48	LYDIA	Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
L154351	u753	m48	MAX	I think you should go now.
L154350	u752	m48	LYDIA	You're also a fool.
L154349	u753	m48	MAX	Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
L154348	u752	m48	LYDIA	How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
L154347	u753	m48	MAX	Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
L154346	u752	m48	LYDIA	Oh?
L154345	u753	m48	MAX	And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
L154344	u752	m48	LYDIA	I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
L154343	u753	m48	MAX	Look, I don't know what you want--
L154342	u752	m48	LYDIA	He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
L154341	u753	m48	MAX	How do I know you're telling the truth?
L154340	u752	m48	LYDIA	With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
L154339	u753	m48	MAX	You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
L154338	u752	m48	LYDIA	My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
L154337	u753	m48	MAX	Who are you?
L154336	u752	m48	LYDIA	To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
L154335	u753	m48	MAX	What do you want?
L154334	u752	m48	LYDIA	A friend of your fiance's.
L154333	u753	m48	MAX	Who is it?
L154676	u753	m48	MAX	I'm on my way.
L154675	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
L154674	u753	m48	MAX	Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
L154673	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Got a pencil?
L154672	u753	m48	MAX	Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
L154669	u753	m48	MAX	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
L154668	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
L154667	u753	m48	MAX	I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
L154510	u753	m48	MAX	You and me both.
L154509	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
L154508	u753	m48	MAX	Bastard...
L154507	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
L154506	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
L154505	u753	m48	MAX	You're crazy.
L154504	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
L154503	u753	m48	MAX	Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
L154502	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
L154501	u753	m48	MAX	How's this about me?
L154500	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
L154499	u753	m48	MAX	Here's your money.
L154498	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
L154495	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
L154494	u753	m48	MAX	As long as you're okay.
L154115	u753	m48	MAX	More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
L154114	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
L154113	u753	m48	MAX	You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
L154112	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
L154111	u753	m48	MAX	What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
L154110	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
L154109	u753	m48	MAX	She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
L154108	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
L154107	u753	m48	MAX	Nothing on Hannah?
L154106	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
L154105	u753	m48	MAX	Then what?
L154104	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
L154102	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
L154101	u753	m48	MAX	Thank you.
L154100	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
L154099	u753	m48	MAX	Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
L154098	u753	m48	MAX	Sorry, I was seven at the time.
L154097	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
L154096	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	Right here someplace.
L154095	u753	m48	MAX	My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
L154094	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
L154093	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
L154092	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	You drive away business roarin' in like that.
L154091	u753	m48	MAX	You did.
L154090	u760	m48	VOGELSANG	I asked you to keep that thing outside.
L154280	u753	m48	MAX	But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
L154279	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
L154278	u753	m48	MAX	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
L154277	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Only one I can think of.
L154276	u753	m48	MAX	They don't have a lot of moving parts.
L154275	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	So are dogs.
L154274	u753	m48	MAX	They're prisoners to their genes.
L154273	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Please...
L154272	u753	m48	MAX	And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
L154271	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Friends don't help other friends cheat.
L154270	u753	m48	MAX	And because he's my friend.
L154269	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Unlikely.
L154268	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
L154267	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
L154089	u753	m48	MAX	It's a secret.
L154088	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Where?
L154087	u753	m48	MAX	Gotta go.
L154086	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
L154085	u753	m48	MAX	A fog bank.
L154084	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
L154083	u753	m48	MAX	Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
L154082	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
L154081	u753	m48	MAX	A long time.
L154080	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	How long you and me known each other?
L154079	u753	m48	MAX	If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
L154078	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You know what I'm saying.
L154077	u753	m48	MAX	A little what?
L154076	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
L154075	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah.
L154074	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
L154073	u753	m48	MAX	No.
L154072	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
L154071	u753	m48	MAX	Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
L154070	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	What?
L154069	u753	m48	MAX	That's odd...
L154062	u753	m48	MAX	I just don't go in with any expectations.
L154061	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
L154060	u753	m48	MAX	What guys do.  'Nother order.
L154059	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
L154005	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
L154004	u753	m48	MAX	Straight.
L154003	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
L154002	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
L154001	u753	m48	MAX	At least he didn't swing with your ride.
L154000	u755	m48	ORIGINAL CINDY	Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
L153999	u753	m48	MAX	Morning, Sunshine...
L154625	u753	m48	MAX	Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
L154624	u757	m48	SONRISA	You get it when I get her.
L154623	u753	m48	MAX	Can you put that in a bag or something?
L154608	u753	m48	MAX	She's gonna want to hear for herself.
L154607	u757	m48	SONRISA	She's got my word.
L154606	u753	m48	MAX	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
L154605	u757	m48	SONRISA	Make the call.
L154604	u753	m48	MAX	I have sincere eyes.
L154603	u757	m48	SONRISA	And she bought that?
L154602	u753	m48	MAX	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
L154601	u757	m48	SONRISA	So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
L154598	u757	m48	SONRISA	Pull the cash.
L154597	u753	m48	MAX	Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
L154590	u753	m48	MAX	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
L154589	u757	m48	SONRISA	Who are you?
L154585	u753	m48	MAX	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
L154584	u757	m48	SONRISA	I actually know how this works.
L154583	u753	m48	MAX	Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
L154582	u757	m48	SONRISA	Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
L154581	u753	m48	MAX	Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
L154580	u757	m48	SONRISA	Not right now?  Okay, when?
L154579	u753	m48	MAX	Not right now.
L154578	u757	m48	SONRISA	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
L154577	u753	m48	MAX	Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
L154209	u753	m48	MAX	You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
L154208	u759	m48	THEO	Tell everybody hey.
L154207	u753	m48	MAX	Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
L154206	u759	m48	THEO	What if he's on the level?
L154205	u753	m48	MAX	Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
L154204	u759	m48	THEO	I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
L154203	u753	m48	MAX	Probably a touch of what's going around.
L154202	u759	m48	THEO	Feel like the dog's dinner.
L154201	u753	m48	MAX	Playing hooky again?
L153973	u759	m48	THEO	You're the best, Maxie.
L153972	u753	m48	MAX	It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
L154524	u753	m48	MAX	Shut-up...
L154523	u756	m48	SKETCHY	That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
L154373	u753	m48	MAX	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
L154372	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Okay, okay, okay--
L154371	u753	m48	MAX	You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
L154370	u756	m48	SKETCHY	True, but--
L154369	u753	m48	MAX	None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
L154368	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She was the one--
L154367	u753	m48	MAX	You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
L154366	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
L154365	u753	m48	MAX	Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
L154364	u756	m48	SKETCHY	No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
L154363	u753	m48	MAX	Easy Sketchy.
L154362	u756	m48	SKETCHY	You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
L154328	u753	m48	MAX	You don't.
L154327	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
L154326	u753	m48	MAX	I'll give it my best shot.
L154325	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
L154324	u753	m48	MAX	And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
L154323	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
L154322	u753	m48	MAX	How'd you get her out of town?
L154321	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
L154320	u753	m48	MAX	Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
L154319	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
L154318	u753	m48	MAX	--a philandering pig.
L154317	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She tells you how I've been--
L154316	u753	m48	MAX	You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
L154315	u756	m48	SKETCHY	So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
L154250	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
L154249	u753	m48	MAX	And why should she?
L154248	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
L154247	u753	m48	MAX	What happens if you level with her?
L154246	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
L154245	u753	m48	MAX	Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
L154244	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
L154243	u753	m48	MAX	A toy?
L154242	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I'm a toy to her.
L154241	u753	m48	MAX	And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
L154240	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Lydia.
L154239	u753	m48	MAX	Does this person have a name?
L154238	u756	m48	SKETCHY	She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
L154237	u753	m48	MAX	Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
L154236	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Exactly.
L154235	u753	m48	MAX	And you were a sympathetic ear.
L154234	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
L154233	u753	m48	MAX	Really?
L154232	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I'm the victim here.
L154231	u753	m48	MAX	Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
L154230	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But there's another side--
L154229	u753	m48	MAX	You left out condescending.
L154228	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
L154227	u753	m48	MAX	Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
L154226	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Max--
L154225	u753	m48	MAX	Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
L154224	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
L154223	u753	m48	MAX	I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
L154221	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
L154220	u753	m48	MAX	You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
L154218	u753	m48	MAX	What's up?
L154217	u756	m48	SKETCHY	We gotta talk.
L154216	u753	m48	MAX	Hey, Sketchy--
L154030	u756	m48	SKETCHY	But I'll take a rain check...
L154029	u753	m48	MAX	Right, the big one-oh.
L154028	u756	m48	SKETCHY	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
L154027	u753	m48	MAX	Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
L154018	u756	m48	SKETCHY	Later.
L154017	u753	m48	MAX	Catch you back at the wall.
L154521	u753	m48	MAX	Theo's dead.
L154520	u754	m48	NORMAL	Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
L154332	u753	m48	MAX	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
L154331	u754	m48	NORMAL	What about this?
L154330	u753	m48	MAX	Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
L154329	u754	m48	NORMAL	Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
L153998	u753	m48	MAX	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
L153997	u754	m48	NORMAL	You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
L153996	u753	m48	MAX	How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
L153995	u754	m48	NORMAL	For a change.
L153994	u753	m48	MAX	He's sick.
L153993	u754	m48	NORMAL	And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
L153992	u753	m48	MAX	I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
L153991	u754	m48	NORMAL	More like deployed in bed asleep.
L153990	u753	m48	MAX	What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
L153989	u754	m48	NORMAL	I want you on call here.
L153988	u753	m48	MAX	I was on call. 
L153987	u754	m48	NORMAL	This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
L169012	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
L169011	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	GOOD MORNING!
L169010	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Are you AFRAID?
L169009	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	GOOD MORNING!
L169008	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
L169007	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	Good MORNING!
L169006	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
L169005	u777	m50	AUDIENCE	Good morning...
L169004	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Good morning, mongrels!
L169319	u778	m50	DAVID	Did you know him?
L169318	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah.
L169317	u778	m50	DAVID	I feel bad for his family.
L169316	u778	m50	DAVID	Donnie. Donnie Darko.
L169315	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What was his name?
L169314	u778	m50	DAVID	He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
L169313	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What happened?
L169312	u778	m50	DAVID	Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
L169311	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hi... what's going on here?
L169122	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
L169121	u779	m50	DONNIE	Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
L169120	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
L169119	u779	m50	DONNIE	If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
L169118	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	I'm not following you.
L169117	u779	m50	DONNIE	If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
L169116	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
L169115	u779	m50	DONNIE	Could these wormholes appear in nature?
L169114	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
L169113	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
L169112	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Beg pardon?
L169111	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a spear.
L169110	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
L169070	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
L169069	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
L169068	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
L168915	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	A metal craft of any kind.
L168914	u779	m50	DONNIE	Like a DeLorean.
L168913	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
L168912	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... that's it?
L168911	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
L168910	u779	m50	DONNIE	-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
L168909	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Theoretically.
L168908	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
L168907	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
L168906	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
L168905	u780	m50	DR. MONNITOFF	Donnie.
L168904	u779	m50	DONNIE	Dr. Monnitoff?
L168711	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	Donnie! Give it back!
L168710	u779	m50	DONNIE	The Last Unicorn! By Samantha Darko.
L168655	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
L168654	u779	m50	DONNIE	What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
L168636	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	I'm telling Mom.
L168635	u779	m50	DONNIE	When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
L168634	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
L168575	u779	m50	DONNIE	Not until like... eighth grade.
L168574	u793	m50	SAMANTHA	When can I squeeze one out?
L169288	u779	m50	DONNIE	Our saviour...
L169287	u795	m50	SETH	What did you say?
L169286	u779	m50	DONNIE	Dea ex machina...
L168955	u795	m50	SETH	You know what? I think that you did it.
L168954	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
L168953	u795	m50	SETH	That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
L168952	u779	m50	DONNIE	I didn't say shit.
L168951	u795	m50	SETH	Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
L169091	u784	m50	FRANK	You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
L169090	u779	m50	DONNIE	How much longer is this gonna last?
L169089	u784	m50	FRANK	It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
L169088	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why do they call you Frank?
L169087	u784	m50	FRANK	I am so sorry.
L169086	u779	m50	DONNIE	What happened to your eye?
L169084	u779	m50	DONNIE	Take it off. I want to see you.
L169083	u784	m50	FRANK	Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
L169082	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
L169081	u784	m50	FRANK	You have a request?
L169080	u779	m50	DONNIE	You have to do something for me first.
L169079	u784	m50	FRANK	I want to show you something.
L168855	u784	m50	FRANK	Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
L168854	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where did you come from?
L168853	u784	m50	FRANK	You'll know soon enough.
L168852	u779	m50	DONNIE	Who is... we?
L168851	u784	m50	FRANK	We just want to guide you in the right direction.
L168850	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why did you make me flood the school?
L168836	u784	m50	FRANK	I can do anything I want... and so can you...
L168835	u779	m50	DONNIE	How can you do that?
L169307	u779	m50	DONNIE	Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
L169306	u791	m50	RONALD	What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
L168829	u779	m50	DONNIE	A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
L168828	u791	m50	RONALD	How old is Grandma Death?
L168652	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't wanna talk about it.
L168651	u791	m50	RONALD	My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
L168650	u779	m50	DONNIE	We went to a hotel.
L168649	u791	m50	RONALD	DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
L169280	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah...
L169279	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Is that a cellar door?
L169275	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Who's Frank?
L169274	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. Frank.
L169273	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Why? Is this about the book?
L169272	u779	m50	DONNIE	Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
L169270	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Where are we going?
L169269	u779	m50	DONNIE	Come with me.
L169265	u779	m50	DONNIE	There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
L169264	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What?
L169260	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's safe here.
L169259	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
L169258	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
L169257	u779	m50	DONNIE	Did you call the cops?
L169256	u779	m50	DONNIE	But you're OK?
L169255	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
L169254	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where is she?
L169253	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	My mom is gone.
L169252	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hey. You OK?
L169251	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hey.
L169170	u779	m50	DONNIE	Then when? I have to talk to you.
L169169	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
L169168	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you please talk to me?
L169142	u779	m50	DONNIE	What do you mean?
L169141	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What's wrong with you?
L169140	u779	m50	DONNIE	You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
L169099	u779	m50	DONNIE	The whole movie. Let's go.
L169098	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What? How long was I asleep?
L169067	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
L169066	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
L169065	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Infant Memory Generators.
L169064	u779	m50	DONNIE	So, we call them... IMGs.
L169044	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Maybe she's asleep.
L169043	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
L169042	u779	m50	DONNIE	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
L169041	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"
L169040	u779	m50	DONNIE	The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
L169039	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Who?
L169038	u779	m50	DONNIE	I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
L169037	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Are you okay?
L169036	u779	m50	DONNIE	They suspended me for two days.
L169016	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What?
L169015	u779	m50	DONNIE	We're moving through time.
L168973	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
L168972	u779	m50	DONNIE	I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
L168971	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
L168970	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's alright... I understand.
L168969	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You want to kiss me...
L168968	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well...
L168967	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And what?
L168966	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
L168965	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
L168964	u779	m50	DONNIE	With, like, images?
L168963	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
L168962	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
L168961	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
L168958	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
L168957	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	What happened to your neck?
L168874	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
L168873	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why?
L168872	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
L168871	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah?
L168870	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Donnie?
L168869	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	And you'd never been there before?
L168868	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
L168867	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
L168866	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
L168865	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
L168864	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
L168863	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
L168783	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I'm going home.
L168782	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where are you going?
L168781	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Sure.
L168780	u779	m50	DONNIE	No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
L168779	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Where are we going?
L168778	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you go with me?
L168777	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	That was a compliment.
L168776	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry.
L168775	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You're weird.
L168774	u779	m50	DONNIE	We never would have had this conversation.
L168773	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Why is that?
L168772	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
L168771	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Until it withers away.
L168770	u779	m50	DONNIE	The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
L168769	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Wonder where we'll be then.
L168768	u779	m50	DONNIE	Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
L168767	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	You mean soap?
L168766	u779	m50	DONNIE	I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
L168765	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's easy. Antiseptics.
L168764	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
L168763	u779	m50	DONNIE	What makes you think I'm not?
L168762	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
L168761	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
L168760	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
L168759	u779	m50	DONNIE	Wow. Did he go to jail?
L168758	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
L168757	u779	m50	DONNIE	Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
L168756	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
L168755	u779	m50	DONNIE	So... you just moved here?
L168754	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Fuck them.
L168753	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
L168752	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Don't look so freaked.
L168751	u779	m50	DONNIE	Sure.
L168750	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Wanna walk me home?
L168749	u779	m50	DONNIE	School's cancelled.
L168748	u785	m50	GRETCHEN	Hey...
L168747	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hey...
L168895	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
L168894	u779	m50	DONNIE	People aren't that simple.
L168893	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
L168892	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
L168891	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
L168890	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The Lifeline is divided that way.
L168889	u779	m50	DONNIE	I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
L168888	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
L168887	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
L169159	u792	m50	ROSE	It feels wonderful.
L169158	u779	m50	DONNIE	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
L169157	u792	m50	ROSE	If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
L169156	u779	m50	DONNIE	Do you get to meet Ed?
L169155	u792	m50	ROSE	I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
L169063	u779	m50	DONNIE	Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
L169062	u792	m50	ROSE	He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
L168922	u792	m50	ROSE	That is a terrible nickname.
L168921	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death.
L168599	u779	m50	DONNIE	Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
L168598	u792	m50	ROSE	You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
L168597	u779	m50	DONNIE	I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
L168596	u792	m50	ROSE	I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
L168588	u792	m50	ROSE	We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
L168587	u779	m50	DONNIE	Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
L168583	u792	m50	ROSE	When did you stop taking your medication?
L168582	u779	m50	DONNIE	You're such a fuck-ass.
L168571	u792	m50	ROSE	No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
L168570	u779	m50	DONNIE	Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
L169105	u782	m50	EDDIE	I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
L169104	u779	m50	DONNIE	I know, Dad.
L169103	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're my only son...
L169102	u779	m50	DONNIE	A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
L169101	u782	m50	EDDIE	Who's been giving you weird looks?
L168927	u779	m50	DONNIE	I guess she just lost faith in the world.
L168926	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
L168924	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
L168923	u782	m50	EDDIE	Grandma Death.
L168685	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death.
L168684	u782	m50	EDDIE	Oh, shit!
L168683	u782	m50	EDDIE	You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
L168682	u779	m50	DONNIE	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
L168681	u782	m50	EDDIE	No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
L168680	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where it came from?
L168679	u782	m50	EDDIE	Know what?
L168678	u779	m50	DONNIE	Do they know yet?
L168677	u782	m50	EDDIE	Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
L168676	u779	m50	DONNIE	It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
L168675	u782	m50	EDDIE	So how was school today?
L169185	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
L169184	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
L169183	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
L169182	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
L169181	u779	m50	DONNIE	Cellar door.
L169180	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	"A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful."
L169179	u779	m50	DONNIE	"What's ""Cellar Door""?"
L169178	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
L169177	u779	m50	DONNIE	What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
L169176	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
L169175	u779	m50	DONNIE	That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
L169174	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
L169173	u779	m50	DONNIE	Where are you going?
L169172	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
L169171	u779	m50	DONNIE	Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
L169136	u779	m50	DONNIE	Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
L169135	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
L169134	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
L169133	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
L169132	u779	m50	DONNIE	Why should we care?
L169131	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
L168877	u779	m50	DONNIE	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
L168876	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Who is Frank?
L168668	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
L168667	u789	m50	MS. POMEROY	Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
L169241	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Goodbye, Donald.
L169240	u779	m50	DONNIE	Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
L169239	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
L169238	u779	m50	DONNIE	Thank you.
L169237	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
L169235	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
L169234	u779	m50	DONNIE	It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
L169233	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
L169232	u779	m50	DONNIE	He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
L169231	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where is he, Donald?
L169230	u779	m50	DONNIE	I can see him right now!
L169228	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is he going to kill?
L169227	u779	m50	DONNIE	Frank is going to kill.
L169226	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What is going to happen?
L169224	u779	m50	DONNIE	Soon. Time is almost up.
L169223	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	When will this happen?
L169222	u779	m50	DONNIE	It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
L169221	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Then how is time travel possible?
L169220	u779	m50	DONNIE	Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
L169219	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How is that possible?
L169218	u779	m50	DONNIE	I have the power to build a time machine.
L169217	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where are we going, Donald?
L169216	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Where are we going?
L169215	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
L169214	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	God exists because you're horny.
L169213	u779	m50	DONNIE	Because I'm so horny.
L169212	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Why?
L169211	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think now that he might...
L169210	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	If God exists?
L169209	u779	m50	DONNIE	I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
L169208	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
L169207	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
L169206	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	You've done it again?
L169205	u779	m50	DONNIE	That I did it again.
L169204	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What else makes you feel regret?
L169203	u779	m50	DONNIE	Regret.
L169202	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
L169201	u779	m50	DONNIE	Hungry Hungry Hippos.
L169200	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What did you want for Christmas that year?
L169199	u779	m50	DONNIE	They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
L169198	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
L169197	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes. I went to jail.
L169196	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But you were punished.
L169195	u779	m50	DONNIE	People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
L169194	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
L169193	u779	m50	DONNIE	People get hurt.
L169192	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
L169191	u779	m50	DONNIE	I... I was playing with fire.
L169190	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
L169189	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L169188	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
L169060	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Have you ever made love, Donald?
L169059	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
L169058	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	The good stuff.
L169057	u779	m50	DONNIE	I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
L169056	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I know.
L169055	u779	m50	DONNIE	Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
L169053	u779	m50	DONNIE	You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
L169052	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
L169051	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
L169050	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
L169049	u779	m50	DONNIE	Nothing.
L169048	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What did you find?
L169047	u779	m50	DONNIE	It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
L169046	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And they grow out of our stomachs?
L168942	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	No. That makes you keep searching.
L168941	u779	m50	DONNIE	I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
L168940	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you feel alone right now?
L168939	u779	m50	DONNIE	No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
L168938	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Is Callie still around?
L168937	u779	m50	DONNIE	It reminded me of my dog Callie.
L168936	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How does that make you feel?
L168935	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
L168934	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	A sign from whom?
L168933	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
L168932	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
L168931	u779	m50	DONNIE	I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
L168930	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Can anyone else see him?
L168929	u779	m50	DONNIE	Four times... so far.
L168928	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How many times have you seen Frank?
L168802	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
L168801	u779	m50	DONNIE	No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
L168800	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What about your family, Donnie?
L168799	u779	m50	DONNIE	I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
L168798	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Who is the boss?
L168797	u779	m50	DONNIE	"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
L168796	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What else do you think about during school?
L168795	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think about... fucking a lot during school.
L168794	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I asked you about school.
L168793	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think about girls a lot.
L168792	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How are things going at school?
L168791	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L168790	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you think a lot about girls?
L168789	u779	m50	DONNIE	Gretchen. We're going together now.
L168788	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What is her name?
L168787	u779	m50	DONNIE	I met a girl.
L168786	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	So, tell me about your day, Donald.
L168785	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yes.
L168784	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
L168706	u779	m50	DONNIE	No.  That's stupid.
L168705	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
L168704	u779	m50	DONNIE	Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
L168703	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Follow him where?
L168702	u779	m50	DONNIE	He said to follow him.
L168701	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
L168699	u779	m50	DONNIE	A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
L168698	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I don't own a television.
L168697	u779	m50	DONNIE	Don't you watch the news?
L168696	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	How so?
L168695	u779	m50	DONNIE	I think he saved my life.
L168694	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank.
L168693	u779	m50	DONNIE	His name is Frank.
L168692	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Would you like to talk about this friend?
L168691	u779	m50	DONNIE	So, I met a new friend.
L168690	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
L168689	u779	m50	DONNIE	I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
L168688	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
L169246	u779	m50	DONNIE	Everything is going to be just fine.
L169245	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Okay, but it has to be a small one.
L169244	u779	m50	DONNIE	Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
L169243	u779	m50	DONNIE	Congratulations.
L169242	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
L168987	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
L168986	u779	m50	DONNIE	Her name is Gretchen.
L168985	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
L168984	u779	m50	DONNIE	I was just being honest.
L168983	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
L168982	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
L168981	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	No I don't.  She worries about you.
L168980	u779	m50	DONNIE	Because you tell Mom everything.
L168979	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Why would I tell Mom?
L168978	u779	m50	DONNIE	You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
L168977	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	What's her name?
L168976	u779	m50	DONNIE	Yeah.
L168975	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	So I hear you have a girlfriend.
L168920	u779	m50	DONNIE	Guess who wrote it?
L168919	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
L168918	u779	m50	DONNIE	"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."
L168579	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
L168578	u779	m50	DONNIE	Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
L169035	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
L169034	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
L169032	u779	m50	DONNIE	Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
L169031	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
L169030	u779	m50	DONNIE	Gerald.
L169029	u786	m50	JIM CUNNINGHAM	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
L169028	u779	m50	DONNIE	How much are they paying you to be here?
L169003	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
L169002	u792	m50	ROSE	If that's what you think is necessary.
L169001	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
L169000	u792	m50	ROSE	I... What can we do?
L168999	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
L168998	u792	m50	ROSE	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
L168997	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
L168996	u792	m50	ROSE	Frank?
L168995	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
L168994	u792	m50	ROSE	Come again?
L168993	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	Has your son ever told you about Frank?
L168990	u792	m50	ROSE	Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
L168989	u781	m50	DR. THURMAN	What I think is going on with your son.
L168988	u792	m50	ROSE	Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
L168642	u782	m50	EDDIE	He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
L168641	u792	m50	ROSE	He was a year ahead of us?
L168640	u782	m50	EDDIE	Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
L168639	u792	m50	ROSE	What?
L168633	u782	m50	EDDIE	You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
L168632	u792	m50	ROSE	So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
L168602	u782	m50	EDDIE	You're not a bitch.
L168601	u792	m50	ROSE	Our son just called me a bitch.
L169163	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
L169162	u792	m50	ROSE	Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
L168594	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
L168593	u792	m50	ROSE	It is a big deal.
L168592	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
L168591	u792	m50	ROSE	How did you know --
L168590	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
L168586	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	You can suck a fuck.
L168585	u792	m50	ROSE	That's enough.
L168584	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
L168577	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	Donnie? You're a dick.
L168576	u792	m50	ROSE	Excuse me?
L168573	u792	m50	ROSE	If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
L168572	u783	m50	ELIZABETH	I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
L168734	u787	m50	LEROY	I guess they made him do it.
L168733	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	How did this happen?
L168732	u787	m50	LEROY	Yep.
L168731	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Christ. Is that an axe?
L168730	u787	m50	LEROY	What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
L168729	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	What else?
L168728	u787	m50	LEROY	I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
L169153	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
L169152	u792	m50	ROSE	Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
L169151	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
L169150	u792	m50	ROSE	But now you can't go.
L169149	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
L169148	u792	m50	ROSE	Beg pardon?
L169147	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
L169146	u792	m50	ROSE	Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
L169145	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
L169144	u792	m50	ROSE	Kitty...
L169143	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose.
L168899	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
L168898	u792	m50	ROSE	Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
L168862	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
L168861	u792	m50	ROSE	Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
L168858	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
L168857	u792	m50	ROSE	Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
L168848	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
L168847	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
L168846	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
L168844	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
L168843	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Kitty...
L168842	u788	m50	MS. FARMER	Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
L168841	u790	m50	PRINCIPAL COLE	Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
L169248	u791	m50	RONALD	I stole four beers from my dad.
L169247	u794	m50	SEAN	We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
L168821	u791	m50	RONALD	Not Vanity. He's a homo.
L168820	u794	m50	SEAN	Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
L168819	u791	m50	RONALD	Smurfette doesn't fuck.
L168818	u794	m50	SEAN	No more fuckin' for her.
L168817	u791	m50	RONALD	Wicked.
L168815	u794	m50	SEAN	Raspberry.
L168814	u791	m50	RONALD	What is this shit?
L168720	u791	m50	RONALD	Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
L168719	u794	m50	SEAN	All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
L168717	u794	m50	SEAN	Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
L168716	u791	m50	RONALD	There's no rule!
L168715	u794	m50	SEAN	You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
L168714	u791	m50	RONALD	Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
L168660	u794	m50	SEAN	Go back to China, bitch!
L168659	u791	m50	RONALD	Chut up!
L194856	u861	m55	JOEL	No one.
L194855	u858	m55	CARRIE	Who was the girl you walked off with?
L194854	u858	m55	CARRIE	I told you that later.
L194853	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah, you told me that later.
L194852	u858	m55	CARRIE	This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
L194851	u861	m55	JOEL	I remember.
L194850	u858	m55	CARRIE	I did. You said, things were fine.
L194849	u861	m55	JOEL	I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
L194847	u861	m55	JOEL	Just a little overworked, maybe.
L194846	u858	m55	CARRIE	I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
L194826	u858	m55	CARRIE	Say hi to Naomi.
L194825	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194824	u858	m55	CARRIE	I hope you feel better, sweetie.
L194823	u861	m55	JOEL	Thanks, guys.
L194403	u858	m55	CARRIE	Sweetie, we called the company.
L194402	u861	m55	JOEL	They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
L194401	u858	m55	CARRIE	You weren't supposed to see that.
L194398	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
L194397	u858	m55	CARRIE	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
L194394	u861	m55	JOEL	She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
L194393	u858	m55	CARRIE	I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
L194884	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
L194883	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	No, it was lovely.
L194873	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You did? You liked me?
L194872	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	And I just liked you so much.
L194871	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
L194870	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
L194425	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
L194424	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Shit. The last time I saw you.
L194079	u862	m55	MARY	Here we are.
L194078	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Okay, I guess.
L194077	u862	m55	MARY	How are you today?
L194076	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hi.
L194075	u862	m55	MARY	Ms. Kruczynski?
L194053	u862	m55	MARY	Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
L194052	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
L194051	u862	m55	MARY	May I help you?
L194637	u867	m55	PATRICK	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
L194636	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What's wrong with me?
L194574	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
L194573	u867	m55	PATRICK	I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
L194572	u867	m55	PATRICK	I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
L194571	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm so excited. Yay!
L194555	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
L194554	u867	m55	PATRICK	Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
L194553	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
L194552	u867	m55	PATRICK	Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
L194551	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Come up to Boston with me?
L194550	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
L194549	u867	m55	PATRICK	Oh, Tangerine.
L194548	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
L194547	u867	m55	PATRICK	Oh, baby, what's going on?
L194334	u867	m55	PATRICK	In the world.
L194333	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	In the room?
L194332	u867	m55	PATRICK	It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
L194329	u867	m55	PATRICK	I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
L194328	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You rat.
L194327	u867	m55	PATRICK	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
L194326	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Come over after I'm done here?
L194325	u867	m55	PATRICK	I was not.
L194324	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You were not.
L194323	u867	m55	PATRICK	I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
L194089	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
L194088	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
L194087	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
L194086	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
L194085	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
L194083	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
L194082	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Okay, I guess.
L194081	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	How are you today?
L195101	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
L195100	u861	m55	JOEL	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
L195099	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
L195098	u861	m55	JOEL	I can't stop thinking about you.
L195097	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock."""
L195072	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
L195071	u861	m55	JOEL	I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
L195070	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
L195069	u861	m55	JOEL	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
L195068	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Doesn't sound like me.
L195067	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know.
L195066	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."
L195065	u861	m55	JOEL	Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
L195064	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
L195063	u861	m55	JOEL	That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
L195062	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	A bully? Moi?
L195061	u861	m55	JOEL	Says you were a bully...
L195060	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
L195045	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
L195044	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, you obviously don't know me.
L195043	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
L195042	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm nervous, too.
L195041	u861	m55	JOEL	-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
L195040	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hey, Joel --
L195039	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
L195038	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	That's okay. I --
L195037	u861	m55	JOEL	Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
L195036	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh, um...
L195035	u861	m55	JOEL	Have sex. Y'know --
L195034	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Make love?
L195033	u861	m55	JOEL	Listen, did you want to make love?
L195032	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel, come here. Please.
L195031	u861	m55	JOEL	I think I should go back.
L195030	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What if?
L195029	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know. What if it breaks?
L195026	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know.
L195025	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
L195000	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194999	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
L194998	u861	m55	JOEL	Tomorrow?
L194997	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	When?
L194996	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194995	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	So you'll call me, right?
L194947	u861	m55	JOEL	I love you.
L194946	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Bye, Joel.
L194945	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
L194944	u861	m55	JOEL	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
L194943	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What if you stay this time?
L194942	u861	m55	JOEL	"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."
L194941	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	So go.
L194938	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
L194937	u861	m55	JOEL	I think we should go.
L194936	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
L194935	u861	m55	JOEL	Naomi.
L194934	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
L194933	u861	m55	JOEL	It's dark.
L194932	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
L194931	u861	m55	JOEL	I knew.
L194929	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
L194928	u861	m55	JOEL	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
L194927	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
L194924	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	It's freezing out here.
L194923	u861	m55	JOEL	What are you doing?
L194922	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Cool.
L194921	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
L194920	u861	m55	JOEL	Female.
L194919	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Male or female?
L194918	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh.
L194917	u861	m55	JOEL	I do sort of live with somebody though.
L194916	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Let's move into this neighborhood.
L194915	u861	m55	JOEL	Um, no.
L194914	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I wish we did. You married?
L194913	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
L194912	u861	m55	JOEL	"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"
L194911	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."
L194910	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah, maybe.
L194909	u861	m55	JOEL	Seems too coincidental that way.
L194908	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I think, before.
L194907	u861	m55	JOEL	Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
L194906	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Me too. There's this poem --
L194905	u861	m55	JOEL	I think she's great.
L194904	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
L194903	u861	m55	JOEL	I love her.
L194902	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
L194901	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay.
L194900	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
L194899	u861	m55	JOEL	yeah?
L194898	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
L194897	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't think I've slept in a year.
L194896	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	But my sleeping is really fucked up.
L194895	u861	m55	JOEL	I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
L194894	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
L194891	u861	m55	JOEL	Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
L194890	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What do we do?
L194889	u861	m55	JOEL	I know.
L194888	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
L194887	u861	m55	JOEL	Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
L194886	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah, like that.
L194885	u861	m55	JOEL	You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
L194882	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm Joel.
L194881	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh God, how horrid.
L194878	u861	m55	JOEL	And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
L194877	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
L194876	u861	m55	JOEL	You said --
L194875	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
L194874	u861	m55	JOEL	You know what I did.
L194869	u861	m55	JOEL	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
L194868	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
L194867	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
L194866	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
L194865	u861	m55	JOEL	You said...
L194863	u861	m55	JOEL	Hi.
L194862	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hi there.
L194822	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
L194821	u861	m55	JOEL	It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
L194820	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I know.
L194819	u861	m55	JOEL	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
L194818	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Probably.
L194817	u861	m55	JOEL	You had the whole human race pegged.
L194816	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I had you pegged, didn't I?
L194815	u861	m55	JOEL	I remember that speech really well.
L194814	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
L194812	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
L194811	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay.
L194810	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
L194809	u861	m55	JOEL	Not yet. Not married.
L194808	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, you're married.
L194807	u861	m55	JOEL	I'd like to... take you out or something.
L194806	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah?
L194805	u861	m55	JOEL	Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
L194804	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
L194788	u861	m55	JOEL	I did it. I guess that means something.
L194787	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Is that what you want?
L194786	u861	m55	JOEL	I told her today I need to end it.
L194768	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
L194767	u861	m55	JOEL	It's very late.
L194766	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Come up and see me... now.
L194765	u861	m55	JOEL	I dropped you off after. You said --
L194764	u861	m55	JOEL	And I didn't have an argument.
L194763	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	So what. Infatuation is good, too.
L194762	u861	m55	JOEL	I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
L194761	u861	m55	JOEL	I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
L194760	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	But you weren't. I could tell.
L194759	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm sure, I said.
L194758	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
L194757	u861	m55	JOEL	We did talk about Naomi.
L194756	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
L194755	u861	m55	JOEL	Right. Something black though.
L194753	u861	m55	JOEL	No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
L194752	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Egad, were you horrified?
L194751	u861	m55	JOEL	God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
L194750	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What was I wearing?
L194749	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194748	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Naomi, I guess.
L194747	u861	m55	JOEL	Do you remember what we talked about?
L194746	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"This is our first ""date"" date."
L194745	u861	m55	JOEL	I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
L194744	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah.
L194743	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
L194688	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I love it!
L194687	u861	m55	JOEL	I scoured the city for it.
L194685	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
L194684	u861	m55	JOEL	Happy Birthday.
L194682	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
L194681	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel!
L194668	u861	m55	JOEL	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
L194667	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
L194663	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
L194662	u861	m55	JOEL	They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
L194661	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
L194660	u861	m55	JOEL	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
L194659	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
L194635	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
L194634	u861	m55	JOEL	He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
L194633	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Really? Is he cute?
L194632	u861	m55	JOEL	There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
L194631	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What?
L194630	u861	m55	JOEL	There's this guy!
L194629	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
L194628	u861	m55	JOEL	I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
L194627	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You remember what happened next?
L194626	u861	m55	JOEL	I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
L194625	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
L194593	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
L194592	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
L194591	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm right here.
L194590	u861	m55	JOEL	I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
L194586	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
L194585	u861	m55	JOEL	What do you mean?
L194584	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What if you hide me?
L194580	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know.
L194579	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
L194578	u861	m55	JOEL	I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
L194577	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh?
L194576	u861	m55	JOEL	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
L194575	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Such a beautiful view.
L194539	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, ""It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
L194538	u861	m55	JOEL	No.
L194537	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
L194536	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah, Tangerine?
L194535	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joely...
L194525	u861	m55	JOEL	No. Thanks.
L194524	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	More?
L194520	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel, you're a liar.
L194519	u861	m55	JOEL	I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
L194518	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I want to know you.
L194517	u861	m55	JOEL	No, it isn't that.
L194516	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
L194483	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
L194482	u861	m55	JOEL	You're drunk.
L194477	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Would you get me another, Joely?
L194476	u861	m55	JOEL	So, um --
L194472	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
L194471	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh, thank God. It's going.
L194470	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
L194469	u861	m55	JOEL	Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
L194468	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
L194467	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
L194466	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't want to talk about this here.
L194465	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What?!
L194464	u861	m55	JOEL	Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
L194463	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You're not ready.
L194462	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't think we're ready.
L194461	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
L194460	u861	m55	JOEL	Let's talk about it later.
L194459	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I want to have a baby.
L194458	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
L194457	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
L194456	u861	m55	JOEL	Where are you going?
L194455	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	How can you watch this crap?
L194438	u861	m55	JOEL	Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
L194437	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
L194436	u861	m55	JOEL	Let me drive you home.
L194434	u861	m55	JOEL	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
L194433	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
L194430	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
L194429	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
L194428	u861	m55	JOEL	Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
L194427	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
L194426	u861	m55	JOEL	I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
L194423	u861	m55	JOEL	It's three.
L194422	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yo ho ho!
L194331	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You didn't say anything about my hair.
L194330	u861	m55	JOEL	How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
L194299	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay.
L194298	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
L194297	u861	m55	JOEL	Tomorrow?
L194296	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	When?
L194295	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194294	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You'll call me, right?
L194293	u861	m55	JOEL	So, I enjoyed meeting you.
L194291	u861	m55	JOEL	Yes.
L194290	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
L194289	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Okay.
L194288	u861	m55	JOEL	I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
L194287	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You should stay.
L194286	u861	m55	JOEL	Sounds good. But right now I should go.
L194285	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
L194284	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah? Oh, great!
L194283	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay.
L194282	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
L194281	u861	m55	JOEL	I think so.
L194280	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
L194279	u861	m55	JOEL	That's scary sounding.
L194278	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
L194277	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh, yeah.
L194276	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
L194275	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
L194274	u861	m55	JOEL	No, not at all.
L194273	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
L194272	u861	m55	JOEL	No.
L194271	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
L194270	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194269	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
L194268	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
L194267	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
L194266	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194265	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
L194264	u861	m55	JOEL	Thanks.
L194263	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
L194262	u861	m55	JOEL	I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
L194261	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
L194260	u861	m55	JOEL	I think about that.
L194259	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
L194258	u861	m55	JOEL	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
L194257	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
L194256	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	But I think I am. I like to think I am.
L194255	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah, I guess.
L194254	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
L194253	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
L194252	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
L194251	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know.
L194250	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
L194249	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah?
L194248	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
L194246	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
L194245	u861	m55	JOEL	Thanks.
L194243	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I know a man who needs a refill.
L194242	u861	m55	JOEL	No. I --
L194241	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
L194240	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, I should probably get going.
L194237	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
L194236	u861	m55	JOEL	You just say. I'm not really --
L194235	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You pick it.
L194234	u861	m55	JOEL	What do you want to hear?
L194232	u861	m55	JOEL	No, I'm okay for now.
L194231	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Ready for another?
L194230	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
L194229	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm fine.
L194228	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
L194227	u861	m55	JOEL	Cheers.
L194226	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
L194225	u861	m55	JOEL	It's pretty.
L194224	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
L194223	u861	m55	JOEL	Frost?
L194222	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
L194221	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know.
L194220	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
L194219	u861	m55	JOEL	Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
L194218	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
L194217	u861	m55	JOEL	Very much.
L194216	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You like that?
L194213	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
L194212	u861	m55	JOEL	Um --
L194211	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
L194210	u861	m55	JOEL	Take care.
L194209	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
L194208	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
L194207	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
L194206	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"I'm just a bit of a wreck. ""I sleep in your hat"" makes me cry.  Me."
L194205	u861	m55	JOEL	What?
L194204	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."
L194203	u861	m55	JOEL	Sort of, um...
L194202	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"
L194201	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
L194200	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
L194199	u861	m55	JOEL	I like to read.
L194198	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	So you like bookstores, huh?
L194197	u861	m55	JOEL	It's okay. I didn't think you were.
L194196	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
L194195	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Wilmont. Near the high school.
L194194	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah.
L194193	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You know Wilmont?
L194192	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm not a stalker.
L194191	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
L194190	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
L194189	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	You're not a stalker or anything, right?
L194188	u861	m55	JOEL	Where do you live?
L194187	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah?
L194186	u861	m55	JOEL	It's okay.
L194185	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't want to take you out of your way.
L194184	u861	m55	JOEL	You're sure? It's cold.
L194183	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
L194182	u861	m55	JOEL	Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
L194181	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
L194180	u861	m55	JOEL	Probably see you at the book store.
L194179	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
L194178	u861	m55	JOEL	It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
L194177	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."
L194176	u861	m55	JOEL	That's okay.
L194175	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
L194174	u861	m55	JOEL	Yes?
L194173	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Joel? It's Joel, right?
L194170	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
L194169	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay.
L194168	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
L194163	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, anyway... Sorry.
L194162	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
L194161	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
L194160	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Why wouldn't you think that about me?
L194159	u861	m55	JOEL	See, I wouldn't think that about you.
L194158	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
L194157	u861	m55	JOEL	"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"
L194156	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
L194155	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm not nuts.
L194154	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
L194153	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know what that means.
L194152	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Huckleberry Hound?
L194151	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know any jokes about your name.
L194150	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
L194149	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm Joel.
L194148	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	My name's Clementine, by the way.
L194147	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Yeah, I got it.
L194146	u861	m55	JOEL	Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
L194145	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
L194144	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh, I doubt that's the case.
L194143	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
L194142	u861	m55	JOEL	You sure? That doesn't sound --
L194141	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
L194140	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm sure you would.
L194139	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
L194138	u861	m55	JOEL	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
L194137	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
L194136	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't really know how --
L194135	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
L194134	u861	m55	JOEL	I can't remember.
L194133	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
L194132	u861	m55	JOEL	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
L194131	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
L194130	u861	m55	JOEL	I like it.
L194129	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
L194128	u861	m55	JOEL	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
L194127	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
L194126	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't have one.
L194125	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
L194124	u861	m55	JOEL	-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
L194123	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
L194122	u861	m55	JOEL	Really? Because --
L194121	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
L194120	u861	m55	JOEL	The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
L194119	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
L194118	u861	m55	JOEL	Rockville Center.
L194117	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
L194116	u861	m55	JOEL	It's okay, really.
L194115	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
L194114	u861	m55	JOEL	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
L194113	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Oh. So...
L194112	u861	m55	JOEL	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
L194111	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
L194110	u861	m55	JOEL	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
L194109	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
L194108	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, I didn't want to assume.
L194107	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Really?
L194106	u861	m55	JOEL	No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
L194105	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
L194104	u861	m55	JOEL	Why what?
L194103	u859	m55	CLEMENTINE	Why?
L194102	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm sorry.
L195096	u861	m55	JOEL	Jesus.
L195095	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Your dried cum.
L195094	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know. Panties and --
L195093	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Guess what I'm wearing.
L195092	u861	m55	JOEL	You must have been crazy.
L195091	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
L195090	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
L195089	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
L195088	u861	m55	JOEL	Hi, it's Joel.
L195058	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
L195057	u861	m55	JOEL	Look, I have to go. I have to think.
L195056	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
L195055	u861	m55	JOEL	It's true.
L195052	u861	m55	JOEL	That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
L195051	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
L195050	u861	m55	JOEL	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
L195049	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	I probably got the same thing as you.
L195048	u861	m55	JOEL	Did you send this? Is it a joke?
L195047	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Yeah?
L195024	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
L195023	u861	m55	JOEL	I guess so.
L195022	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
L195021	u861	m55	JOEL	Oddly enough, I do.
L195020	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	Hmmm. Do you miss me?
L195019	u861	m55	JOEL	I just walked in.
L195018	u860	m55	CLEMENTINE'S VOICE	What took you so long?
L195012	u861	m55	JOEL	There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
L195011	u865	m55	NAOMI'S VOICE	That's me.
L195008	u865	m55	NAOMI'S VOICE	Long day thinking.
L195007	u861	m55	JOEL	I just got in.
L195006	u865	m55	NAOMI'S VOICE	Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
L195005	u861	m55	JOEL	I know. I had to take the day to think.
L195004	u865	m55	NAOMI'S VOICE	Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
L195003	u861	m55	JOEL	How's it going?
L195002	u865	m55	NAOMI'S VOICE	Hi.
L195001	u861	m55	JOEL	Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
L194940	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
L194939	u861	m55	JOEL	I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
L194926	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
L194925	u861	m55	JOEL	Clementine.
L194893	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
L194892	u861	m55	JOEL	So you're still on the Zoloft?
L194861	u861	m55	JOEL	But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
L194860	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
L194859	u861	m55	JOEL	Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
L194841	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
L194840	u861	m55	JOEL	Okay. I wish you could come.
L194779	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
L194778	u861	m55	JOEL	Naomi.
L194691	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
L194690	u861	m55	JOEL	I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
L194583	u861	m55	JOEL	I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
L194582	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	She's so sexy.
L194522	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
L194521	u861	m55	JOEL	How's the chicken?
L194432	u861	m55	JOEL	And what are you like? A wino?
L194431	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
L194382	u861	m55	JOEL	Any messages, Carmen?
L194381	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
L194380	u861	m55	JOEL	So then she just stops calling.
L194337	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
L194336	u861	m55	JOEL	Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
L194322	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	That's your look for me.
L194321	u861	m55	JOEL	Clementine.
L194320	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
L194319	u861	m55	JOEL	I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
L194318	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
L194317	u861	m55	JOEL	I should maybe talk to you.
L194315	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	It's too late.
L194314	u861	m55	JOEL	It's them.
L194310	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
L194309	u861	m55	JOEL	Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
L194308	u861	m55	JOEL	Fuck you, Clementine.
L194307	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
L194306	u861	m55	JOEL	I might be making a mistake.
L194304	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	I'm like a joke to them.
L194303	u861	m55	JOEL	The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
L194302	u871	m55	VOICE-OVER	There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
L194301	u861	m55	JOEL	It was snowing.
L194569	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
L194568	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
L194567	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	What? What do you mean?
L194566	u861	m55	JOEL	You have to stop this!
L194565	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
L194372	u861	m55	JOEL	It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
L194371	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
L194370	u861	m55	JOEL	Well... I did.
L194369	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
L194346	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
L194345	u861	m55	JOEL	Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
L194344	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
L195017	u864	m55	NAOMI	'Night.
L195016	u861	m55	JOEL	We'll speak soon.
L195015	u864	m55	NAOMI	So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
L195014	u861	m55	JOEL	I had a good time last night. I really did.
L195013	u864	m55	NAOMI	Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
L194994	u864	m55	NAOMI	I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
L194993	u861	m55	JOEL	So you think the dissertation will get published?
L194992	u864	m55	NAOMI	I'm glad you called.
L194991	u861	m55	JOEL	I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
L194990	u864	m55	NAOMI	A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
L194989	u861	m55	JOEL	Oh! Great. That's great!
L194988	u864	m55	NAOMI	Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
L194987	u861	m55	JOEL	I miss you.
L194986	u864	m55	NAOMI	Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
L194985	u861	m55	JOEL	Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
L194984	u864	m55	NAOMI	I'm sorry.
L194983	u861	m55	JOEL	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
L194982	u864	m55	NAOMI	So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
L194845	u864	m55	NAOMI	Yeah.
L194844	u861	m55	JOEL	I hope you get your work done.
L194843	u864	m55	NAOMI	Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
L194839	u864	m55	NAOMI	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
L194838	u861	m55	JOEL	So you don't mind?
L194836	u861	m55	JOEL	In a minute.
L194835	u864	m55	NAOMI	Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
L194834	u861	m55	JOEL	Go back to sleep.
L194833	u864	m55	NAOMI	Hi, Rob and Carrie.
L194832	u861	m55	JOEL	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
L194831	u864	m55	NAOMI	How was it?
L194830	u861	m55	JOEL	Hi.
L194829	u864	m55	NAOMI	Hi.
L194798	u861	m55	JOEL	It's not somebody else.
L194797	u864	m55	NAOMI	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
L194796	u861	m55	JOEL	No. I just need some space, maybe.
L194795	u864	m55	NAOMI	Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
L194794	u861	m55	JOEL	I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
L194793	u864	m55	NAOMI	"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""
L194792	u861	m55	JOEL	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
L194791	u864	m55	NAOMI	What?
L194790	u861	m55	JOEL	I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
L194789	u864	m55	NAOMI	So what's going on, Joel?
L194785	u864	m55	NAOMI	Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
L194784	u861	m55	JOEL	Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
L194783	u861	m55	JOEL	You take it. I don't know.
L194782	u864	m55	NAOMI	Yours?
L194514	u862	m55	MARY	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
L194513	u867	m55	PATRICK	Definitely!
L194509	u862	m55	MARY	I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
L194508	u867	m55	PATRICK	Very cool. Trippy.
L194507	u862	m55	MARY	The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts.
L194506	u867	m55	PATRICK	Yeah. Cool.
L194505	u862	m55	MARY	I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
L194497	u867	m55	PATRICK	Nah, I don't know.
L194496	u862	m55	MARY	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
L194485	u867	m55	PATRICK	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
L194484	u862	m55	MARY	Oh, hey, Patrick.
L195116	u869	m55	STAN	Mary... please. This is hurting people.
L195115	u862	m55	MARY	Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
L195114	u869	m55	STAN	The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
L195113	u862	m55	MARY	I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
L195112	u869	m55	STAN	Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
L195111	u862	m55	MARY	They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
L195110	u869	m55	STAN	I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
L195109	u862	m55	MARY	Then why did you ask me?
L195108	u869	m55	STAN	I know what it is.
L195107	u862	m55	MARY	Nothing.
L195106	u869	m55	STAN	What's this?
L195105	u869	m55	STAN	Can I... I brought some --
L195104	u862	m55	MARY	What do you want, Stan?
L195103	u869	m55	STAN	Hi.
L195102	u862	m55	MARY	Oh.
L194970	u862	m55	MARY	Thanks, Stan.
L194969	u869	m55	STAN	You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
L194968	u862	m55	MARY	Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
L194967	u869	m55	STAN	I really like you, Mary. You know that.
L194966	u869	m55	STAN	I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
L194965	u862	m55	MARY	And after that?
L194964	u869	m55	STAN	Happy. Happy with a secret.
L194963	u862	m55	MARY	How did I look?
L194962	u869	m55	STAN	It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
L194961	u869	m55	STAN	Once, maybe.
L194960	u862	m55	MARY	And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
L194959	u869	m55	STAN	I swear.
L194958	u862	m55	MARY	Do you swear you didn't know?
L194957	u869	m55	STAN	Hey.
L194620	u862	m55	MARY	Hell no.
L194619	u869	m55	STAN	You better go.
L194618	u862	m55	MARY	He's coming?
L194607	u862	m55	MARY	This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
L194606	u869	m55	STAN	No way. I can handle this.
L194604	u869	m55	STAN	Shit!
L194603	u862	m55	MARY	Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
L194602	u869	m55	STAN	I don't know! I just said that!
L194601	u862	m55	MARY	Well, what should we do?
L194600	u869	m55	STAN	I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
L194599	u869	m55	STAN	I don't know. He's not on the map.
L194598	u862	m55	MARY	Where?
L194597	u869	m55	STAN	It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
L194596	u869	m55	STAN	Listen, it's not erasing.
L194595	u862	m55	MARY	What?
L194594	u869	m55	STAN	It's stopped.
L194545	u869	m55	STAN	You love him, don't you?
L194544	u862	m55	MARY	To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
L194543	u869	m55	STAN	Yeah.
L194542	u862	m55	MARY	It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
L194533	u869	m55	STAN	Go.
L194532	u862	m55	MARY	Let him go, Stan. I can help.
L194512	u869	m55	STAN	Yup.
L194511	u862	m55	MARY	Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
L194510	u869	m55	STAN	Yup.
L194502	u869	m55	STAN	It's a good one all right.
L194501	u862	m55	MARY	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
L194500	u869	m55	STAN	That's a good one.
L194499	u862	m55	MARY	Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
L194491	u862	m55	MARY	Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
L194490	u869	m55	STAN	We haven't checked.
L194489	u862	m55	MARY	Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
L194488	u869	m55	STAN	You found us okay?
L194487	u862	m55	MARY	It's freezing out.
L194074	u862	m55	MARY	I better do this, Stan.
L194073	u869	m55	STAN	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
L194072	u862	m55	MARY	'kay.
L194071	u869	m55	STAN	See you later, alligator.
L194070	u862	m55	MARY	Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
L194069	u869	m55	STAN	I know. Anyway --
L194068	u862	m55	MARY	It's just... y'know... I mean...
L194067	u869	m55	STAN	Sorry. I just --
L194066	u862	m55	MARY	Stan... c'mon...
L194064	u862	m55	MARY	Hi.
L194063	u869	m55	STAN	Boo.
L194981	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
L194980	u862	m55	MARY	You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
L194979	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	It was a mutual decision.
L194978	u862	m55	MARY	You made me have an abortion.
L194977	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I have a family, Mary.
L194976	u862	m55	MARY	"Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!"
L194975	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
L194974	u862	m55	MARY	Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
L194734	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
L194733	u862	m55	MARY	What, Howard?
L194722	u862	m55	MARY	No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
L194721	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	We can't do this.
L194720	u862	m55	MARY	I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
L194719	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
L194718	u862	m55	MARY	I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
L194716	u862	m55	MARY	Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
L194715	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
L194714	u862	m55	MARY	Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
L194713	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	That's lovely.
L194711	u862	m55	MARY	You are such a sweetheart.
L194710	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	It's no big deal.
L194709	u862	m55	MARY	Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
L194708	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Alexander Pope?
L194707	u862	m55	MARY	There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
L194706	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
L194705	u862	m55	MARY	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
L194704	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Is that Nietzsche?
L194703	u862	m55	MARY	"Okay, um, there's one that goes ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."""
L194702	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
L194701	u862	m55	MARY	Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
L194700	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	How do you mean?
L194699	u862	m55	MARY	Do you like quotes, Howard?
L194656	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Well, thank you, Mary.
L194655	u862	m55	MARY	That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
L194654	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Okay, we're back in.
L194062	u862	m55	MARY	Welcome, Howard.
L194061	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Thanks.
L194060	u862	m55	MARY	Cole slaw, ice tea?
L194059	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Order me a pastrami for after?
L194058	u862	m55	MARY	Yes?
L194057	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Mary...
L194056	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
L194055	u862	m55	MARY	Howard, your one o'clock.
L194617	u870	m55	STAN'S VOICE	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
L194616	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Jesus. All right, what's the address.
L194615	u870	m55	STAN'S VOICE	He went home sick.
L194614	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Well, where was Patrick?
L194613	u870	m55	STAN'S VOICE	I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
L194612	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
L194611	u870	m55	STAN'S VOICE	The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
L194610	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Stan? What's going on?
L195082	u869	m55	STAN	Jesus.
L195081	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
L195080	u869	m55	STAN	I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
L195079	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
L194953	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
L194952	u869	m55	STAN	So, I've got to drop the van off.
L194698	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	That's fine, Stan.
L194697	u869	m55	STAN	I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
L194665	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Oh dear.
L194664	u869	m55	STAN	Howard, they've disappeared again.
L194658	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Yeah, probably a good idea.
L194657	u869	m55	STAN	You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
L194648	u869	m55	STAN	Yeah. Of course.
L194647	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Did you try going through C-Gate?
L194646	u869	m55	STAN	I tried that already.
L194642	u869	m55	STAN	She came to help, Howard.
L194641	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Mary. What are you doing here?
L194361	u869	m55	STAN	December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
L194360	u863	m55	MIERZWIAK	Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
L194050	u868	m55	RECEPTIONIST	Maybe after the holidays then.
L194049	u866	m55	OLD WOMAN	This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
L194047	u868	m55	RECEPTIONIST	Of course. Please have a seat.
L194046	u866	m55	OLD WOMAN	Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
L194045	u868	m55	RECEPTIONIST	I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
L194044	u866	m55	OLD WOMAN	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
L194043	u868	m55	RECEPTIONIST	Oh, hi.
L194561	u867	m55	PATRICK	Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
L194560	u869	m55	STAN	I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
L194531	u867	m55	PATRICK	She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
L194530	u869	m55	STAN	Patrick, we're in the middle of --
L194529	u867	m55	PATRICK	Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
L194504	u869	m55	STAN	It's a quote book.
L194503	u867	m55	PATRICK	What's your bartlett's?
L194494	u867	m55	PATRICK	Okay, There's more, Stan --
L194493	u869	m55	STAN	Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
L194492	u867	m55	PATRICK	Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
L194445	u869	m55	STAN	Jesus, Patrick!
L194444	u867	m55	PATRICK	She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
L194443	u869	m55	STAN	She was unconscious, Patrick.
L194442	u867	m55	PATRICK	I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
L194421	u869	m55	STAN	Patrick, we need to focus.
L194420	u867	m55	PATRICK	The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
L194419	u869	m55	STAN	This one's history. Moving on...
L194418	u867	m55	PATRICK	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
L194417	u869	m55	STAN	You can if you want.
L194416	u867	m55	PATRICK	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
L194415	u869	m55	STAN	She likes you okay.
L194414	u867	m55	PATRICK	I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
L194413	u869	m55	STAN	Just wanted to let you know.
L194412	u867	m55	PATRICK	Yeah?
L194377	u867	m55	PATRICK	Yeah.
L194376	u869	m55	STAN	Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
L194375	u867	m55	PATRICK	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
L194374	u869	m55	STAN	It's an apartment.
L194359	u869	m55	STAN	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
L194358	u867	m55	PATRICK	Does that help?
L194357	u869	m55	STAN	Then check the connections.
L194356	u867	m55	PATRICK	The voltage looks fine.
L195847	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I think I found something...
L195846	u879	m57	COOPER	Justin?
L195845	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Holy shit...
L195842	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
L195841	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
L195840	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
L195839	u879	m57	COOPER	...do you copy?
L195767	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
L195766	u879	m57	COOPER	You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
L195674	u882	m57	JUSTIN	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
L195673	u879	m57	COOPER	I can see why they sent you along.
L195651	u879	m57	COOPER	I heard it.
L195650	u882	m57	JUSTIN	That means top-secret, Cooper.
L195645	u879	m57	COOPER	I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
L195644	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Ballast.
L196373	u884	m57	MILLER	It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
L196372	u879	m57	COOPER	Will it work?
L196371	u884	m57	MILLER	You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
L196370	u879	m57	COOPER	...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
L196239	u884	m57	MILLER	On my way.
L196238	u879	m57	COOPER	Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
L196127	u884	m57	MILLER	I'll get him.
L196126	u879	m57	COOPER	But Justin...
L195894	u884	m57	MILLER	Hold on, Coop...
L195893	u879	m57	COOPER	The containment, Second Containment...
L195892	u884	m57	MILLER	Coop, where are you...
L195891	u879	m57	COOPER	We have a man down...
L195764	u879	m57	COOPER	I'll be all over it.
L195763	u884	m57	MILLER	You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
L195762	u879	m57	COOPER	...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
L195693	u884	m57	MILLER	You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
L195692	u879	m57	COOPER	From what?
L195658	u884	m57	MILLER	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
L195657	u879	m57	COOPER	...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
L195643	u884	m57	MILLER	This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
L195642	u879	m57	COOPER	You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
L195641	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
L195588	u884	m57	MILLER	Don't start with me, Cooper.
L195587	u879	m57	COOPER	Time to play Spam in the can.
L196302	u886	m57	SMITH	Roger that.
L196301	u879	m57	COOPER	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
L196300	u879	m57	COOPER	Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
L196243	u879	m57	COOPER	We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
L196242	u886	m57	SMITH	It's holding... She's holding...!
L196119	u886	m57	SMITH	What about the accumulator...?
L196118	u879	m57	COOPER	We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
L195991	u879	m57	COOPER	You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
L195990	u886	m57	SMITH	You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
L195989	u879	m57	COOPER	Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
L195988	u886	m57	SMITH	You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
L195987	u879	m57	COOPER	What?
L195986	u886	m57	SMITH	I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
L195985	u879	m57	COOPER	You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
L195964	u879	m57	COOPER	"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
L195963	u888	m57	WEIR	What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
L195962	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm telling you, I saw it...
L195961	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know what happened to Justin.
L195958	u888	m57	WEIR	Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
L195957	u879	m57	COOPER	You weren't there. I saw it.
L195956	u888	m57	WEIR	No, he didn't.
L195955	u879	m57	COOPER	It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
L195695	u879	m57	COOPER	Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
L195694	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
L195630	u888	m57	WEIR	No, thank you.
L195629	u879	m57	COOPER	Coffee.
L195628	u888	m57	WEIR	What?
L195627	u879	m57	COOPER	Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
L196384	u887	m57	STARCK	Run!
L196383	u879	m57	COOPER	What...?
L196379	u887	m57	STARCK	Hurry.
L196378	u879	m57	COOPER	I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
L196366	u879	m57	COOPER	I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
L196365	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
L196364	u879	m57	COOPER	Can you shut it down?
L196363	u887	m57	STARCK	There must be a way! What about Engineering?
L196362	u879	m57	COOPER	How? The Bridge is gone.
L196358	u887	m57	STARCK	You're okay now, it's over...
L196357	u879	m57	COOPER	Let me breathe, let me breathe...
L195867	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
L195866	u879	m57	COOPER	What's happening?
L195597	u887	m57	STARCK	It is not.
L195596	u879	m57	COOPER	Is that an offer?
L196337	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh God...
L196336	u880	m57	DJ	Please... kill...
L196335	u884	m57	MILLER	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
L196334	u880	m57	DJ	Please...
L196323	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
L196322	u880	m57	DJ	What happened?
L196321	u884	m57	MILLER	DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
L196237	u880	m57	DJ	No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
L196236	u884	m57	MILLER	Save yourself. From Hell.  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
L196235	u880	m57	DJ	"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""
L196234	u884	m57	MILLER	Hear what?
L196233	u880	m57	DJ	Do you hear it? Right there.
L196231	u880	m57	DJ	It gets worse.
L196230	u884	m57	MILLER	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
L196229	u880	m57	DJ	"They thought it said, ""Liberatis me,"" ""Save me,"" but it's not ""me."" It's ""tutemet:"" ""Save yourself."""
L196228	u884	m57	MILLER	Go on.
L196227	u880	m57	DJ	I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
L196226	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it?
L196225	u880	m57	DJ	No.
L196224	u884	m57	MILLER	I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
L196222	u880	m57	DJ	Another man? Who?
L196221	u884	m57	MILLER	Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
L196190	u884	m57	MILLER	We'll make it.
L196189	u880	m57	DJ	He'll live... if we ever make it back.
L196076	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
L196075	u880	m57	DJ	To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
L196048	u884	m57	MILLER	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
L196047	u880	m57	DJ	Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
L195941	u880	m57	DJ	His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
L195940	u884	m57	MILLER	How is he?
L195919	u884	m57	MILLER	No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
L195918	u880	m57	DJ	We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
L195648	u884	m57	MILLER	And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
L195647	u880	m57	DJ	Trauma.
L195646	u884	m57	MILLER	He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
L196188	u880	m57	DJ	One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
L196187	u885	m57	PETERS	His peritoneum has ruptured...
L196186	u880	m57	DJ	Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
L196184	u880	m57	DJ	He's crashing...
L196183	u885	m57	PETERS	90 over 50 and falling... .
L196182	u880	m57	DJ	Pressure?
L196181	u885	m57	PETERS	I've got a pulse, he's alive...
L196100	u885	m57	PETERS	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
L196099	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L196023	u880	m57	DJ	A power drain --
L196022	u885	m57	PETERS	What's happening...?
L195984	u885	m57	PETERS	Nothing. It's nothing.
L195983	u880	m57	DJ	What's wrong?
L195564	u881	m57	HOLLIS	Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
L195563	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you.
L195562	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
L195551	u888	m57	WEIR	A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
L195550	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
L195549	u888	m57	WEIR	It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
L195548	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
L195547	u888	m57	WEIR	Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
L195545	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
L195544	u888	m57	WEIR	You wanted to see me, Admiral?
L195575	u883	m57	LYLE	The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
L195574	u881	m57	HOLLIS	I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
L195573	u883	m57	LYLE	Some things you don't get over.
L195572	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
L195571	u883	m57	LYLE	He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
L195570	u881	m57	HOLLIS	What's on your mind?
L195569	u883	m57	LYLE	Does he know that?
L195568	u881	m57	HOLLIS	That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
L195567	u883	m57	LYLE	The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
L195566	u881	m57	HOLLIS	You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
L195565	u883	m57	LYLE	You're not seriously considering sending him?
L195557	u883	m57	LYLE	Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
L195556	u881	m57	HOLLIS	It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
L196160	u885	m57	PETERS	Starck!
L196159	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Oh my god OH MY GOD...
L196148	u882	m57	JUSTIN	From the Other Place...
L196147	u885	m57	PETERS	The dark inside...? I don't understand.
L196146	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
L196145	u882	m57	JUSTIN	The dark inside me.
L196144	u885	m57	PETERS	What does?
L196143	u882	m57	JUSTIN	It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
L196142	u885	m57	PETERS	What, Justin, what shows you?
L195827	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I'm going in.
L195826	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
L195825	u882	m57	JUSTIN	I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
L195802	u888	m57	WEIR	Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
L195801	u882	m57	JUSTIN	We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
L195800	u888	m57	WEIR	You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
L195672	u888	m57	WEIR	I built it.
L195671	u882	m57	JUSTIN	How do you know all this?
L195670	u888	m57	WEIR	...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
L196174	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin. I won't let you die.
L196173	u882	m57	JUSTIN	But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
L196172	u884	m57	MILLER	You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
L196171	u882	m57	JUSTIN	...I don't want to die...!
L196167	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Skipper, you gotta help me...
L196166	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin.
L196165	u884	m57	MILLER	Patch me through to him.
L195854	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
L195853	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, finish your sweep.
L195755	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Yes, sir!
L195754	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
L195583	u884	m57	MILLER	Start the countdown.
L195582	u882	m57	JUSTIN	Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
L195561	u888	m57	WEIR	Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
L195560	u883	m57	LYLE	The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
L195559	u888	m57	WEIR	The crew? Could they still be alive?
L195558	u883	m57	LYLE	Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
L195555	u888	m57	WEIR	This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
L195554	u883	m57	LYLE	I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
L195553	u888	m57	WEIR	I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
L195552	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
L195543	u883	m57	LYLE	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
L195542	u888	m57	WEIR	This is Weir.
L196194	u884	m57	MILLER	Thanks.
L196193	u885	m57	PETERS	I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
L196192	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
L196115	u885	m57	PETERS	Justin.
L196114	u884	m57	MILLER	That's a negative, Starck.
L196021	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196020	u885	m57	PETERS	I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
L195947	u884	m57	MILLER	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
L195946	u885	m57	PETERS	I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
L195945	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
L195890	u885	m57	PETERS	Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
L195889	u884	m57	MILLER	...you okay?
L195888	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters...
L195887	u885	m57	PETERS	Skipper...
L195886	u884	m57	MILLER	Can anybody hear me...
L195852	u885	m57	PETERS	Crystallized.
L195851	u884	m57	MILLER	...how's the client?
L195850	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
L195831	u885	m57	PETERS	Frozen.
L195830	u884	m57	MILLER	Alive?
L195829	u885	m57	PETERS	I found one.
L195819	u884	m57	MILLER	The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
L195818	u885	m57	PETERS	Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
L195817	u884	m57	MILLER	What you got, Peters?
L195816	u885	m57	PETERS	Okay. I'm on the bridge.
L195812	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here, Skipper.
L195811	u884	m57	MILLER	The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
L195792	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, you still showing those readings?
L195791	u885	m57	PETERS	I can see the hatch.
L195788	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
L195787	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters is right, no one's here.
L195783	u884	m57	MILLER	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
L195782	u885	m57	PETERS	That means they didn't abandon ship.
L195773	u884	m57	MILLER	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
L195772	u885	m57	PETERS	Jesus its huge.
L195771	u884	m57	MILLER	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
L195770	u885	m57	PETERS	We've got pressure.
L195595	u884	m57	MILLER	I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
L195594	u885	m57	PETERS	No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
L195593	u884	m57	MILLER	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
L195592	u885	m57	PETERS	Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
L195591	u884	m57	MILLER	What's the hold up?
L196428	u888	m57	WEIR	NOOO!
L196427	u884	m57	MILLER	You can't have them. Go to hell.
L196425	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck... Cooper...
L196424	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
L196423	u884	m57	MILLER	You're lying...!
L196422	u888	m57	WEIR	There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
L196417	u888	m57	WEIR	Better if I just show you.
L196416	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
L196415	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm not the Devil.
L196414	u884	m57	MILLER	You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
L196413	u888	m57	WEIR	You know.
L196412	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you?
L196401	u888	m57	WEIR	Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
L196400	u884	m57	MILLER	Then who the fuck are you?
L196399	u888	m57	WEIR	Weir is dead.
L196348	u888	m57	WEIR	What makes you think I'll miss?
L196347	u884	m57	MILLER	If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
L196343	u888	m57	WEIR	Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
L196342	u884	m57	MILLER	What are you talking about?
L196341	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
L196340	u884	m57	MILLER	Your eyes...
L196332	u884	m57	MILLER	Son of a bitch!
L196331	u888	m57	WEIR	I told you... She won't let you leave...
L196272	u884	m57	MILLER	Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
L196271	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't leave. She won't let you.
L196265	u884	m57	MILLER	Watch me.
L196264	u888	m57	WEIR	You... You can't do that!
L196263	u884	m57	MILLER	We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
L196262	u888	m57	WEIR	What about my ship?
L196258	u884	m57	MILLER	It's done.
L196257	u888	m57	WEIR	Don't... don't do this...
L196256	u884	m57	MILLER	Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
L196255	u888	m57	WEIR	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
L196254	u884	m57	MILLER	...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship. The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
L196253	u888	m57	WEIR	You can't, your orders are specific...
L196252	u884	m57	MILLER	We're leaving.
L196217	u884	m57	MILLER	That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
L196216	u888	m57	WEIR	I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
L196215	u884	m57	MILLER	"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
L196214	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196213	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the past seven years?
L196212	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know...
L196211	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
L196210	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes...
L196209	u884	m57	MILLER	You said this ship creates a gateway...
L196208	u888	m57	WEIR	What do you want me to say?
L196207	u884	m57	MILLER	That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
L196206	u888	m57	WEIR	Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
L196205	u884	m57	MILLER	I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
L196198	u888	m57	WEIR	Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
L196197	u884	m57	MILLER	"Is that your ""expert opinion?"" The only answer we've had out of you is ""I don't know."""
L196074	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it.
L196073	u888	m57	WEIR	I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
L196072	u884	m57	MILLER	We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
L196031	u888	m57	WEIR	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
L196030	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
L196025	u888	m57	WEIR	The Core...!
L196024	u884	m57	MILLER	We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
L196019	u888	m57	WEIR	I don't know.
L196018	u884	m57	MILLER	What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
L196009	u888	m57	WEIR	Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
L196008	u884	m57	MILLER	Explanation?
L196005	u888	m57	WEIR	Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
L196004	u884	m57	MILLER	It's 2041...
L196003	u888	m57	WEIR	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
L196002	u884	m57	MILLER	What about it?
L196001	u888	m57	WEIR	The date.
L196000	u884	m57	MILLER	You have something, Dr. Weir?
L195979	u884	m57	MILLER	Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
L195978	u888	m57	WEIR	There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
L195977	u884	m57	MILLER	I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
L195976	u888	m57	WEIR	If it worked, yes.
L195975	u884	m57	MILLER	If it worked.
L195974	u888	m57	WEIR	Insane? The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
L195973	u884	m57	MILLER	It's insane.
L195969	u884	m57	MILLER	How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
L195968	u888	m57	WEIR	It's complicated...
L195967	u884	m57	MILLER	What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
L195966	u888	m57	WEIR	It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
L195965	u884	m57	MILLER	"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""
L195953	u884	m57	MILLER	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
L195952	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195910	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
L195909	u888	m57	WEIR	It beats dying, Mister Smith.
L195799	u884	m57	MILLER	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
L195798	u888	m57	WEIR	No one?
L195797	u884	m57	MILLER	Negative.
L195796	u888	m57	WEIR	Any survivors?
L195790	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
L195789	u884	m57	MILLER	Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
L195781	u888	m57	WEIR	In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
L195780	u884	m57	MILLER	I can see that, what're they for?
L195775	u884	m57	MILLER	Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
L195774	u888	m57	WEIR	You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
L195760	u884	m57	MILLER	-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
L195759	u888	m57	WEIR	That is not acceptable --
L195758	u884	m57	MILLER	Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
L195757	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
L195756	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
L195742	u888	m57	WEIR	Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
L195741	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
L195740	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
L195689	u888	m57	WEIR	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
L195688	u884	m57	MILLER	What does it say?
L195677	u888	m57	WEIR	That's what we're here to find out.
L195676	u884	m57	MILLER	Where has it been for the last seven years?
L195675	u888	m57	WEIR	It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
L195601	u884	m57	MILLER	Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
L195600	u888	m57	WEIR	I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
L195599	u884	m57	MILLER	Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
L195598	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
L195590	u884	m57	MILLER	The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
L195589	u888	m57	WEIR	Captain Miller, I just want to say...
L196315	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
L196314	u886	m57	SMITH	Where is it, where is it...
L196313	u884	m57	MILLER	Get out of there now!
L196312	u886	m57	SMITH	No, no, we just got her back together...
L196311	u884	m57	MILLER	Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
L196310	u884	m57	MILLER	One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
L196309	u886	m57	SMITH	Come again, Skipper?
L196308	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, get out of there...
L196307	u886	m57	SMITH	I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
L196306	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Smith?
L196305	u886	m57	SMITH	Skipper...
L196286	u884	m57	MILLER	Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
L196285	u886	m57	SMITH	She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
L196284	u884	m57	MILLER	Now what?
L196283	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain, we got a problem.
L196282	u884	m57	MILLER	Thank you.
L196071	u884	m57	MILLER	Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
L196070	u886	m57	SMITH	Sir.
L196064	u884	m57	MILLER	That's enough!
L196063	u886	m57	SMITH	...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
L195939	u886	m57	SMITH	Understood.
L195938	u884	m57	MILLER	We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
L195937	u886	m57	SMITH	I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
L195936	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
L195935	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller, you copy?
L195912	u884	m57	MILLER	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
L195911	u886	m57	SMITH	But...
L195903	u886	m57	SMITH	They're gone.
L195902	u884	m57	MILLER	No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
L195901	u886	m57	SMITH	We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
L195900	u886	m57	SMITH	We don't have time to fart.
L195899	u884	m57	MILLER	Do we have enough time for a weld?
L195897	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a situation here...
L195896	u884	m57	MILLER	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
L195895	u886	m57	SMITH	Captain Miller...
L195744	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, give me a read.
L195743	u886	m57	SMITH	It is now.  We're locked in.
L195735	u886	m57	SMITH	Love to.
L195734	u884	m57	MILLER	Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
L195726	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck...
L195725	u886	m57	SMITH	Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
L195722	u884	m57	MILLER	Where is it?
L195721	u886	m57	SMITH	1500 meters. We're getting too close...
L195717	u884	m57	MILLER	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
L195716	u886	m57	SMITH	We've got some weather.
L195712	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir...!
L195711	u886	m57	SMITH	Yes, sir.
L195710	u884	m57	MILLER	I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
L195709	u886	m57	SMITH	Something like that, yeah.
L195708	u884	m57	MILLER	"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""
L195707	u886	m57	SMITH	That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
L195706	u884	m57	MILLER	We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
L195703	u884	m57	MILLER	Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
L195702	u886	m57	SMITH	We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
L195701	u886	m57	SMITH	One-four degrees...
L195700	u884	m57	MILLER	...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
L195699	u886	m57	SMITH	Heading three-three-four...
L195683	u884	m57	MILLER	What is that?
L195682	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus...
L195579	u886	m57	SMITH	Locked and cocked.
L195578	u884	m57	MILLER	I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
L196395	u884	m57	MILLER	He's dead...
L196394	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir.
L196388	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
L196387	u884	m57	MILLER	...repeat, we're armed...
L196386	u884	m57	MILLER	We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
L196375	u884	m57	MILLER	No. I'll be right back.
L196374	u887	m57	STARCK	I'll do it --
L196369	u884	m57	MILLER	We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
L196368	u887	m57	STARCK	Blow it up?
L196367	u884	m57	MILLER	BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
L196361	u887	m57	STARCK	We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
L196360	u884	m57	MILLER	Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
L196354	u884	m57	MILLER	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
L196353	u887	m57	STARCK	Weir can't be alive.
L196177	u887	m57	STARCK	Five seconds.
L196176	u884	m57	MILLER	Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
L196134	u887	m57	STARCK	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
L196133	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm on my way, Starck.
L196125	u884	m57	MILLER	Stay here! Don't stop working!
L196124	u887	m57	STARCK	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
L196123	u884	m57	MILLER	What?
L196122	u887	m57	STARCK	Justin's in the airlock.
L196121	u884	m57	MILLER	What's going on in there, Starck?
L196120	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, come in...
L196096	u884	m57	MILLER	I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
L196095	u887	m57	STARCK	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
L196094	u884	m57	MILLER	What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
L196093	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
L196092	u884	m57	MILLER	If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
L196091	u887	m57	STARCK	I know that.
L196090	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
L196089	u887	m57	STARCK	It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
L196088	u884	m57	MILLER	We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
L196087	u887	m57	STARCK	I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
L196086	u884	m57	MILLER	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
L196085	u887	m57	STARCK	You've got to listen...
L196083	u887	m57	STARCK	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
L196082	u884	m57	MILLER	Go ahead.
L196081	u887	m57	STARCK	I've got a theory.
L196080	u884	m57	MILLER	...bio-readings of indeterminate origin, don't you have anything useful to tell me?
L196079	u887	m57	STARCK	...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
L196078	u884	m57	MILLER	What is it, Starck?
L196077	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller...
L196052	u884	m57	MILLER	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
L196051	u887	m57	STARCK	Who?
L196050	u884	m57	MILLER	No. It was someone else.
L196049	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe one of the original crew?
L195951	u884	m57	MILLER	Do it. Dr. Weir...
L195950	u887	m57	STARCK	I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
L195949	u884	m57	MILLER	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
L195948	u887	m57	STARCK	What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
L195933	u884	m57	MILLER	So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
L195932	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
L195931	u884	m57	MILLER	What's causing the readings?
L195930	u887	m57	STARCK	"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."
L195929	u884	m57	MILLER	What about the life readings you picked up?
L195928	u887	m57	STARCK	I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
L195927	u884	m57	MILLER	We can take the filters from the Clark...
L195926	u887	m57	STARCK	It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
L195925	u884	m57	MILLER	Carbon dioxide?
L195924	u887	m57	STARCK	Oxygen is not the problem.
L195923	u884	m57	MILLER	How much oh-two do we have?
L195922	u887	m57	STARCK	The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
L195921	u884	m57	MILLER	But you can breathe it.
L195920	u887	m57	STARCK	It tastes bad.
L195917	u884	m57	MILLER	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
L195916	u887	m57	STARCK	We're all here.
L195915	u884	m57	MILLER	Everybody okay?
L195794	u884	m57	MILLER	Keep your eyes open.
L195793	u887	m57	STARCK	That's an affirmative.
L195751	u887	m57	STARCK	There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
L195750	u884	m57	MILLER	Radiation interference?
L195749	u887	m57	STARCK	Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
L195698	u884	m57	MILLER	Come around to three-three-four...
L195697	u887	m57	STARCK	Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
L195635	u884	m57	MILLER	Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
L195634	u887	m57	STARCK	I just finished drying...
L195633	u884	m57	MILLER	Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
L195585	u884	m57	MILLER	Let's go.
L195584	u887	m57	STARCK	Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
L195581	u884	m57	MILLER	Justin?
L195580	u887	m57	STARCK	We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
L196057	u885	m57	PETERS	I've seen bodies before. This is different.
L196056	u888	m57	WEIR	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
L196055	u885	m57	PETERS	About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
L196054	u885	m57	PETERS	I did.
L196053	u888	m57	WEIR	No. I saw nothing.
L195810	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one here.
L195809	u888	m57	WEIR	Can you see a body?
L195808	u885	m57	PETERS	Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
L195807	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
L195804	u888	m57	WEIR	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
L195803	u885	m57	PETERS	Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
L195779	u888	m57	WEIR	They're explosive charges.
L195778	u885	m57	PETERS	Here's another one. They're all over the place.
L195624	u885	m57	PETERS	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
L195623	u888	m57	WEIR	Claire...
L195608	u885	m57	PETERS	They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
L195607	u888	m57	WEIR	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
L195606	u885	m57	PETERS	He served on the Goliath.
L195605	u888	m57	WEIR	He's been past Mars?
L195604	u885	m57	PETERS	Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
L195603	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195602	u885	m57	PETERS	First time in a grav couch?
L196248	u885	m57	PETERS	I don't care.
L196247	u887	m57	STARCK	It's cold.
L196246	u885	m57	PETERS	You got any coffee?
L196164	u887	m57	STARCK	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
L196163	u885	m57	PETERS	We have to do something, oh God...
L196154	u885	m57	PETERS	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
L196153	u887	m57	STARCK	Almost got it.
L196139	u885	m57	PETERS	Do you know what it was?
L196138	u887	m57	STARCK	Keep him talking.
L196137	u885	m57	PETERS	Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
L196129	u885	m57	PETERS	Can you shut it down?
L196128	u887	m57	STARCK	He's engaged the override.
L195786	u887	m57	STARCK	Not according to the computer.
L195785	u885	m57	PETERS	There's no one in the corridor but us.
L196061	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
L196060	u888	m57	WEIR	Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
L196059	u886	m57	SMITH	I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
L195906	u888	m57	WEIR	It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
L195905	u886	m57	SMITH	What?
L195884	u888	m57	WEIR	We're losing atmosphere...
L195883	u886	m57	SMITH	The safety circuit's failed!
L195849	u888	m57	WEIR	That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
L195848	u886	m57	SMITH	What the hell is that?
L195738	u886	m57	SMITH	Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
L195737	u888	m57	WEIR	Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
L195731	u888	m57	WEIR	She's not ugly.
L195730	u886	m57	SMITH	Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
L195715	u886	m57	SMITH	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
L195714	u888	m57	WEIR	Where is she?
L195667	u888	m57	WEIR	"Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from ""point A"" here...  ...to ""point B,"" here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?"
L195666	u886	m57	SMITH	Hey...
L195908	u886	m57	SMITH	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
L195907	u887	m57	STARCK	What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
L195865	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm trying, goddammit --
L195864	u886	m57	SMITH	Get them back --
L195863	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, do you read me, Peters --
L195834	u887	m57	STARCK	Decompression wouldn't do that.
L195833	u886	m57	SMITH	Explosive decompression.
L195832	u887	m57	STARCK	What happened to his eyes?
L195733	u887	m57	STARCK	Picking up magnetic interference.
L195732	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
L195724	u886	m57	SMITH	1000 meters...
L195723	u887	m57	STARCK	The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
L195719	u886	m57	SMITH	Range 3000 meters and closing.
L195718	u887	m57	STARCK	If they are, they're screening their calls.
L195705	u886	m57	SMITH	Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
L195704	u887	m57	STARCK	This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
L195661	u887	m57	STARCK	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
L195660	u886	m57	SMITH	You can't do that.
L195639	u887	m57	STARCK	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
L195638	u886	m57	SMITH	30 hours to Neptune orbit.
L195577	u887	m57	STARCK	Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
L195576	u886	m57	SMITH	I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
L196196	u888	m57	WEIR	It means nothing.
L196195	u887	m57	STARCK	"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"
L196113	u887	m57	STARCK	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
L196112	u888	m57	WEIR	The forward airlock.
L196111	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L196110	u888	m57	WEIR	I'm alright. Please.
L196109	u887	m57	STARCK	In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
L196107	u888	m57	WEIR	It wants me. I have to go.
L196106	u887	m57	STARCK	What are you doing?
L196007	u888	m57	WEIR	No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
L196006	u887	m57	STARCK	Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
L195998	u887	m57	STARCK	I'm sorry.
L195997	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
L195996	u887	m57	STARCK	It must be hard, being so far away from her.
L195995	u888	m57	WEIR	Yes.
L195994	u887	m57	STARCK	Claire is your wife?
L195993	u888	m57	WEIR	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
L195992	u887	m57	STARCK	Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
L195972	u887	m57	STARCK	I can't believe we built this.
L195971	u888	m57	WEIR	That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
L195859	u887	m57	STARCK	I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
L195858	u888	m57	WEIR	What is it?
L195822	u888	m57	WEIR	Ship's log.
L195821	u887	m57	STARCK	What is it?
L195753	u887	m57	STARCK	If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
L195752	u888	m57	WEIR	Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
L195747	u887	m57	STARCK	Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
L195746	u888	m57	WEIR	Do they have pressure?
L195745	u887	m57	STARCK	The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
L195669	u888	m57	WEIR	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
L195668	u887	m57	STARCK	A straight line.
L195664	u888	m57	WEIR	Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
L195663	u887	m57	STARCK	How?
L195662	u888	m57	WEIR	"Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously ""jump"" from one point in the universe to another, light years away."
L203901	u890	m58	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L203900	u889	m58	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L203694	u889	m58	ALICIA	My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L203693	u890	m58	BEN	Those yours too?
L203692	u890	m58	BEN	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
L203691	u889	m58	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L203690	u890	m58	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L203689	u889	m58	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
L203688	u890	m58	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L203562	u890	m58	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L203561	u889	m58	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L203558	u890	m58	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L203557	u889	m58	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L203702	u889	m58	ALICIA	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
L203701	u898	m58	THE THING	I mean...
L203700	u889	m58	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L203699	u898	m58	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
L203697	u898	m58	THE THING	This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
L203696	u889	m58	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L203695	u898	m58	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L203830	u890	m58	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L203829	u897	m58	SUE	Where is Reed?
L203647	u897	m58	SUE	No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L203646	u890	m58	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L203645	u897	m58	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L203644	u890	m58	BEN	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
L203643	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L203604	u897	m58	SUE	What did he do to the uniform?!
L203603	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, he did.
L203602	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't.
L203501	u890	m58	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L203500	u897	m58	SUE	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
L203499	u890	m58	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L203450	u890	m58	BEN	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
L203449	u897	m58	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L203265	u890	m58	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L203264	u897	m58	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L203128	u890	m58	BEN	Is it safe?
L203127	u897	m58	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203091	u897	m58	SUE	Victor did.
L203090	u890	m58	BEN	I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
L203073	u897	m58	SUE	I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203072	u890	m58	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L203798	u890	m58	BEN	And you can? Power it up?
L203797	u899	m58	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L203796	u899	m58	VICTOR	He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
L203795	u890	m58	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L203794	u899	m58	VICTOR	To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
L203793	u890	m58	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L203790	u899	m58	VICTOR	Where do you think? With Sue.
L203789	u890	m58	BEN	What is this? Where's Reed?
L203788	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L203738	u899	m58	VICTOR	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
L203737	u890	m58	BEN	About me? How sweet.
L203736	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L203735	u890	m58	BEN	What are you doing here?
L203546	u890	m58	BEN	I already got it. Everything I want.
L203545	u891	m58	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L203330	u890	m58	BEN	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
L203329	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
L203328	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L203327	u890	m58	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L203326	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Ben?
L203324	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
L203323	u890	m58	BEN	Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
L203114	u891	m58	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L203113	u890	m58	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L203112	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L203111	u890	m58	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L203898	u890	m58	BEN	Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
L203897	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
L203888	u890	m58	BEN	Got it, teach.
L203887	u895	m58	REED	Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
L203754	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L203753	u890	m58	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L203751	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
L203750	u895	m58	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L203749	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
L203748	u895	m58	REED	Ben --
L203629	u895	m58	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L203628	u890	m58	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L203468	u895	m58	REED	O-kay. We'll skip that question.
L203467	u890	m58	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L203466	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L203465	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L203464	u895	m58	REED	Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
L203448	u895	m58	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L203447	u890	m58	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L203413	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L203412	u895	m58	REED	We had a tough year.
L203368	u890	m58	BEN	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
L203367	u895	m58	REED	Ben. Are you okay?
L203366	u890	m58	BEN	What the --!
L203270	u890	m58	BEN	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
L203269	u895	m58	REED	Are you alright?
L203242	u890	m58	BEN	Well maybe you should date him.
L203241	u895	m58	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L203240	u890	m58	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L203239	u895	m58	REED	What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
L203238	u890	m58	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L203237	u895	m58	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L203236	u890	m58	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L203234	u895	m58	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L203233	u890	m58	BEN	Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
L203232	u895	m58	REED	I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L203230	u890	m58	BEN	Solid.
L203229	u895	m58	REED	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L203228	u890	m58	BEN	How long was I out?
L203164	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
L203163	u890	m58	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L203130	u890	m58	BEN	Should?
L203129	u895	m58	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L203110	u895	m58	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L203109	u890	m58	BEN	This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
L203108	u895	m58	REED	He's made a few changes.
L203107	u890	m58	BEN	Isn't that your speech?
L203087	u890	m58	BEN	This makes five.
L203086	u895	m58	REED	I had it at four.
L203085	u890	m58	BEN	Five times.
L203084	u895	m58	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203083	u895	m58	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203082	u890	m58	BEN	They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
L203081	u895	m58	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203080	u890	m58	BEN	No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203079	u895	m58	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203078	u890	m58	BEN	Can't do it. I cannot do it.
L203066	u890	m58	BEN	I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
L203065	u895	m58	REED	We got what we wanted. That's enough.
L203064	u890	m58	BEN	Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
L203063	u895	m58	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203062	u890	m58	BEN	He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203053	u895	m58	REED	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
L203052	u890	m58	BEN	What about his first born?
L203038	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is business. Just work.
L203037	u890	m58	BEN	I can't take this.
L203022	u890	m58	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203021	u895	m58	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203020	u895	m58	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203019	u890	m58	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L203911	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L203910	u890	m58	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L203828	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
L203827	u890	m58	BEN	The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L203765	u890	m58	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L203764	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey! That's a prototype!
L203196	u890	m58	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L203195	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L203194	u890	m58	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L203193	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
L203192	u890	m58	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L203191	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
L203190	u890	m58	BEN	Reed?... Sue?
L203189	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L203188	u890	m58	BEN	Where... where am I?
L203144	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L203143	u890	m58	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L203142	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L203141	u890	m58	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L203140	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L203139	u890	m58	BEN	'Course not. Strictly business.
L203138	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L203122	u890	m58	BEN	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
L203121	u893	m58	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L203116	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L203115	u890	m58	BEN	What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L203519	u899	m58	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L203518	u892	m58	DOCTOR	But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
L203516	u892	m58	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
L203515	u899	m58	VICTOR	What?
L203514	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
L203513	u899	m58	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L203512	u892	m58	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L203511	u899	m58	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L203510	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
L203509	u899	m58	VICTOR	And they're changing into...
L203508	u892	m58	DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
L203251	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	No: You're ON FIRE!
L203250	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Not this again --
L203249	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
L203248	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.
L203247	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
L203246	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Stay right. Left is trouble.
L203245	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L203227	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L203226	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L203225	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L203224	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L203223	u893	m58	JOHNNY	So are you!
L203222	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
L203214	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --"
L203213	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
L203882	u895	m58	REED	Now.
L203881	u893	m58	JOHNNY	But all these people...
L203880	u895	m58	REED	Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
L203639	u895	m58	REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
L203638	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
L203637	u895	m58	REED	You need to control yourself and think before you --
L203550	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L203549	u895	m58	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L203503	u895	m58	REED	They're not costumes.
L203502	u893	m58	JOHNNY	He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
L203472	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L203471	u895	m58	REED	What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L203470	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
L203469	u895	m58	REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
L203462	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
L203461	u895	m58	REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
L203456	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I can go hotter!
L203455	u895	m58	REED	Back it down, Johnny!
L203426	u895	m58	REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
L203425	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
L203424	u895	m58	REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
L203415	u895	m58	REED	Oh, it is.
L203414	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
L203393	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
L203392	u895	m58	REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
L203360	u895	m58	REED	You've been working out.
L203359	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
L203304	u895	m58	REED	Ben, are you there?
L203303	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
L203295	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
L203294	u895	m58	REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203293	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Now what is up with that?
L203186	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Ben! Ben!
L203185	u895	m58	REED	He's not responsive --
L203179	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What about you?
L203178	u895	m58	REED	Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
L203840	u897	m58	SUE	But Johnny... you can't fly.
L203839	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
L203838	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing --
L203825	u897	m58	SUE	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
L203824	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L203772	u897	m58	SUE	As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
L203771	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L203770	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
L203769	u893	m58	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L203768	u897	m58	SUE	"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
L203767	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
L203766	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny? Did you see Ben?
L203635	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!
L203634	u897	m58	SUE	You two need a time-out.
L203627	u897	m58	SUE	"You gave us names? What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
L203626	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L203623	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Dude. That's my sister.
L203622	u897	m58	SUE	I'm driving.
L203610	u897	m58	SUE	Girl...?!
L203609	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
L203460	u897	m58	SUE	That's the temperature of the sun.
L203459	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L203458	u897	m58	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L203457	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
L203423	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L203422	u897	m58	SUE	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
L203421	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L203310	u897	m58	SUE	I think that thing is Ben.
L203309	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What is that thing?
L203302	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"Okay, ""mom."""
L203301	u897	m58	SUE	Stop it.
L203300	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny.
L203299	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
L203297	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me you go silent too.
L203296	u897	m58	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203093	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203092	u897	m58	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L203336	u894	m58	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
L203335	u899	m58	VICTOR	Front page?
L203334	u894	m58	LEONARD	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L203333	u899	m58	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
L203263	u899	m58	VICTOR	"That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not mine."""
L203262	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
L203261	u899	m58	VICTOR	Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
L203260	u894	m58	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L203259	u899	m58	VICTOR	And that's a good thing?
L203258	u894	m58	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L203257	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L203256	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L203255	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L203254	u894	m58	LEONARD	Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L203253	u899	m58	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L203126	u894	m58	LEONARD	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
L203125	u899	m58	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203104	u899	m58	VICTOR	History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203103	u894	m58	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203102	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
L203101	u894	m58	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203100	u899	m58	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203099	u894	m58	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203061	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203060	u894	m58	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203059	u899	m58	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L203904	u897	m58	SUE	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
L203903	u895	m58	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L203885	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203884	u895	m58	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L203779	u897	m58	SUE	You need a doctor.
L203778	u895	m58	REED	The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
L203777	u897	m58	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L203776	u895	m58	REED	I can... make it work.
L203726	u897	m58	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L203725	u895	m58	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L203724	u897	m58	SUE	When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L203723	u897	m58	SUE	I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
L203722	u895	m58	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L203719	u897	m58	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L203718	u895	m58	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L203717	u897	m58	SUE	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L203716	u895	m58	REED	You were?
L203715	u897	m58	SUE	Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
L203714	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
L203713	u895	m58	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L203682	u895	m58	REED	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L203681	u897	m58	SUE	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
L203680	u895	m58	REED	Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
L203679	u897	m58	SUE	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
L203678	u895	m58	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L203677	u897	m58	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L203596	u895	m58	REED	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
L203595	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. How close are we to a cure?
L203531	u895	m58	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
L203530	u897	m58	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
L203529	u895	m58	REED	Of course. Of course.
L203528	u897	m58	SUE	But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
L203527	u895	m58	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L203526	u897	m58	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L203525	u895	m58	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L203524	u895	m58	REED	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L203523	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203494	u897	m58	SUE	No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L203493	u895	m58	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L203492	u897	m58	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L203491	u895	m58	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L203490	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L203489	u895	m58	REED	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
L203488	u897	m58	SUE	Are you kidding?
L203487	u895	m58	REED	I mean, you broke up with me, right?
L203486	u895	m58	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L203485	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L203483	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203482	u895	m58	REED	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
L203481	u897	m58	SUE	Anger. Rage. Frustration.
L203480	u895	m58	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L203479	u897	m58	SUE	Excuse me?
L203478	u895	m58	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L203474	u897	m58	SUE	What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L203473	u895	m58	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L203420	u897	m58	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L203419	u895	m58	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L203418	u897	m58	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L203358	u897	m58	SUE	What...?  Oh.
L203357	u895	m58	REED	Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
L203355	u895	m58	REED	We need to get past them.
L203354	u897	m58	SUE	What?
L203292	u895	m58	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
L203291	u897	m58	SUE	It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203289	u895	m58	REED	Sue... look at your hands.
L203288	u897	m58	SUE	What? What do you mean you --
L203287	u895	m58	REED	Uh, Sue...? I can't.
L203282	u897	m58	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L203281	u895	m58	REED	For science.
L203280	u895	m58	REED	Passion.
L203279	u897	m58	SUE	Which was?
L203278	u895	m58	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L203277	u897	m58	SUE	You're happy for me and Victor.
L203275	u897	m58	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L203274	u895	m58	REED	That's good. That's uh... good.
L203273	u897	m58	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L203272	u895	m58	REED	Feeling better?
L203096	u897	m58	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203095	u895	m58	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
L203077	u897	m58	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
L203076	u895	m58	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203075	u897	m58	SUE	It's been changed.
L203074	u895	m58	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203071	u897	m58	SUE	Right. That's exactly what I meant.
L203070	u895	m58	REED	Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203069	u897	m58	SUE	I was talking about us. Working together.
L203068	u895	m58	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203045	u897	m58	SUE	Never better.
L203044	u895	m58	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L203670	u899	m58	VICTOR	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
L203669	u895	m58	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L203668	u899	m58	VICTOR	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L203667	u895	m58	REED	What are you doing here?
L203443	u899	m58	VICTOR	I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
L203442	u895	m58	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L203441	u899	m58	VICTOR	Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
L203440	u895	m58	REED	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L203439	u899	m58	VICTOR	Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
L203436	u895	m58	REED	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L203435	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L203316	u895	m58	REED	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
L203315	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben did this?
L203314	u895	m58	REED	Ben did this.
L203313	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
L203172	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L203171	u895	m58	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L203168	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L203167	u895	m58	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L203161	u899	m58	VICTOR	So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
L203160	u895	m58	REED	Ben's still out there --
L203159	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
L203158	u895	m58	REED	We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
L203137	u895	m58	REED	Sure.
L203136	u899	m58	VICTOR	Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203058	u895	m58	REED	Hilarious.
L203057	u899	m58	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203051	u899	m58	VICTOR	The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
L203050	u895	m58	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203047	u895	m58	REED	Not at all.
L203046	u899	m58	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203034	u895	m58	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
L203033	u899	m58	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L203577	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
L203576	u899	m58	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L203575	u897	m58	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L203574	u899	m58	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
L203573	u897	m58	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
L203572	u899	m58	VICTOR	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L203571	u897	m58	SUE	He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L203569	u899	m58	VICTOR	Susan. What are you doing?
L203568	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L203567	u899	m58	VICTOR	It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
L203566	u897	m58	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L203431	u899	m58	VICTOR	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
L203430	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L203429	u899	m58	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
L203428	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L203319	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just find him.
L203318	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L203312	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L203311	u899	m58	VICTOR	What's going on?
L203175	u897	m58	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L203174	u899	m58	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L203173	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203155	u899	m58	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L203154	u897	m58	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L203153	u899	m58	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L203152	u897	m58	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L203147	u899	m58	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L203146	u897	m58	SUE	I understand the business reasons.
L203145	u899	m58	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203041	u899	m58	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203040	u897	m58	SUE	It's just business.
L203745	u898	m58	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L203744	u899	m58	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L203743	u898	m58	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L203742	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L203741	u898	m58	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L203740	u899	m58	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L203739	u898	m58	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L222770	u971	m63	CREATURE	Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
L222769	u982	m63	WALTON	What kindness?
L222768	u971	m63	CREATURE	I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
L222766	u971	m63	CREATURE	Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
L222765	u982	m63	WALTON	Then why weep for him?
L222764	u971	m63	CREATURE	And he drove me to mine.
L222763	u982	m63	WALTON	You drove him to his torment.
L222762	u971	m63	CREATURE	I am as he made me. In his own image.
L222761	u982	m63	WALTON	What is that to you? Evil as you are.
L222760	u971	m63	CREATURE	I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
L222759	u971	m63	CREATURE	I was watching.
L222758	u982	m63	WALTON	Yes.
L222757	u971	m63	CREATURE	You were with him at the end.
L222502	u971	m63	CREATURE	I am afraid.
L222501	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	People can be kinder than you think.
L222500	u971	m63	CREATURE	I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
L222499	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Why do you not go to them?
L222498	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes. Very close
L222497	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Friends? Do they live around here?
L222496	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
L222495	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	You're an outcast.
L222493	u971	m63	CREATURE	Worse.
L222492	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	It can't be as bad as that.
L222491	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
L222490	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	Why?
L222489	u971	m63	CREATURE	Better that way... for me.
L222488	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
L222487	u974	m63	GRANDFATHER	The music? Or the fire?
L222486	u971	m63	CREATURE	Nice.
L222739	u980	m63	VICTOR	SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
L222738	u971	m63	CREATURE	GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
L222734	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
L222733	u980	m63	VICTOR	She's not for you.
L222732	u971	m63	CREATURE	She's beautiful.
L222677	u971	m63	CREATURE	That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
L222676	u980	m63	VICTOR	I will not! Kill me now!
L222675	u971	m63	CREATURE	You will honor your promise to me!
L222674	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. I draw the line.
L222673	u971	m63	CREATURE	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
L222672	u980	m63	VICTOR	This was not taken from a grave.
L222671	u971	m63	CREATURE	A brain. Extremities.
L222670	u980	m63	VICTOR	What is this?
L222664	u971	m63	CREATURE	Her body pleases me.
L222663	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why... her?
L222642	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'll be waiting. And watching.
L222641	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes. I want this over and done with.
L222640	u971	m63	CREATURE	Soon?
L222639	u971	m63	CREATURE	We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
L222638	u980	m63	VICTOR	And if I consent?
L222637	u971	m63	CREATURE	I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
L222636	u980	m63	VICTOR	Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
L222635	u971	m63	CREATURE	A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
L222634	u980	m63	VICTOR	Friend?
L222633	u971	m63	CREATURE	There is something I want.  A friend.
L222632	u980	m63	VICTOR	What can I do?
L222631	u971	m63	CREATURE	Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
L222630	u980	m63	VICTOR	I don't know.
L222629	u971	m63	CREATURE	Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
L222628	u980	m63	VICTOR	Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
L222627	u971	m63	CREATURE	In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
L222626	u971	m63	CREATURE	You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
L222625	u980	m63	VICTOR	Materials. Nothing more.
L222624	u971	m63	CREATURE	What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
L222623	u980	m63	VICTOR	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
L222622	u971	m63	CREATURE	Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
L222615	u971	m63	CREATURE	I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
L222614	u980	m63	VICTOR	I see it before me.
L222613	u971	m63	CREATURE	Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
L222612	u980	m63	VICTOR	How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
L222611	u971	m63	CREATURE	Your crime... as well as mine.
L222610	u980	m63	VICTOR	Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
L222609	u971	m63	CREATURE	More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
L222608	u980	m63	VICTOR	Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
L222607	u971	m63	CREATURE	Kill you? Hardly that.
L222606	u980	m63	VICTOR	Kill me and have done with it.
L222605	u971	m63	CREATURE	The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
L222604	u980	m63	VICTOR	How did you find me?
L222603	u971	m63	CREATURE	Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
L222602	u980	m63	VICTOR	You speak.
L222601	u971	m63	CREATURE	Come warm yourself if you like.
L222540	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Fine.
L222539	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Are you all right?
L222388	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
L222387	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
L222386	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
L222385	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I should go. I should leave today.
L222384	u977	m63	JUSTINE	So have I
L222383	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
L222382	u977	m63	JUSTINE	It's been months. It's not like him.
L222381	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Nothing. Still nothing.
L222311	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	"He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a ""pompous...  Fellow..."""
L222310	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Must've been a terrible row.
L222186	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	And you look so lovely.
L222185	u977	m63	JUSTINE	You dance so beautifully together.
L222182	u977	m63	JUSTINE	One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
L222181	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
L222180	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
L222176	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Quite right!
L222175	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
L222170	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	There, there... shhh...
L222169	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Poor William! What indignant tears!
L222545	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It's far too late for him to still be out.
L222544	u973	m63	FATHER	Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
L222543	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Is he not back yet?
L222542	u973	m63	FATHER	Have you seen Willie?
L222527	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
L222526	u973	m63	FATHER	What does it say?
L222313	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
L222312	u973	m63	FATHER	He always was opinionated.
L222713	u980	m63	VICTOR	Open this door for no-one!
L222712	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor!
L222711	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I have been waiting for this ever since.
L222710	u980	m63	VICTOR	I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
L222709	u980	m63	VICTOR	Now husband and wife.
L222708	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister no more.
L222686	u980	m63	VICTOR	I do. But you must trust me for now.
L222685	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
L222684	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
L222683	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
L222682	u980	m63	VICTOR	We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
L222681	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It is
L222680	u980	m63	VICTOR	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
L222679	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Why the change? What about your work?
L222678	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
L222655	u980	m63	VICTOR	A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
L222654	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
L222653	u980	m63	VICTOR	So do I.
L222652	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
L222651	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
L222650	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	What sort of task?
L222644	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'm all right. I'm safe,
L222643	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I thought I'd never see you again!
L222599	u980	m63	VICTOR	I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
L222598	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
L222597	u980	m63	VICTOR	They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
L222596	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
L222595	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've no choice
L222594	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
L222593	u980	m63	VICTOR	My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
L222223	u980	m63	VICTOR	Elizabeth. My more than sister.
L222222	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor. I love you,
L222221	u980	m63	VICTOR	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
L222220	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I give you my soul...
L222219	u980	m63	VICTOR	Your decision. For us.
L222218	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Our decision. Together.
L222217	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Not as weak as I.
L222216	u980	m63	VICTOR	You make me weak.
L222213	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I will be here when you return.
L222212	u980	m63	VICTOR	Only you.
L222211	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
L222210	u980	m63	VICTOR	Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
L222209	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	I wish to be your wife.
L222208	u980	m63	VICTOR	I wish to be your husband.
L222207	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Brother and sister still?
L222206	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Is that what makes it so delicious?
L222205	u980	m63	VICTOR	This feels... incestuous.
L222204	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	All my life I've known.
L222203	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've loved you all my life
L222200	u980	m63	VICTOR	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
L222199	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	You will.  What do you want, Victor?
L222198	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'll have to do better than that.
L222197	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
L222196	u980	m63	VICTOR	And you?
L222195	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Father's so proud.
L222194	u980	m63	VICTOR	Quite a send-off, isn't it?
L222193	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Smell the air. Wonderful.
L222178	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
L222177	u980	m63	VICTOR	Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
L222174	u980	m63	VICTOR	He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
L222173	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
L222172	u980	m63	VICTOR	The world is a dizzying place.
L222171	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
L222167	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
L222166	u980	m63	VICTOR	God took her from us.
L222165	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
L222164	u980	m63	VICTOR	What kind of God is He to will this?
L222163	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
L222162	u980	m63	VICTOR	How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
L222145	u980	m63	VICTOR	Nothing can. Not ever.
L222144	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Are you sure it can't hurt us?
L222142	u972	m63	ELIZABETH	Aren't you?
L222141	u980	m63	VICTOR	Don't cry, Elizabeth.
L222754	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Aye, Captain.
L222753	u982	m63	WALTON	He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
L222752	u975	m63	GRIGORI	This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
L222751	u982	m63	WALTON	A warming wind.
L222109	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
L222108	u982	m63	WALTON	They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
L222107	u975	m63	GRIGORI	Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
L222085	u982	m63	WALTON	It wouldn't dare.
L222084	u975	m63	GRIGORI	It's going to ram us.
L222354	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Oh God.
L222353	u976	m63	HENRY	Professor?
L222337	u976	m63	HENRY	Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
L222336	u981	m63	WALDMAN	No. But someday.
L222335	u976	m63	HENRY	Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
L222334	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
L222333	u976	m63	HENRY	You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
L222332	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
L222745	u976	m63	HENRY	Let it go.
L222744	u980	m63	VICTOR	All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
L222697	u980	m63	VICTOR	I owe you that. Done.
L222696	u976	m63	HENRY	Only if you'll tell me who he is.
L222695	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
L222694	u976	m63	HENRY	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
L222693	u980	m63	VICTOR	Are you sure you'll be all right?
L222646	u980	m63	VICTOR	I didn't find what I was looking for.
L222645	u976	m63	HENRY	What happened up there?
L222553	u980	m63	VICTOR	This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
L222552	u976	m63	HENRY	For what?
L222551	u980	m63	VICTOR	Thank you, Henry.
L222550	u976	m63	HENRY	Quite a place.
L222435	u976	m63	HENRY	Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
L222434	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. They don't.
L222433	u976	m63	HENRY	It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
L222432	u976	m63	HENRY	Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222431	u980	m63	VICTOR	Everything in moderation, Clerval.
L222430	u976	m63	HENRY	We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
L222429	u980	m63	VICTOR	You've been going round-the-clock?
L222428	u976	m63	HENRY	Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
L222427	u980	m63	VICTOR	Is that your diagnosis?
L222426	u976	m63	HENRY	We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
L222425	u980	m63	VICTOR	A... week?
L222424	u976	m63	HENRY	Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
L222401	u980	m63	VICTOR	You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
L222400	u976	m63	HENRY	Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
L222399	u980	m63	VICTOR	Yes? And?
L222398	u976	m63	HENRY	Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
L222397	u980	m63	VICTOR	This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
L222379	u980	m63	VICTOR	Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
L222378	u976	m63	HENRY	How much longer?
L222377	u980	m63	VICTOR	That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
L222376	u976	m63	HENRY	We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
L222375	u980	m63	VICTOR	I've been preoccupied.
L222374	u976	m63	HENRY	Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
L222369	u976	m63	HENRY	There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
L222368	u980	m63	VICTOR	No. He had more important work.
L222367	u976	m63	HENRY	All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
L222366	u980	m63	VICTOR	Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
L222365	u976	m63	HENRY	That's blasphemy!
L222364	u980	m63	VICTOR	I resent God's monopoly.
L222363	u976	m63	HENRY	You can't. Death is God's will!
L222362	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
L222361	u976	m63	HENRY	You're making a scene!
L222360	u980	m63	VICTOR	It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
L222359	u976	m63	HENRY	Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
L222358	u980	m63	VICTOR	Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
L222357	u976	m63	HENRY	They'll hang him all the same.
L222356	u980	m63	VICTOR	He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
L222355	u976	m63	HENRY	They just caught the man who did it.
L222343	u980	m63	VICTOR	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
L222342	u976	m63	HENRY	And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222339	u976	m63	HENRY	Somebody has to!
L222338	u980	m63	VICTOR	Only you would think of that!
L222289	u980	m63	VICTOR	But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
L222288	u976	m63	HENRY	...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
L222287	u980	m63	VICTOR	These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
L222286	u976	m63	HENRY	Now you've got him started.
L222278	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's a letter to my father.
L222277	u976	m63	HENRY	What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
L222276	u980	m63	VICTOR	You're a comfort to me, Henry.
L222275	u976	m63	HENRY	The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
L222263	u976	m63	HENRY	Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
L222262	u980	m63	VICTOR	Quite a few.
L222261	u976	m63	HENRY	Can you think of a better reason?
L222260	u980	m63	VICTOR	Rich old ladies and their daughters?
L222253	u976	m63	HENRY	Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
L222252	u980	m63	VICTOR	Do you really think I'm mad?
L222251	u976	m63	HENRY	I know. You have a way of making an impression.
L222250	u980	m63	VICTOR	Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
L222249	u976	m63	HENRY	Henry Clerval.
L222248	u976	m63	HENRY	Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
L222247	u980	m63	VICTOR	Are you having me on?
L222246	u976	m63	HENRY	As a march hare.
L222245	u980	m63	VICTOR	I am not mad.
L222243	u980	m63	VICTOR	Very well then.
L222242	u976	m63	HENRY	I was just clearing my throat.
L222589	u977	m63	JUSTINE	I have no knowledge of that.
L222588	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
L222587	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
L222586	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
L222585	u977	m63	JUSTINE	I have always loved him.
L222584	u979	m63	PROSECUTOR	And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
L222583	u977	m63	JUSTINE	Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
L222324	u980	m63	VICTOR	Despite the lack of challenge.
L222323	u978	m63	KREMPE	You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
L222239	u978	m63	KREMPE	Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
L222238	u980	m63	VICTOR	Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
L222237	u978	m63	KREMPE	What is your name?
L222236	u980	m63	VICTOR	Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
L222235	u978	m63	KREMPE	Paracelsus?
L222234	u980	m63	VICTOR	Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
L222233	u978	m63	KREMPE	Philosophical?
L222232	u980	m63	VICTOR	But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
L222231	u978	m63	KREMPE	In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
L222341	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
L222340	u980	m63	VICTOR	I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
L222326	u980	m63	VICTOR	The strain was evident.
L222325	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
L222320	u980	m63	VICTOR	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
L222319	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Re-configure the leads?
L222306	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
L222305	u980	m63	VICTOR	Why?
L222304	u981	m63	WALDMAN	"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
L222303	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
L222302	u980	m63	VICTOR	I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
L222301	u981	m63	WALDMAN	It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
L222300	u980	m63	VICTOR	But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
L222299	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
L222298	u980	m63	VICTOR	It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
L222297	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Electricity.
L222294	u981	m63	WALDMAN	I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
L222293	u980	m63	VICTOR	Preposterous.
L222285	u980	m63	VICTOR	No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
L222284	u981	m63	WALDMAN	You disdain accepted wisdom?
L222283	u980	m63	VICTOR	To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
L222282	u981	m63	WALDMAN	You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
L222281	u980	m63	VICTOR	Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
L222280	u981	m63	WALDMAN	Victor, explain yourself.
L222279	u980	m63	VICTOR	Professor Waldman.
L222131	u980	m63	VICTOR	My name is Frankenstein...
L222130	u982	m63	WALTON	Who are you?
L222129	u980	m63	VICTOR	We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
L222128	u982	m63	WALTON	Madness?
L222127	u980	m63	VICTOR	Do you share my madness?
L222126	u982	m63	WALTON	Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
L222125	u980	m63	VICTOR	You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
L222124	u982	m63	WALTON	Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
L222123	u980	m63	VICTOR	Your men are right to be afraid.
L222122	u982	m63	WALTON	You know of it?
L222121	u980	m63	VICTOR	Creature? A... human like creature?
L222120	u982	m63	WALTON	I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
L222119	u980	m63	VICTOR	I heard.
L222118	u982	m63	WALTON	Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
L222117	u980	m63	VICTOR	Ah. An explorer.
L222116	u982	m63	WALTON	There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
L222115	u980	m63	VICTOR	How is it you come to be here?
L222114	u982	m63	WALTON	Are you a physician?
L222113	u980	m63	VICTOR	Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
L222112	u980	m63	VICTOR	I'm... dying.
L222111	u982	m63	WALTON	You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
L225234	u983	m64	ALICE	Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
L225233	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	We should go now.
L225229	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	I will protect you.
L225228	u983	m64	ALICE	The killer is still out there.
L225226	u983	m64	ALICE	Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
L225225	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
L225219	u983	m64	ALICE	No, no, they're all dead...
L225218	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
L225217	u983	m64	ALICE	Jack? Marcie? Ned?
L225216	u990	m64	MRS. VOORHEES	It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
L225215	u983	m64	ALICE	He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
L225146	u983	m64	ALICE	Good night, Brenda.
L225145	u986	m64	BRENDA	Good night, Alice.
L225143	u983	m64	ALICE	I guess...
L225142	u986	m64	BRENDA	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
L225141	u983	m64	ALICE	I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
L225043	u983	m64	ALICE	I was careless.
L225042	u986	m64	BRENDA	Melvin Belli.
L225034	u986	m64	BRENDA	Right! Right!
L225033	u983	m64	ALICE	Tomorrow is another day.
L225032	u986	m64	BRENDA	Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
L224949	u986	m64	BRENDA	I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
L224948	u983	m64	ALICE	What'd you see?
L224906	u983	m64	ALICE	Sure.
L224905	u993	m64	STEVE	I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
L224904	u993	m64	STEVE	Thanks, Alice.
L224903	u983	m64	ALICE	Next Friday.
L224902	u993	m64	STEVE	You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
L224901	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
L224900	u993	m64	STEVE	You want to leave?
L224899	u983	m64	ALICE	Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
L224898	u993	m64	STEVE	Any particular reason?
L224896	u983	m64	ALICE	Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
L224895	u993	m64	STEVE	You draw very well.
L224873	u983	m64	ALICE	You told her to sweep the courts.
L224872	u993	m64	STEVE	That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
L224871	u993	m64	STEVE	Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
L224870	u983	m64	ALICE	Cabin B is ready.
L225202	u985	m64	BILL	It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
L225201	u983	m64	ALICE	Why don't we run? Just run now?
L225200	u985	m64	BILL	Wet. I don't know.
L225199	u983	m64	ALICE	What's the matter with it?
L225197	u985	m64	BILL	No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
L225196	u983	m64	ALICE	Do you have a dime? A quarter?
L225195	u985	m64	BILL	It's dead. Try the pay phone.
L225190	u985	m64	BILL	Hey, guys!
L225189	u983	m64	ALICE	Marcie?
L225188	u985	m64	BILL	Jack?
L225167	u983	m64	ALICE	Okay.
L225166	u985	m64	BILL	I'll go check on Brenda.
L225165	u983	m64	ALICE	They're off now.
L225164	u985	m64	BILL	Where?
L225163	u983	m64	ALICE	Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
L225162	u985	m64	BILL	I'll go take a look.
L225161	u983	m64	ALICE	It sounded like Brenda.
L225160	u985	m64	BILL	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
L225159	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't hear it anymore.
L225148	u983	m64	ALICE	Absolutely.
L225147	u985	m64	BILL	Help you clean up?
L225139	u983	m64	ALICE	Well, it hasn't been that long.
L225138	u985	m64	BILL	Good point.
L225137	u983	m64	ALICE	It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
L225102	u985	m64	BILL	Not if they're where I think they are.
L225101	u983	m64	ALICE	Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
L225007	u983	m64	ALICE	Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
L225006	u985	m64	BILL	Trouble?
L224974	u985	m64	BILL	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
L224973	u983	m64	ALICE	How the... did he get in there?
L224965	u983	m64	ALICE	And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
L224964	u985	m64	BILL	You can only do what you can do.
L224962	u985	m64	BILL	Almost five.
L224961	u983	m64	ALICE	I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
L224953	u983	m64	ALICE	I don't know.
L224952	u985	m64	BILL	What'll you do when you leave here?
L224951	u983	m64	ALICE	I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
L224950	u985	m64	BILL	It still hurts?
L224942	u983	m64	ALICE	Artist.
L224941	u985	m64	BILL	Filmmaker.
L224932	u985	m64	BILL	You're right. It makes no sense.
L224931	u983	m64	ALICE	And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
L224930	u985	m64	BILL	Maybe I can help?
L224929	u983	m64	ALICE	It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
L224928	u985	m64	BILL	How come you're leaving?
L224926	u985	m64	BILL	You okay?
L224925	u983	m64	ALICE	Oh, my God...
L224924	u983	m64	ALICE	Un-hunh.
L224923	u985	m64	BILL	Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
L224883	u983	m64	ALICE	I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
L224882	u985	m64	BILL	You think you're gonna last all summer?
L224881	u983	m64	ALICE	Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
L224880	u985	m64	BILL	Alice? The others show up?
L224878	u985	m64	BILL	I finished the boats.
L224877	u983	m64	ALICE	Steve said for you to start on the boats.
L225068	u983	m64	ALICE	You're welcome.
L225067	u991	m64	NED	I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
L225066	u983	m64	ALICE	Sure.
L225064	u983	m64	ALICE	Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
L225063	u991	m64	NED	I'm sorry.
L224957	u991	m64	NED	Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
L224956	u983	m64	ALICE	I'll be along.
L224911	u991	m64	NED	Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
L224910	u983	m64	ALICE	How come?
L224813	u984	m64	BARRY	I need you so much, Claudette.
L224812	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Let's go back, Barry...
L224811	u984	m64	BARRY	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
L224810	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Somebody's there, Barry.
L224809	u984	m64	BARRY	No, they won't...
L224808	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Somebody'll see.
L224807	u984	m64	BARRY	Claudette...
L224806	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	Oh, you...
L224805	u984	m64	BARRY	I wouldn't know.
L224802	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	I can't, Barry...
L224801	u984	m64	BARRY	You know what I said, though.
L224800	u984	m64	BARRY	I meant everything.
L224799	u987	m64	CLAUDETTE	You said we were special.
L225072	u985	m64	BILL	Where's Ned?
L225071	u988	m64	JACK	You just had some lucky shots.
L225061	u988	m64	JACK	I'll spot you five points.
L225060	u985	m64	BILL	Chance to get even?
L225055	u988	m64	JACK	Get behind him more.
L225054	u985	m64	BILL	Roll him over!
L225051	u985	m64	BILL	Is it stuck?
L225050	u988	m64	JACK	What is it?
L225024	u985	m64	BILL	A short somewhere.
L225023	u988	m64	JACK	Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
L225020	u985	m64	BILL	I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
L225019	u988	m64	JACK	Thanks.
L225018	u985	m64	BILL	I had to.
L225017	u988	m64	JACK	You saved my life.
L225016	u985	m64	BILL	Don't get up. Take a second...
L225015	u988	m64	JACK	I'll be okay. Holy shit...
L225013	u988	m64	JACK	Here we go.
L225012	u985	m64	BILL	This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
L225011	u985	m64	BILL	For sure.
L225010	u988	m64	JACK	Give me a hand?
L224990	u985	m64	BILL	Where'd you get that stuff?
L224989	u988	m64	JACK	What the hell?
L225029	u991	m64	NED	Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."" ""What hath God wrought"" was the telegraph."
L247505	u1031	m67	LUCY	Go in there. Talk to her.
L247504	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Me!? You where the one...
L247503	u1031	m67	LUCY	"All that ""you gotta be vicious"" stuff you filled her head with."
L247502	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	What?
L247501	u1031	m67	LUCY	In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
L247500	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Where's Audrey?
L247499	u1031	m67	LUCY	What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
L247498	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Who the hell are all these people?
L247227	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Great. See ya then.
L247226	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
L247167	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
L247166	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
L247165	u1031	m67	LUCY	I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
L247160	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Big bites.
L247159	u1031	m67	LUCY	Shut up. How can you eat like that?
L247158	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	That's cuz I'm married to you.
L247709	u1025	m67	AUDREY	No.
L247708	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
L247687	u1025	m67	AUDREY	But we can get to the west side faster.
L247686	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
L247685	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The JFK? In the rain!?
L247684	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
L247683	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
L247650	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Oh yes he will.
L247649	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He's not going to do it.
L247616	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Only one way to find out.
L247615	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Think we can fit up in there?
L247587	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
L247586	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Don't you think we have enough?
L247529	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
L247528	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What are you doing?
L247524	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
L247523	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What are you doing?
L247520	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
L247519	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Animal, I can't.
L247518	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
L247517	u1025	m67	AUDREY	My God. He's going after the nest.
L247516	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
L247515	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah. Why are you asking?
L247514	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
L247513	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
L247512	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You made a mistake.
L247511	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
L247510	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	You okay?
L247439	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	We know, Audrey.
L247438	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He stole my report! That's my report!
L247222	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
L247221	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
L247194	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nearly four years...
L247193	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
L247191	u1025	m67	AUDREY	No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
L247190	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	That why you dumped him?
L247170	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Well, I can be tough if I want.
L247169	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
L247168	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
L247164	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
L247163	u1024	m67	ANIMAL	I like that image.
L247720	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, just some insurance guy.
L247719	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Who was that French guy, anyway.
L247677	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Really? I'd like to find out.
L247676	u1034	m67	NICK	You'd be surprised.
L247675	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
L247674	u1034	m67	NICK	Are you okay?
L247659	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Oh my God! They're coming!
L247658	u1034	m67	NICK	If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
L247641	u1034	m67	NICK	Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
L247640	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
L247639	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Our network covers the Ranger games.
L247638	u1034	m67	NICK	How do you know?
L247637	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
L247635	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
L247634	u1034	m67	NICK	Circuits are overloaded.
L247631	u1034	m67	NICK	I was wrong.
L247630	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
L247629	u1034	m67	NICK	What are you doing here?
L247457	u1034	m67	NICK	So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
L247456	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
L247455	u1034	m67	NICK	I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
L247454	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You never said it was off the record.
L247453	u1034	m67	NICK	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
L247452	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
L247387	u1034	m67	NICK	Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
L247386	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nesting?
L247385	u1034	m67	NICK	The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
L247384	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
L247383	u1034	m67	NICK	Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
L247382	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Are you sure?
L247381	u1034	m67	NICK	...he's pregnant.
L247379	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What else do you know about it?
L247378	u1034	m67	NICK	I got pretty close.
L247377	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
L247376	u1034	m67	NICK	Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
L247375	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And you think this creature is one of them?
L247374	u1034	m67	NICK	I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
L247373	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
L247372	u1034	m67	NICK	When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
L247371	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
L247369	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Sure. I'd like that.
L247368	u1034	m67	NICK	Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
L247367	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I'm sorry you feel that way.
L247366	u1034	m67	NICK	Most people don't.
L247365	u1025	m67	AUDREY	That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
L247364	u1034	m67	NICK	You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
L247363	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You're still mad at me, aren't you?
L247362	u1034	m67	NICK	"No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real ""boring"" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises..."
L247361	u1025	m67	AUDREY	So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
L247360	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, well...
L247359	u1034	m67	NICK	You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
L247358	u1025	m67	AUDREY	What?
L247357	u1034	m67	NICK	So you made it.
L247356	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's good to see you, Nick.
L247355	u1034	m67	NICK	Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
L247354	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You must have quite some harem.
L247353	u1034	m67	NICK	I'll take them all.
L247277	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
L247276	u1031	m67	LUCY	Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
L247275	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Wish me luck!
L247266	u1031	m67	LUCY	I left my forgery kit back at the office.
L247265	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
L247264	u1031	m67	LUCY	Your old sweetheart?
L247263	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
L247262	u1031	m67	LUCY	What the hell are you doing?
L247196	u1025	m67	AUDREY	That's the problem. He did.
L247195	u1031	m67	LUCY	Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
L247189	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Nick Tatopoulos.
L247188	u1031	m67	LUCY	Did Romeo have a name?
L247176	u1025	m67	AUDREY	He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
L247175	u1031	m67	LUCY	Who is he?
L247174	u1025	m67	AUDREY	It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
L247162	u1031	m67	LUCY	He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
L247161	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
L247157	u1031	m67	LUCY	Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
L247156	u1025	m67	AUDREY	My life sucks.
L247090	u1031	m67	LUCY	Speak of the devil.
L247089	u1025	m67	AUDREY	And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
L247273	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You're kidding, right?
L247272	u1029	m67	KID	Five bucks.
L247271	u1025	m67	AUDREY	The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
L247270	u1029	m67	KID	What do I get?
L247269	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Can I use some?
L247268	u1029	m67	KID	What's it to you?
L247267	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
L247707	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
L247706	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
L247705	u1025	m67	AUDREY	We? I don't think so.
L247704	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
L247234	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
L247233	u1025	m67	AUDREY	You don't understand, I can get us information...
L247232	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Not now. You got my bag?
L247231	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
L247230	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	What?
L247229	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
L247106	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	It's your choice.
L247105	u1025	m67	AUDREY	I can't.
L247104	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	So have dinner with me tonight.
L247103	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
L247102	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	Call me Charlie.
L247101	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman...
L247100	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	And you're beautiful...
L247099	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, you're married.
L247097	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
L247096	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
L247095	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Just tell me, did you talk with him?
L247094	u1026	m67	CAIMAN	This is not the place...
L247093	u1025	m67	AUDREY	Did you talk with Humphries?
L247446	u1027	m67	ELSIE	I'll try.
L247445	u1034	m67	NICK	Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
L247444	u1034	m67	NICK	Me too.
L247443	u1027	m67	ELSIE	I'm sorry about all this.
L247206	u1034	m67	NICK	I don't think so.
L247205	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
L247153	u1034	m67	NICK	More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
L247152	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Hence the radiation.
L247114	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
L247113	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Well, I think you're cute.
L247112	u1034	m67	NICK	Not for a long time, now.
L247111	u1027	m67	ELSIE	You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
L247110	u1034	m67	NICK	No. Perhaps I work too much.
L247109	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Really? A girlfriend then?
L247108	u1034	m67	NICK	Oh, I'm not married.
L247107	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
L247081	u1027	m67	ELSIE	Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
L247080	u1034	m67	NICK	Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
L247613	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
L247612	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	They didn't make it.
L247611	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Where's Luc and Pierre?
L247610	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	We've secured the doors on both levels.
L247493	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	That is when we will go in.
L247492	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
L247428	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Allez, allez!
L247427	u1028	m67	JEAN-CLAUDE	Merde!
L247298	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
L247297	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	And how should we do that, Sir?
L247296	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Have them sealed off.
L247295	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
L247294	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
L247293	u1030	m67	LT. ANDERSON	When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
L247124	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Get your people out of there or I will.
L247123	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Major, what do you think could have done this?
L247122	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
L247121	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	That is our job.
L247120	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You're fast.
L247119	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
L247117	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	They are with me!
L247116	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
L247436	u1034	m67	NICK	No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
L247435	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You gave them the tape?
L247414	u1034	m67	NICK	It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
L247413	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
L247412	u1034	m67	NICK	No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
L247408	u1034	m67	NICK	Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
L247407	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
L247406	u1034	m67	NICK	Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
L247301	u1034	m67	NICK	When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
L247300	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	What are you suggesting?
L247299	u1034	m67	NICK	You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
L247151	u1034	m67	NICK	What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
L247150	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
L247149	u1034	m67	NICK	The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
L247076	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
L247075	u1034	m67	NICK	Somebody must have seen it.
L247074	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
L247073	u1034	m67	NICK	But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
L247072	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	That's right.
L247071	u1034	m67	NICK	That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
L247068	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	You're standing on it.
L247067	u1034	m67	NICK	What sample?
L247066	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
L247065	u1034	m67	NICK	They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
L247064	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
L247063	u1034	m67	NICK	It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
L247062	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
L247061	u1034	m67	NICK	The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
L247060	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Yeah, you're the worm guy.
L247059	u1034	m67	NICK	Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
L247058	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We know.
L247057	u1034	m67	NICK	Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
L247056	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
L247055	u1034	m67	NICK	You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
L247054	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Follow me.
L247053	u1034	m67	NICK	Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
L247052	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
L247051	u1034	m67	NICK	It's Tatopoulos.
L247050	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
L247604	u1033	m67	MAYOR	You don't have the authority to do that.
L247603	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
L247601	u1033	m67	MAYOR	That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
L247600	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
L247599	u1033	m67	MAYOR	Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
L247405	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
L247404	u1033	m67	MAYOR	Last time you didn't even scratch it!
L247403	u1032	m67	MAJOR HICKS	General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.

L247128	u1035	m67	RAYMOND	Are you looking for this?
L229753	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
L229752	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Don't speak, Quellek.
L229751	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
L229750	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
L229749	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
L229748	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
L229746	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I'm... I'm shot.
L229745	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
L229740	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Open.
L229739	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
L229647	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
L229646	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
L229645	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Quellek. What are you doing in there?
L229644	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
L229345	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Right... Sorry, sir.
L229344	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Uh uh! What did we talk about?
L229343	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
L229342	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Thanks.
L229341	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
L229133	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
L229132	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Is that the bathroom?
L229131	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
L229130	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Where's my bed?
L229129	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
L229128	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	This is it?
L229127	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
L229126	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Just don't.
L229125	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
L229124	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
L229123	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
L229122	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Well good, that's very... nice.
L229121	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
L229847	u1042	m68	JASON	No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
L229846	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...

L229609	u1042	m68	JASON	I had the shot...
L229608	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
L229607	u1042	m68	JASON	"I was staying in character.  ""Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"""
L229606	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Purple skinned monstrosity...?
L229604	u1042	m68	JASON	Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
L229603	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
L229541	u1042	m68	JASON	Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
L229540	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  ""I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.."" ...""Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."""
L229539	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
L229538	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
L229537	u1042	m68	JASON	ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
L229530	u1042	m68	JASON	KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
L229529	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
L229512	u1042	m68	JASON	I heard something. A squeal.
L229511	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Nothing.
L229510	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  What?
L229465	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
L229464	u1042	m68	JASON	You go first! There's no time!
L229463	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Go ahead!
L229390	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Must be some sort of mining facility.
L229389	u1042	m68	JASON	There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
L229378	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	THIS much.
L229377	u1042	m68	JASON	What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
L229376	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	About this much.
L229291	u1042	m68	JASON	KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
L229290	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
L229289	u1042	m68	JASON	NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
L229272	u1042	m68	JASON	Like YOU know?
L229271	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
L229270	u1042	m68	JASON	We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
L229269	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We've got to stop!
L229101	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
L229100	u1042	m68	JASON	At ease men.
L229093	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Just!?
L229092	u1042	m68	JASON	Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
L229044	u1042	m68	JASON	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
L229043	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	God, what an ass.
L228944	u1042	m68	JASON	Leadership....
L228943	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
L228942	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
L228907	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	...Damn you!  Damn you!
L228906	u1042	m68	JASON	The show must go on.
L228905	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I won't and nothing you say-
L228904	u1042	m68	JASON	You WILL go out there.
L228899	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
L228898	u1042	m68	JASON	Come on, old friend...
L229423	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
L229422	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You have a better plan, Alex?
L229421	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
L229385	u1049	m68	TOMMY	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
L229384	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	And note the sucked in gut.
L229368	u1049	m68	TOMMY	"Hey, watch that ""Laredo"" shit."
L229367	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"You think you could do better ""Laredo?"""
L229366	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
L229365	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Shut up.
L229364	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You were holding it upside down weren't you?
L229294	u1049	m68	TOMMY	The engines are dead. We're drifting.
L229293	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	What's happened?
L229283	u1049	m68	TOMMY	They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
L229282	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
L229214	u1049	m68	TOMMY	No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
L229213	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He wants to THINK!?
L229089	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Jason, what have you gotten us into?
L229088	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What the hell is going on?!!?
L228877	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
L228876	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Settle down, Alex...
L228873	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I played Richard III...
L228872	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Not again...
L228861	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
L228860	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a twit!
L229890	u1041	m68	GWEN	He always has to make the big entrance.
L229487	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes you did.
L229486	u1041	m68	GWEN	No I didn't.
L229485	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"Back there. You said ""the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."""
L229484	u1041	m68	GWEN	What?
L229483	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"You said ""the Commander."
L229470	u1041	m68	GWEN	Down there.
L229469	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
L229448	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
L229447	u1041	m68	GWEN	Those blue things ate everybody here?
L229432	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Nobody was WATCHING?
L229431	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know.
L229395	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Could they be the miners?
L229394	u1041	m68	GWEN	Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
L229303	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	To see if there's a pub.
L229302	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex? Where are you going?
L229301	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"Go into the cloud! ...
L229288	u1041	m68	GWEN	FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
L229287	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
L229279	u1041	m68	GWEN	The ships are gaining...
L229278	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	May I get the check?
L229267	u1041	m68	GWEN	Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
L229266	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We heard it the first time!
L229085	u1041	m68	GWEN	All this from watching the.. historical records?
L229084	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh my god, It's real.
L228979	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
L228978	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
L228977	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	A boy comes to the door.
L228976	u1041	m68	GWEN	You could order something in.
L228975	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
L228974	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why didn't you stop at the market?
L228973	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
L228897	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh can't I? Watch me!
L228896	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex you can't -just leave.
L228871	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
L228870	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
L228865	u1041	m68	GWEN	The guy is terminally selfish!
L228864	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a miserable twit!
L229659	u1037	m68	BRANDON	We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
L229658	u1043	m68	KYLE	I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
L229657	u1037	m68	BRANDON	You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
L229656	u1043	m68	KYLE	Oh.  Okay.
L229655	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
L229654	u1043	m68	KYLE	Hi Brandon.
L229036	u1037	m68	BRANDON	He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
L229035	u1043	m68	KYLE	He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
L229765	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
L229764	u1042	m68	JASON	That's It?
L229763	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Raise the glass and push the blue button.
L229762	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
L229730	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
L229729	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  Up?
L229728	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Up.
L229727	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Go. They're off again.
L229725	u1037	m68	BRANDON	GO Commander.
L229724	u1042	m68	JASON	Shit! Go!
L229723	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Lt. Madison, GO.
L229722	u1042	m68	JASON	No, wait, are you-
L229721	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Wait two seconds then go.
L229720	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, now. But-
L229719	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
L229707	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
L229706	u1042	m68	JASON	BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
L229700	u1037	m68	BRANDON	My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
L229699	u1042	m68	JASON	How did you come to that conclusion?
L229698	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
L229697	u1042	m68	JASON	But you don't?
L229696	u1037	m68	BRANDON	It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
L229695	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you mean?
L229694	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
L229693	u1042	m68	JASON	What does the Omega 13 do?
L229692	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander?
L229691	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
L229670	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, that's where you want to be.
L229669	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes...?
L229668	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT?"" Should be down at the far end to your left."
L229667	u1042	m68	JASON	We'd never have the budget for this.
L229666	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
L229665	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
L229664	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay...  Okay, now what.
L229663	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
L229653	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
L229652	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, we got it.
L229642	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
L229641	u1037	m68	BRANDON	I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
L229640	u1042	m68	JASON	It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
L229639	u1037	m68	BRANDON	... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
L229638	u1042	m68	JASON	It's okay. Listen-
L229637	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
L229636	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
L229635	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Brandon.
L229634	u1042	m68	JASON	What's  your name, son?
L229633	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
L229632	u1042	m68	JASON	We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
L229631	u1037	m68	BRANDON	... Yes?
L228970	u1042	m68	JASON	There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
L228969	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes but, we were wondering-
L228968	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
L228967	u1037	m68	BRANDON	"Commander, as I was saying... In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?"
L228949	u1042	m68	JASON	Excuse me guys.
L228948	u1037	m68	BRANDON	"Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-"
L229856	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
L229843	u1041	m68	GWEN	All systems are working, Commander.
L229842	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
L229317	u1041	m68	GWEN	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
L229316	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
L229311	u1041	m68	GWEN	We need another one.
L229310	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
L229307	u1041	m68	GWEN	It's fractured...
L229306	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
L229305	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
L229265	u1041	m68	GWEN	The enemy is matching velocity.
L229264	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The enemy is matching velocity.
L229257	u1041	m68	GWEN	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
L229256	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The ship is sustaining structural damage.
L229142	u1041	m68	GWEN	I never get tired of that joke.
L229141	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	There is no weather in space.
L229140	u1041	m68	GWEN	What's the weather like outside?
L229139	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Yes?
L229138	u1041	m68	GWEN	"I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from ""historical document"" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?"
L228849	u1041	m68	GWEN	We're getting major structural damage.
L228848	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Structural damage at 68 percent.
L229115	u1039	m68	FRED	OK!
L229114	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
L229113	u1039	m68	FRED	Covalent... Right. So...
L229112	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
L229111	u1039	m68	FRED	... What does that mean?
L229110	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
L229109	u1039	m68	FRED	U.... What do you think?
L229554	u1042	m68	JASON	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
L229553	u1039	m68	FRED	As good as Hopkins?
L229549	u1039	m68	FRED	You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
L229548	u1042	m68	JASON	Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
L229546	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
L229545	u1039	m68	FRED	No, I'll kill you. .
L229498	u1042	m68	JASON	I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
L229497	u1039	m68	FRED	Right.
L229496	u1042	m68	JASON	The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
L229427	u1039	m68	FRED	No, no... I'll think on it...
L229426	u1042	m68	JASON	Never mind, Fred....
L229425	u1039	m68	FRED	A hologram...
L229339	u1042	m68	JASON	I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
L229338	u1039	m68	FRED	Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
L229678	u1039	m68	FRED	Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
L229677	u1040	m68	GUY	I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
L229676	u1039	m68	FRED	It's suicide.
L229675	u1040	m68	GUY	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
L229674	u1039	m68	FRED	We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
L229481	u1040	m68	GUY	Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
L229480	u1039	m68	FRED	...The digital conveyor.
L229399	u1040	m68	GUY	I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
L229398	u1039	m68	FRED	You Okay, Alex?
L228930	u1039	m68	FRED	"Oh I make it up. Use lots of ""k""s and ""v""s."
L228929	u1040	m68	GUY	How do you remember this stuff?
L229416	u1040	m68	GUY	We're doing episode 31, Jason?
L229415	u1041	m68	GWEN	How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
L229408	u1041	m68	GWEN	Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
L229407	u1040	m68	GUY	I am SO SICK of being right.
L229401	u1040	m68	GUY	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
L229400	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh, they're so cute.
L229392	u1040	m68	GUY	Something BAD happened here.
L229391	u1041	m68	GWEN	Where are the miners?
L229356	u1040	m68	GUY	"Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just ""CREWMAN #6""!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?"
L229355	u1041	m68	GWEN	Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
L229191	u1041	m68	GWEN	The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
L229190	u1040	m68	GUY	The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
L229082	u1040	m68	GUY	It's ... incredible.
L229081	u1041	m68	GWEN	THAT'S why you built this ship?
L229075	u1041	m68	GWEN	You... know us?
L229074	u1040	m68	GUY	Crewman #6... Call me Guy.
L228923	u1041	m68	GWEN	Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
L228922	u1040	m68	GUY	Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
L229808	u1042	m68	JASON	No. Keep all energy to the armor.
L229807	u1040	m68	GUY	We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
L229536	u1042	m68	JASON	A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
L229535	u1040	m68	GUY	I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
L229420	u1040	m68	GUY	BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
L229419	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
L229418	u1040	m68	GUY	Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
L229417	u1042	m68	JASON	It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
L229388	u1042	m68	JASON	Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
L229387	u1040	m68	GUY	That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
L229370	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
L229369	u1040	m68	GUY	We're screwed... We're so screwed...
L229354	u1040	m68	GUY	No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
L229353	u1042	m68	JASON	It's... I don't know.
L229352	u1040	m68	GUY	Yeah, what is it?
L229351	u1042	m68	JASON	Your last name.
L229350	u1040	m68	GUY	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
L229349	u1042	m68	JASON	Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
L229261	u1042	m68	JASON	"We should have a turbo. I'm always saying ""activate turbo boosters"", right?..."
L229260	u1040	m68	GUY	They're still behind us...
L229240	u1042	m68	JASON	All right. Put me back on with him.
L229239	u1040	m68	GUY	...Okay
L229854	u1049	m68	TOMMY	We made it. Commander, we made it.'
L229853	u1040	m68	GUY	~e're alive!
L229841	u1049	m68	TOMMY	We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
L229840	u1040	m68	GUY	We're alive!
L229442	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I think he just likes pointing at things.
L229441	u1040	m68	GUY	Not a clue. You?
L229440	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
L229430	u1040	m68	GUY	Where'd they go? Back inside?
L229429	u1049	m68	TOMMY	They're gone.
L229414	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
L229413	u1040	m68	GUY	We're doing episode 31?
L229412	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.
L229174	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Hey, YOU want to drive?
L229173	u1040	m68	GUY	More to the left... Stay parallel...
L228921	u1040	m68	GUY	"Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  ""Crewman #6?"""
L228920	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
L228919	u1040	m68	GUY	Hi everybody.
L229824	u1042	m68	JASON	TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
L229823	u1041	m68	GWEN	never doubted you for a second.
L229814	u1042	m68	JASON	Mark 12.
L229813	u1041	m68	GWEN	He's accelerating to Mark 6.
L229718	u1041	m68	GWEN	Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
L229717	u1042	m68	JASON	Because it was on the show!
L229716	u1041	m68	GWEN	We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
L229715	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen...
L229714	u1041	m68	GWEN	What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
L229651	u1041	m68	GWEN	Wait... Jason, Here!...
L229650	u1042	m68	JASON	There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
L229623	u1042	m68	JASON	No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
L229622	u1041	m68	GWEN	Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
L229621	u1042	m68	JASON	Right.
L229620	u1041	m68	GWEN	So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
L229523	u1042	m68	JASON	What the hell are you talking about?
L229522	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
L229520	u1041	m68	GWEN	Turn on the translation circuit.
L229519	u1042	m68	JASON	Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
L229502	u1041	m68	GWEN	Nothing. Hold please.
L229501	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  What did he say?
L229495	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
L229494	u1042	m68	JASON	Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
L229493	u1041	m68	GWEN	Thank God. Are you okay?
L229492	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes. Yes, I'm here!
L229491	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason.. Can you hear me?
L229452	u1042	m68	JASON	Will you stop RIDING ME?!
L229451	u1041	m68	GWEN	Clenched jaw...
L229444	u1042	m68	JASON	It helps.
L229443	u1041	m68	GWEN	How does the rolling help, actually?
L229411	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why does this sound so familiar?
L229410	u1042	m68	JASON	All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
L229383	u1042	m68	JASON	Don't be ridiculous.
L229382	u1041	m68	GWEN	You're playing your good side.
L229373	u1041	m68	GWEN	I could have held on to YOU! ...
L229372	u1042	m68	JASON	Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
L229371	u1041	m68	GWEN	Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
L229315	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229314	u1042	m68	JASON	Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229309	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, can it be repaired?
L229308	u1042	m68	JASON	Can it be repaired?
L229296	u1041	m68	GWEN	No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
L229295	u1042	m68	JASON	Are they behind us?
L229275	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't think that's a cloud...
L229274	u1042	m68	JASON	Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
L229245	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
L229244	u1041	m68	GWEN	"I thought It was the ""We're dead"" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???"
L229243	u1042	m68	JASON	I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
L229238	u1042	m68	JASON	You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
L229237	u1041	m68	GWEN	JASON...
L229236	u1042	m68	JASON	We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
L229235	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason..
L229234	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
L229221	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
L229220	u1041	m68	GWEN	There's nobody here. Jason...
L229212	u1042	m68	JASON	Let me think. I need time to think.
L229211	u1041	m68	GWEN	We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
L229157	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
L229156	u1041	m68	GWEN	We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
L229155	u1042	m68	JASON	Hey... Hey where are you going?
L229154	u1041	m68	GWEN	Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
L229153	u1042	m68	JASON	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
L229152	u1041	m68	GWEN	Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
L229151	u1042	m68	JASON	Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
L229150	u1041	m68	GWEN	Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
L229149	u1042	m68	JASON	Tell them? About...
L229148	u1041	m68	GWEN	Wait. When are you going to tell them?
L229147	u1042	m68	JASON	C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
L229146	u1041	m68	GWEN	On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
L229145	u1042	m68	JASON	But I'm the Commander!
L229144	u1041	m68	GWEN	Only answers to me.
L229143	u1042	m68	JASON	Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
L229137	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
L229136	u1041	m68	GWEN	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
L229135	u1042	m68	JASON	It's Jason...
L229048	u1041	m68	GWEN	You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
L229047	u1042	m68	JASON	This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
L228955	u1042	m68	JASON	You smiled at me.
L228954	u1041	m68	GWEN	What?
L228891	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
L228890	u1041	m68	GWEN	How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
L228889	u1042	m68	JASON	A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
L229880	u1041	m68	GWEN	Tommy, look!  Those lights...
L229800	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Closer?  I can try.
L229799	u1049	m68	TOMMY	JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
L229489	u1041	m68	GWEN	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
L229488	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I heard it too.
L229479	u1041	m68	GWEN	"Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... ""Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"""
L229478	u1049	m68	TOMMY	That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
L229477	u1041	m68	GWEN	We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
L229468	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
L229467	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
L229320	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Sure, no problem.
L229319	u1041	m68	GWEN	I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
L229318	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You know, that's really getting annoying.
L229054	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
L229053	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You should have let me hit him.
L229046	u1041	m68	GWEN	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
L229045	u1049	m68	TOMMY	That's it, It's go time.
L228941	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Almost as much as he loves himself.
L228940	u1041	m68	GWEN	You gotta admit, they do love him.
L228888	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You are so full of shit
L228887	u1041	m68	GWEN	Unbelievable.
L228863	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
L228862	u1041	m68	GWEN	You're kidding. When for?
L228859	u1041	m68	GWEN	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
L228858	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
L229812	u1048	m68	SARRIS	This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
L229811	u1042	m68	JASON	Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
L229584	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
L229583	u1042	m68	JASON	We.. We lie.
L229582	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Simpler.
L229581	u1042	m68	JASON	We pretend...
L229580	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
L229579	u1042	m68	JASON	My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
L229575	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
L229574	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Explain -
L229573	u1042	m68	JASON	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
L229572	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Wait. What did you say?
L229570	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
L229569	u1042	m68	JASON	No! I swear I don't know! Please!
L229568	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Prepare a tear harness for the female...
L229567	u1042	m68	JASON	Stop, please! I don't know!
L229566	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
L229565	u1042	m68	JASON	I don't know.
L229564	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
L229563	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes.
L229233	u1042	m68	JASON	All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
L229232	u1048	m68	SARRIS	You have ten seconds.
L229231	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
L229230	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
L229229	u1042	m68	JASON	Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
L229228	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
L229227	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
L229011	u1042	m68	JASON	Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
L229010	u1048	m68	SARRIS	First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
L229834	u1042	m68	JASON	You can oc that?
L229833	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
L229591	u1042	m68	JASON	It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
L229590	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But...Why?
L229589	u1042	m68	JASON	Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
L229588	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But... Inside, I have seen-
L229587	u1042	m68	JASON	A model, only as big as this.
L229586	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But there it is!...
L229585	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
L229336	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
L229335	u1042	m68	JASON	Well... Sort of...
L229334	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	"Deception... ""Lies."""
L229323	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
L229322	u1042	m68	JASON	You what?.. What are you talking about?
L229321	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
L229277	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
L229276	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar? What is that?
L229217	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
L229216	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander...
L229205	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
L229204	u1042	m68	JASON	Former Commander?
L229203	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Our former Commander was not... Strong.
L229202	u1042	m68	JASON	Then how did he find out about the device?
L229201	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	NO, Thank God he has not.
L229200	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
L229179	u1042	m68	JASON	Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
L229178	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
L229096	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	... Maintenance facility...
L229095	u1042	m68	JASON	It's perfectly safe. I promise.
L229094	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Weapons storage...
L229027	u1042	m68	JASON	It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
L229026	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
L229025	u1042	m68	JASON	Thanks
L229024	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	An interstellar vox.
L229023	u1042	m68	JASON	I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
L229022	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
L229021	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
L229020	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But what if Sarris survives?
L229019	u1042	m68	JASON	Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
L229018	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Theramin.
L229017	u1042	m68	JASON	Right. Long live... What's your planet?
L229016	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
L229015	u1042	m68	JASON	"Yeah. ""Earth."" Time to get back to ""Earth,"" kids."
L229014	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	You... You mean Earth?
L229013	u1042	m68	JASON	Home.
L229012	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander?... Where are you... going?
L229000	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	As you wish.
L228999	u1042	m68	JASON	Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
L228998	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
L228983	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
L228982	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
L228959	u1042	m68	JASON	Catch me later, okay?
L228958	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	I... certainly, but-
L228957	u1042	m68	JASON	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
L228956	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
L229879	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
L229878	u1042	m68	JASON	Hold course, Laredo!
L229839	u1042	m68	JASON	Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
L229838	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Commander?... Call me Laredo?
L229837	u1042	m68	JASON	Let's do it, Tommy.
L229794	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Pedal to the metal...
L229793	u1042	m68	JASON	Pedal to the metal Tommy...
L229618	u1042	m68	JASON	Practice driving, Tommy.
L229617	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
L229616	u1042	m68	JASON	All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
L229558	u1042	m68	JASON	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
L229557	u1049	m68	TOMMY	NO NO NO.
L229534	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
L229533	u1049	m68	TOMMY	The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
L229532	u1042	m68	JASON	It doesn't have eyes.
L229531	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
L229508	u1042	m68	JASON	Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
L229507	u1049	m68	TOMMY	How about the pig-lizard?
L229506	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay... On what?
L229461	u1042	m68	JASON	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
L229460	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Sorry Guys... It just went off.
L229439	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, let's go.
L229438	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh, right, sorry.
L229437	u1042	m68	JASON	Tommy, we have these...
L229436	u1049	m68	TOMMY	"Okay, I'll do this...  ""Caw Caw!"""
L229435	u1042	m68	JASON	Anything.
L229434	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What kind of signal?
L229433	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
L229281	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh god...
L229280	u1042	m68	JASON	Do your best, Tommy...
L229263	u1042	m68	JASON	Push It. Hold it down.
L229262	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Could be this.
L229259	u1049	m68	TOMMY	It's as far as it goes!
L229258	u1042	m68	JASON	Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
L229254	u1042	m68	JASON	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
L229253	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Where?
L229197	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Why don't you just turn it on and see?
L229196	u1042	m68	JASON	Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
L229170	u1042	m68	JASON	They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
L229169	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Excuse me?
L229161	u1042	m68	JASON	I think we're going to exit the space port.
L229160	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What's going on?
L229071	u1042	m68	JASON	Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
L229070	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Wh... Where are we?
L229069	u1042	m68	JASON	That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
L228946	u1042	m68	JASON	And determination.
L228945	u1049	m68	TOMMY	... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
L228886	u1042	m68	JASON	"I didn't say that.  I said ""wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together."" That's what I said."
L228885	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
L229806	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
L229805	u1044	m68	LATHE	Because they're coming right at us.
L229804	u1048	m68	SARRIS	WHAT? WH
L229803	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Get oacK on their tail.
L229802	u1044	m68	LATHE	enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
L229686	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Find them.
L229685	u1044	m68	LATHE	But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
L229684	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Find them.
L229595	u1044	m68	LATHE	The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
L229594	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
L229285	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Patience, Lt. . Patience.
L229284	u1044	m68	LATHE	Continue forward, sir?
L239472	u1120	m74	DANA	I'd rather not.
L239471	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
L239470	u1120	m74	DANA	I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
L239469	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
L239468	u1120	m74	DANA	We don't have a relationship.
L239467	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
L239370	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
L239369	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
L239368	u1120	m74	DANA	Everybody has a choice.
L239367	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
L239366	u1120	m74	DANA	If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
L239365	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
L239364	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you want with my baby?
L239083	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
L239082	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
L238961	u1120	m74	DANA	Good night, Janosz.
L238960	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
L238959	u1120	m74	DANA	No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
L238958	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
L238956	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
L238955	u1120	m74	DANA	Janosz?
L238809	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
L238808	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
L238807	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
L238806	u1120	m74	DANA	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
L238805	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
L238804	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
L238803	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
L238802	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
L238836	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.
L238835	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I won't.
L238834	u1120	m74	DANA	Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
L238833	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Certainly.
L238832	u1120	m74	DANA	This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
L238827	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No.  Not that I can recall.
L238826	u1120	m74	DANA	Does he ever mention me?
L238825	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
L238824	u1120	m74	DANA	How is he these days?
L238823	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Occasionally
L238822	u1120	m74	DANA	Do you ever see him?
L238821	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Oh no.
L238820	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
L238819	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
L238817	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
L238816	u1120	m74	DANA	What are you working on, Egon?
L238813	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
L238812	u1120	m74	DANA	Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
L238747	u1120	m74	DANA	That's exactly what you said last week.
L238746	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, that's no problem.
L238745	u1120	m74	DANA	No, you didn't, Frank.
L238744	u1122	m74	FRANK	Didn't I do it?
L238743	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
L238742	u1122	m74	FRANK	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
L238741	u1122	m74	FRANK	Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
L238740	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
L238739	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
L238738	u1120	m74	DANA	You're also a human being, Frank.
L238737	u1122	m74	FRANK	I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
L238736	u1120	m74	DANA	Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
L239537	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
L239536	u1120	m74	DANA	That's a terrible thing to say.
L239533	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Same difference.
L239532	u1120	m74	DANA	That's not true.  It was 1620.
L239500	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finally came to your senses, huh?
L239499	u1120	m74	DANA	I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
L239272	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
L239271	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe I should call Janine.
L239270	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Let me jingle you right now.
L239269	u1120	m74	DANA	So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
L239268	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
L239267	u1120	m74	DANA	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
L239266	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm not even good for me.
L239265	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
L239264	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
L239263	u1120	m74	DANA	For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
L239262	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
L239261	u1120	m74	DANA	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
L239260	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
L239224	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
L239223	u1120	m74	DANA	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
L239222	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
L239221	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
L239220	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
L239219	u1120	m74	DANA	Does she know anything about babies?
L239218	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
L239217	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
L239216	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
L239215	u1120	m74	DANA	They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
L239213	u1120	m74	DANA	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
L239212	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you all squeaky clean now?
L239153	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
L239152	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
L239151	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Or we could do that.
L239150	u1120	m74	DANA	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
L239149	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
L239148	u1120	m74	DANA	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
L239147	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
L239145	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
L239144	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
L239141	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
L239140	u1120	m74	DANA	It was full of this awful pink ooze.
L239139	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
L239138	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, what about the bathtub?
L239137	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
L239135	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
L239134	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't know what to do anymore.
L239133	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
L239132	u1120	m74	DANA	I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
L239131	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
L239130	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
L239129	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
L239128	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
L239097	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
L239096	u1120	m74	DANA	Good-bye, Peter.
L239095	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
L239090	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
L239089	u1120	m74	DANA	He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
L239081	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
L239080	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
L239078	u1120	m74	DANA	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
L239077	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're really good, you know.
L239076	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, hello, Peter.
L239075	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So this is what you do, huh?
L238974	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thanks.
L238973	u1120	m74	DANA	Good luck.
L238972	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
L238971	u1120	m74	DANA	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
L238970	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
L238969	u1120	m74	DANA	Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
L238968	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
L238967	u1120	m74	DANA	I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
L238903	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, let's take a look.
L238902	u1120	m74	DANA	That's where the buggy stopped.
L238901	u1120	m74	DANA	We definitely had a moment or two.
L238900	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
L238894	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll supervise.
L238893	u1120	m74	DANA	I'll do it.
L238892	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
L238891	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
L238890	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oscar!  You poor kid!
L238889	u1120	m74	DANA	His name is Oscar.
L238888	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
L238887	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you think?
L238881	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
L238880	u1120	m74	DANA	"Well, when you started introducing me as ""the old ball and chain,"" that's when I left."
L238879	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
L238878	u1120	m74	DANA	You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
L238877	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
L238876	u1120	m74	DANA	"He didn't ""ditch"" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it."
L238875	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
L238874	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
L238873	u1120	m74	DANA	I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
L238872	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
L238871	u1120	m74	DANA	Hello, Peter.
L239299	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
L239298	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Sorry!
L238913	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
L238912	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
L238905	u1120	m74	DANA	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
L238904	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Is this the spot?
L238868	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Egon.
L238867	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
L238866	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
L238784	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
L238783	u1121	m74	ELAINE	It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
L238782	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
L238781	u1121	m74	ELAINE	I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
L238780	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
L238779	u1121	m74	ELAINE	According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
L239435	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
L239434	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
L239345	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you're talking.
L239344	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
L239343	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
L239342	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	That's quite a story.
L238799	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
L238798	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
L238797	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
L238796	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
L238795	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
L238794	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
L238793	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Can I help you?
L239454	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
L239453	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
L239452	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
L239327	u1127	m74	LOUIS	You're right.  We should stay.
L239326	u1124	m74	JANINE	I don't think we should leave her alone.
L239325	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Should we go?
L239280	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Tonight?
L239279	u1124	m74	JANINE	Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
L239278	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay.
L239277	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
L239276	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
L239275	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
L239274	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
L239273	u1124	m74	JANINE	I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
L239240	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, sure, that sounds great.
L239239	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
L239238	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
L239237	u1124	m74	JANINE	Well, good night, Louis.
L239236	u1124	m74	JANINE	That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
L239235	u1127	m74	LOUIS	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
L239234	u1124	m74	JANINE	Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
L239233	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
L239232	u1124	m74	JANINE	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
L239231	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239230	u1124	m74	JANINE	What are you doing up here?
L239229	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
L239048	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Ghostbusters.
L239047	u1124	m74	JANINE	Who are you going to call?
L239046	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
L239045	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
L239044	u1127	m74	LOUIS	What is it, honey?
L239486	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
L239485	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
L239194	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
L239193	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
L239184	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
L239183	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
L239182	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is the one that looked at Dana.
L239178	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	The Upper West Side.
L239177	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
L239175	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
L239174	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Then why have you come?
L239173	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I know.
L239172	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
L239094	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	My pleasure.
L239093	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
L239092	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
L239091	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
L239087	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Too bad for the Moldavians.
L239086	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
L239085	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
L239084	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
L239336	u1134	m74	VIGO	So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
L239335	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
L239334	u1134	m74	VIGO	The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
L239333	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I await the word of Vigo.
L239332	u1134	m74	VIGO	I command you.
L239331	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	-- the sorrow --
L239330	u1134	m74	VIGO	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
L239329	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Yes, the scourge --
L239328	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
L238917	u1134	m74	VIGO	On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
L238916	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Command me, lord.
L238915	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
L239029	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to stop them.  Please!
L239028	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	These boys aren't playing around.
L239027	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Maybe they just want to appeal.
L239026	u1126	m74	JUDGE	They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
L239025	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who are they?
L239024	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to do something!
L239005	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
L239004	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
L239018	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Did I forget something?
L239017	u1126	m74	JUDGE	That's it?  That's all you have to say?
L239015	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
L239014	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Get on with it, counselor!
L239013	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Can I have some of your water?
L239012	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Yes.
L239011	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
L238999	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Do I?
L238998	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
L238995	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
L238994	u1126	m74	JUDGE	The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
L239410	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
L239409	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239408	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
L239407	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
L239406	u1127	m74	LOUIS	This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
L239390	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
L239389	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
L239388	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
L239387	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
L239386	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	You were the one who got me in.
L239385	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
L239384	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Like what?
L239383	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
L239382	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
L239381	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
L239380	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
L239379	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
L238778	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
L238777	u1128	m74	MILTON	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
L238776	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
L238775	u1128	m74	MILTON	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
L238774	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
L238773	u1128	m74	MILTON	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
L238772	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
L239009	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
L239008	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
L239007	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
L239006	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
L239003	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
L239002	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
L238997	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
L238996	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
L239527	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
L239526	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
L239525	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	From where -- Neptune?
L239524	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
L239523	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Pretty impressive, huh?
L239476	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
L239475	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So far so good.
L239474	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
L239473	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
L239301	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
L239300	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
L239245	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
L239244	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
L239163	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
L239162	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""
L239157	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
L239156	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --
L238930	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You need the exercise.
L238929	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You were supposed to help me with this.
L238911	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I knew that.
L238910	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	That's a thousand million electron volts.
L238899	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
L238898	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
L238897	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What now, Brainiac?
L238884	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
L238883	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'd like to have a stool specimen
L238855	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't even want to know where that is.
L238854	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
L238853	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
L238852	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Hello, Venkman.
L238851	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Egon!
L239491	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Do it!  Just do it!
L239490	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
L239431	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Something good --
L239430	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
L239429	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
L239428	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
L239427	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
L239286	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
L239285	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
L239255	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Nine feet -- ten --
L239254	u1132	m74	STANTZ	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
L239253	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Six feet -- seven -- eight --
L239161	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, ""Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."""
L239160	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"No, not exactly a man of the people.  ""Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."""
L239052	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And we're the ...
L239051	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm Egon --
L238989	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
L238988	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
L238964	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
L238963	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
L238941	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	What's the reading?
L238940	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
L238939	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
L238907	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
L238906	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Not a trace.
L238844	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Good idea.
L238843	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
L238842	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
L238841	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
L238840	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Who was that?
L239508	u1135	m74	WINSTON	There's something very familiar about this painting.
L239507	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
L239297	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
L239296	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Rivers of the stuff!
L239257	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No, the slime is rising.
L239256	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Is the line sinking?
L239196	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
L239195	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
L239111	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
L239110	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
L239535	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
L239534	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What's your story, Pete?
L239529	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
L239528	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
L239520	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
L239519	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
L239488	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
L239487	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
L239480	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	She's new in town.
L239479	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My Fault!
L239478	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
L239477	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
L239466	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
L239465	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
L239450	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
L239449	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
L239426	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
L239425	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
L239416	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I hate Jello.
L239415	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It looks like a giant Jello mold.
L239295	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
L239294	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
L239293	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
L239249	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
L239248	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
L239243	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
L239242	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
L239241	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
L239206	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
L239205	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What happened?
L239186	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll get one more reading.
L239185	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
L239155	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
L239154	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you find anything at Dana's?
L239116	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
L239115	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
L239114	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What kind of tests?
L239113	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
L239112	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Like a goat on garbage.
L239109	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
L239108	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
L239107	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is what you do with your spare time?
L239102	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
L239101	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And now you're going to eat it?
L239099	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
L239098	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
L239065	u1132	m74	STANTZ	If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
L239064	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
L239057	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
L239056	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
L239055	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
L239050	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm Peter --
L239049	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'm Ray --
L239034	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
L239033	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
L238920	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
L238919	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
L238918	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
L238909	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
L238908	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What's that?
L238896	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
L238895	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, Holmes, what do you think?
L238865	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Dana!  Dana Barrett!
L238864	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who, Ray?
L238863	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
L238862	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?  Who?  Who?
L238861	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Ray --
L238860	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
L238859	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?
L238858	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
L238857	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Great.  So what are you guys working on?
L238850	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
L238849	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
L238848	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
L238847	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So, no goat hooves, huh?
L238846	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, hiya, Pete.
L238845	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
L239494	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
L239493	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
L239459	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
L239458	u1132	m74	STANTZ	She's moving!
L239289	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
L239288	u1135	m74	WINSTON	What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
L239284	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
L239283	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
L239282	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
L239281	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
L239208	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
L239207	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?
L239202	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well don't think!
L239201	u1135	m74	WINSTON	No, I just thought --
L239200	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Are you telling me how to drive?
L239192	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
L239191	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
L239190	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What?  Yeah.
L239189	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You finished here?
L239188	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Huh?  What?
L239187	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Now that's one ugly dude.
L239171	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal ""Stabilize -- All Clear."""
L239170	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You got a flux and a half.
L239159	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
L239158	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
L239119	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
L239118	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Does it have any favorites?
L238771	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
L238770	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
L238769	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
L238768	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
L238767	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
L238766	u1135	m74	WINSTON	That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
L238755	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Then let's do it.
L238754	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'm ready.
L238753	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ready?
L239531	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
L239530	u1135	m74	WINSTON	My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
L239463	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
L239462	u1135	m74	WINSTON	How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
L239447	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
L239446	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Wonder what?
L239445	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
L239433	u1135	m74	WINSTON	And decent.
L239432	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And pure --
L239374	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
L239373	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
L239340	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
L239339	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Tell him about the toaster.
L239123	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So we'll put a warning on the label.
L239122	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
L239121	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
L239796	u1136	m75	BRIDE	What's the matter, dear?
L239795	u1141	m75	GROOM	Uuuuuuugh!!
L239794	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
L239792	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Have I done the right thing?
L239791	u1141	m75	GROOM	To the bathroom, where do you think?
L239790	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Now where are you going?
L239789	u1136	m75	BRIDE	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
L239788	u1141	m75	GROOM	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
L239787	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Roy?  Your clock broke.
L239785	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Well, thanks a lot.
L239784	u1141	m75	GROOM	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
L239783	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Aren't you glad we waited?
L239577	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I was just going to say ""eight.""  You're fantastic!"
L239576	u1137	m75	COED	Eight o'clock?
L239575	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
L239569	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
L239568	u1137	m75	COED	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
L239567	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
L239554	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
L239553	u1137	m75	COED	No.  They're just coming to me.
L239552	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
L239551	u1137	m75	COED	Ummm -- figure eight?
L239550	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ready?  What is it?
L239546	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
L239545	u1137	m75	COED	Is it a star?
L240310	u1138	m75	DANA	All right, what happened to me?
L240309	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
L240308	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
L240220	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.
L240219	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Are you the Gatekeeper?
L240015	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I got the Twister game for later ...
L240014	u1138	m75	DANA	Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
L240013	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
L240012	u1138	m75	DANA	Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
L240011	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
L240010	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L240009	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you.
L239676	u1138	m75	DANA	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
L239675	u1144	m75	LOUIS	You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
L239674	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
L239673	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
L239672	u1138	m75	DANA	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
L239671	u1144	m75	LOUIS	"Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped ""20 Minute Workout"" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
L239670	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you sick, Louis?
L239669	u1144	m75	LOUIS	... I thought it was the drug store.
L239668	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L239667	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you ...
L240316	u1138	m75	DANA	Talk to my accountant. 
L240315	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
L240314	u1138	m75	DANA	Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
L240313	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
L240312	u1138	m75	DANA	Really!  Is it gone?
L240311	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
L240064	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Whoa!! Nice voice.
L240063	u1138	m75	DANA	There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
L240062	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
L240061	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am ...
L240060	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
L240059	u1138	m75	DANA	I want you inside me.
L240058	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
L240056	u1138	m75	DANA	Take me now.
L240055	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
L240054	u1138	m75	DANA	Do you want this body?
L240053	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
L240052	u1138	m75	DANA	He is the Destructor.
L240051	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
L240050	u1138	m75	DANA	We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
L240048	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
L240047	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
L239944	u1138	m75	DANA	I've got to go now.
L239943	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
L239942	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  Since you put it that way.
L239941	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
L239940	u1138	m75	DANA	I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
L239939	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
L239938	u1138	m75	DANA	What's he doing in my refrigerator.
L239937	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
L239936	u1138	m75	DANA	"Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."""
L239935	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
L239934	u1138	m75	DANA	You must have gotten the last copy.
L239933	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."
L239932	u1138	m75	DANA	Can't you tell me now?
L239931	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
L239930	u1138	m75	DANA	He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
L239929	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Is he dying or something?
L239928	u1138	m75	DANA	"The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man."
L239927	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who's the stiff?
L239926	u1138	m75	DANA	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
L239925	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
L239924	u1138	m75	DANA	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
L239923	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're the best one in your row.
L239922	u1138	m75	DANA	You heard it?
L239921	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great rehearsal.
L239776	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No kiss?
L239775	u1138	m75	DANA	Goodbye.
L239774	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Then I'll go.
L239773	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.
L239772	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
L239771	u1138	m75	DANA	Then leave.
L239770	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Don't scream.
L239769	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll scream.
L239768	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I want to help you.
L239767	u1138	m75	DANA	Out!
L239766	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On a purely scientific basis.
L239765	u1138	m75	DANA	That's it.  Get out.
L239764	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I think I should spend the night here.
L239763	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  What do you want to do?
L239762	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
L239761	u1138	m75	DANA	Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
L239760	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
L239759	u1138	m75	DANA	This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
L239758	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
L239757	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.
L239756	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you all right?
L239755	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Damn!
L239753	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I know.  It happened by itself.
L239752	u1138	m75	DANA	I told you, I ...
L239751	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're quite a housekeeper.
L239750	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
L239749	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, let's check it out.
L239748	u1138	m75	DANA	Uh-huh.
L239747	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
L239746	u1138	m75	DANA	What?
L239745	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	That's too bad.
L239743	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Thanks.  What's in there?
L239742	u1138	m75	DANA	Like a used car salesman.
L239741	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No?  What do I act like?
L239740	u1138	m75	DANA	You really don't act like a scientist.
L239739	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
L239738	u1138	m75	DANA	That's a violin concerto.
L239737	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
L239736	u1138	m75	DANA	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
L239735	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
L239734	u1138	m75	DANA	No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
L239733	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
L239732	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"Spengler,  see if you can find the word ""Zuul"" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
L239731	u1138	m75	DANA	No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
L239728	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's in the stars.
L239727	u1138	m75	DANA	Is that your professional opinion?
L239720	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
L239719	u1138	m75	DANA	Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
L239715	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So what do you think it was?
L239714	u1138	m75	DANA	... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
L239711	u1138	m75	DANA	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
L239710	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We're all professionals here, Miss ...
L239709	u1138	m75	DANA	Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
L239708	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
L239640	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I see.
L239639	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	"Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of ""dodge"" or ""hustle.""  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."
L239638	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But why?  The students love us!
L239637	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
L239636	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
L239635	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
L239634	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
L240323	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	That would definitely explain it.
L240322	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
L240321	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
L240320	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
L240319	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
L240032	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
L240031	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
L240030	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	That is one speedy mutt.
L239621	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We'll get back to you.
L239620	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Did you see it?  What was it?
L239602	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
L239601	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	What's that got to do with it?
L239593	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
L239592	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
L239591	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
L239590	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
L240232	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Thank you.
L240231	u1143	m75	JANINE	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
L240230	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't believe in luck.
L240229	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
L240228	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240227	u1143	m75	JANINE	I want you to have this. 
L240118	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's so romantic.
L240117	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
L240116	u1143	m75	JANINE	In the physical sense.
L240115	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Die in what sense?
L240114	u1143	m75	JANINE	Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
L239707	u1143	m75	JANINE	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
L239706	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I think it's the food of the future.
L239705	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, that's very - unusual.
L239704	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I collect spores, molds and fungus.
L239703	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
L239702	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Is that a game?
L239701	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
L239700	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Print is dead.
L239699	u1143	m75	JANINE	You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
L239966	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
L239965	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
L239964	u1143	m75	JANINE	I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
L239963	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The EPA?  What's he want?
L239962	u1143	m75	JANINE	And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
L239958	u1143	m75	JANINE	Here are tonight's calls.
L239957	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
L239713	u1143	m75	JANINE	What calls?
L239712	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
L239805	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
L239804	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
L239803	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Did you ever report it to anyone?
L239802	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
L239801	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Has this ever happened before?
L239800	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
L240208	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
L240207	u1146	m75	PECK	"That's ""Peck!"""
L240206	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
L240197	u1146	m75	PECK	Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
L240196	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
L240157	u1146	m75	PECK	See!  They are using drugs.
L240156	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
L240132	u1146	m75	PECK	Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
L240131	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
L239995	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
L239994	u1146	m75	PECK	Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
L239993	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
L239992	u1146	m75	PECK	Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
L239991	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why do you want to see it?
L239990	u1146	m75	PECK	May I please see the storage facility?
L239989	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"The magic word is ""please."""
L239988	u1146	m75	PECK	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
L239987	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Because you didn't say the magic word.
L239986	u1146	m75	PECK	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
L239985	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No, you may not.
L239984	u1146	m75	PECK	And may I see this storage facility?
L239983	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, it would.
L239982	u1146	m75	PECK	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
L239981	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	In a storage facility.
L239980	u1146	m75	PECK	And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
L239979	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm not at liberty to say.
L239978	u1146	m75	PECK	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
L239977	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You could say that.
L239976	u1146	m75	PECK	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
L239975	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
L239974	u1146	m75	PECK	Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
L239973	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
L239972	u1146	m75	PECK	Are you Peter Venkman?
L239971	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  How's it going?
L239970	u1146	m75	PECK	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
L239969	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Can I help you?
L239565	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Then my theory was correct.
L239564	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
L239563	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
L239562	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
L239561	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
L239560	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
L239559	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sorry.  This isn't your day.
L239558	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Two wavy lines?
L239557	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
L239556	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yes.  I don't like this.
L239555	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nervous?
L239549	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Close -- but definitely wrong.
L239548	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Circle?
L239543	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good guess -- but no.
L239542	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	A square?
L239541	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	All right.  What is it?
L239902	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wow!
L239901	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
L239900	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
L239899	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
L239898	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
L239897	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
L239896	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
L239828	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
L239827	u1154	m75	WOMAN	You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
L239826	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
L239825	u1154	m75	WOMAN	What on earth gave you that idea?
L239824	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Were you recently in the bathroom?
L239823	u1154	m75	WOMAN	Yes?
L240302	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But it's my favorite state.
L240301	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Life is just a state of mind.
L240300	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
L240299	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
L240298	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
L240289	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Full-stream with strogon pulse.
L240288	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What now?
L240184	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
L240183	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	You talked to Gozer?
L240182	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer.
L240181	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Who?
L240180	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"She said he was ""the Destructor."""
L240179	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
L240178	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
L240177	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
L240153	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, shit!
L240152	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Where's the Keymaster?
L240134	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
L240133	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	He wants to shut down the storage grid.
L240113	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right, Peter.  Good night.
L240112	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
L240111	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right.  I'll try.
L240110	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
L240109	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I agree.
L240108	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
L240107	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
L240106	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
L240105	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Does she want to be?
L240104	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
L240103	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240102	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
L239858	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
L239857	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"What do you mean ""bad?"""
L239856	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Trust me.  It will be bad.
L239855	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why not?
L239854	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Don't cross the beams.
L239853	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?
L239852	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
L239819	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, I can smell it.
L239818	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Something was definitely here.
L239780	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
L239779	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Did you see anything?
L239718	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
L239717	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
L239656	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
L239655	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
L239629	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Wow!
L239628	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm always serious.
L239627	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
L239589	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
L239588	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
L239587	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What have you got, Egon?
L239586	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh!  You're here.
L240272	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	That appears to be the case.
L240271	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
L240170	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
L240169	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
L240151	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
L240150	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What happened??!!!?
L240000	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
L239999	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239998	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I've got to sleep.
L239997	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Neutronize.  System shut.
L239996	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Set entry grid.
L239869	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
L239868	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's working!
L239832	u1150	m75	STANTZ	God, it's ugly!
L239831	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
L239817	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	We'd better adjust our streams.
L239816	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sorry, Buddy!
L239811	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I blame myself.
L239810	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
L239722	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
L239721	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
L240287	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
L240286	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
L240285	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
L240280	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look!
L240279	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?  What popped in there?
L240278	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
L240262	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
L240261	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Agile bastard, isn't he?
L240255	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, that ought to do it.
L240254	u1150	m75	STANTZ	As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
L240252	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't think it's Shandor.
L240251	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
L240176	u1150	m75	STANTZ	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
L240175	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who was the architect?
L240174	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
L240173	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
L240006	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's not good, Pete.
L240005	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239956	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
L239955	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy, that was a rough one.
L239845	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
L239844	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	How do you know?
L239843	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
L239842	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
L239841	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
L239840	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
L239839	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Third floor.  Get down here,
L239838	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Where are you, Pete?
L239837	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray -- Something's here.
L239822	u1150	m75	STANTZ	All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
L239821	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
L239820	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
L239814	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
L239813	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No sense worrying about it now.
L239812	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So do I.
L239782	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
L239781	u1150	m75	STANTZ	They will.
L239778	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
L239777	u1150	m75	STANTZ	How was your date?
L239730	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
L239729	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
L239697	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Fourteen hundred.
L239696	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
L239695	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
L239663	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."
L239662	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Wow!  Does this pole still work?
L239658	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
L239657	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But most people are afraid to even report these things.
L239654	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
L239653	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
L239652	u1150	m75	STANTZ	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
L239651	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You'll never regret this, Ray.
L239649	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	To go into business for ourselves.
L239648	u1150	m75	STANTZ	For what purpose?
L239647	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
L239646	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
L239645	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
L239644	u1150	m75	STANTZ	This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
L239642	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
L239641	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
L239633	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
L239632	u1150	m75	STANTZ	If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
L239631	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
L239624	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
L239623	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
L239622	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get her?  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
L239615	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
L239614	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
L239613	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Anything!  Just make contact.
L239612	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do I say?
L239611	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  Talk to it.
L239610	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do we do now?
L239609	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I told you it's real.
L239607	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
L239606	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What is it?
L239583	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
L239582	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
L239581	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Looked at with your eyes.
L239580	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean by ""seen?"""
L239579	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
L239578	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
L239574	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
L239573	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
L239572	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
L239571	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
L240268	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
L240267	u1153	m75	WINSTON	What's he talking about?  Choose what?
L240121	u1150	m75	STANTZ	LATER, MAN!!
L240120	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Stantz?  You okay in there?
L240088	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  We'll believe anything.
L240087	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
L240083	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
L240082	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
L240081	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, Judgement Day.
L240080	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Judgement Day ...
L240079	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
L240078	u1150	m75	STANTZ	And the seas would boil ...
L240077	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
L240076	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
L240075	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
L240074	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
L240073	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Do you believe in God?
L240072	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
L240071	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too.
L240070	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Mmmhmmm.
L240069	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Are you a Christian, Ray?
L240068	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
L240067	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
L239968	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
L239967	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
L296577	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
L296576	u1422	m95	EMMA	You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
L296575	u1422	m95	EMMA	I want to talk.  I just learned again.
L296574	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Shhh... don't talk.
L296573	u1422	m95	EMMA	He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
L296572	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Emma...
L296558	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296557	u1422	m95	EMMA	Do you still want me to stay?
L296556	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296555	u1422	m95	EMMA	You want me to stay?
L296550	u1422	m95	EMMA	Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
L296549	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	That's who you are too, Emma.
L296547	u1422	m95	EMMA	I don't know.
L296546	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Who?
L296545	u1422	m95	EMMA	Humans.
L296544	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	What's inside?
L296543	u1422	m95	EMMA	Yes.
L296542	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Have you looked inside?
L296541	u1422	m95	EMMA	I don't know.
L296540	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Have you always had it?
L296539	u1422	m95	EMMA	Mine.
L296535	u1422	m95	EMMA	I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
L296534	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	We don't know that --
L296533	u1422	m95	EMMA	Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
L296531	u1422	m95	EMMA	You know what I mean.
L296530	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	What do you mean?
L296529	u1422	m95	EMMA	What do you want?
L296528	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
L296527	u1422	m95	EMMA	You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
L296526	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	I only protect myself -- !
L296525	u1422	m95	EMMA	You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
L296524	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	What choice did I have -- ?!
L296522	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	You're not them.
L296521	u1422	m95	EMMA	Why don't you start with me?
L296520	u1422	m95	EMMA	You want to kill them.
L296519	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296518	u1422	m95	EMMA	You want to find them.
L296516	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Where you lived with them.
L296515	u1422	m95	EMMA	What?
L296514	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Do you remember where it is?
L296513	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296512	u1422	m95	EMMA	"Was this -- ""beautiful?""  Before?"
L296511	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	My wife.
L296510	u1422	m95	EMMA	Who is this?
L296509	u1422	m95	EMMA	Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
L296508	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
L296507	u1422	m95	EMMA	We move.  Place to place.
L296506	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296505	u1422	m95	EMMA	With them?
L296504	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	What about... now?
L296503	u1422	m95	EMMA	It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
L296502	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Do you remember where you lived?
L296501	u1422	m95	EMMA	It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
L296500	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	How much do you remember?
L296498	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Do you want to go on?
L296497	u1422	m95	EMMA	Yes.
L296496	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Are you all right?
L296492	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
L296491	u1422	m95	EMMA	It is not arguing to speak the truth.
L296489	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	My name is Robert.
L296488	u1422	m95	EMMA	That is not now, human!
L296487	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	You lived like this once.
L296486	u1422	m95	EMMA	I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
L296484	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	No.
L296483	u1422	m95	EMMA	You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
L296451	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Stay alive.
L296450	u1423	m95	FRENCH VOICE	That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
L296449	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
L296448	u1423	m95	FRENCH VOICE	Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
L296447	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
L296446	u1423	m95	FRENCH VOICE	That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
L296445	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
L296444	u1423	m95	FRENCH VOICE	Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
L296592	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	What?
L296591	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Virginia...?
L296590	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
L296588	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
L296587	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
L296586	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
L296585	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	I surrender --
L296584	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
L296583	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	You and that damned garden.
L296455	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
L296454	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Yes.
L296453	u1426	m95	VIRGINIA	I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
L296413	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	Round back.
L296412	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Bathroom?
L296411	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	I guess you could say that.
L296410	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	You built things.
L296409	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
L296408	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	So, what do you do?
L296407	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	You got that right.
L296406	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Hell of a night.
L296405	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	That's fine.
L296404	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	Only got one kind.
L296403	u1424	m95	NEVILLE	Please.
L296402	u1425	m95	OLD MAN	Need some gas?
L307676	u1427	m96	DAD	Better now, son?
L307675	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I was so scared.
L307674	u1427	m96	DAD	I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
L307670	u1427	m96	DAD	It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
L307669	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was so real, Dad.
L307668	u1427	m96	DAD	That's a doozy of a dream, son.
L307667	u1429	m96	JIMMY	... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
L307664	u1429	m96	JIMMY	First lemme look at your necks.
L307663	u1427	m96	DAD	What, Jim, what?
L307662	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I had an awful dream.
L307298	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Was there anything over the hill?
L307297	u1427	m96	DAD	I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
L307294	u1427	m96	DAD	Sure ... fine.
L307293	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Are you all right, Dad?
L307288	u1427	m96	DAD	I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
L307287	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
L307286	u1427	m96	DAD	Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
L307285	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
L307284	u1427	m96	DAD	What did it look like?
L307283	u1429	m96	JIMMY	It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
L307282	u1429	m96	JIMMY	You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
L307281	u1427	m96	DAD	Jim -- what's wrong?!
L307277	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Okay.
L307276	u1427	m96	DAD	Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
L307271	u1427	m96	DAD	That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
L307270	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
L307268	u1427	m96	DAD	And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
L307267	u1429	m96	JIMMY	... and Rigel.
L307266	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There's Cassius ...
L307265	u1427	m96	DAD	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
L307264	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There are more this year than last.
L307244	u1427	m96	DAD	Because the sky is so clear out here.
L307243	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Why, Dad?
L307242	u1427	m96	DAD	It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
L307241	u1429	m96	JIMMY	A meteorite, Dad, look!
L307236	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
L307235	u1427	m96	DAD	It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
L307234	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
L307233	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Let's check it out, Dad.
L307232	u1427	m96	DAD	If we want it, it is.
L307231	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Is the hill ours too?
L307230	u1427	m96	DAD	This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
L307229	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Wow.  Look at the mountains.
L307221	u1427	m96	DAD	That's the Air Force Base.
L307220	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What's that, Dad?
L307218	u1427	m96	DAD	You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
L307217	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
L307216	u1427	m96	DAD	I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
L307215	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Do we have to?
L307214	u1427	m96	DAD	We're going to be moving, son.
L307213	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.
L307212	u1427	m96	DAD	Son ... are you awake?
L307678	u1431	m96	MOM	Good night.
L307677	u1427	m96	DAD	Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
L307384	u1431	m96	MOM	It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
L307383	u1427	m96	DAD	What's wrong, Ellen?
L307377	u1431	m96	MOM	George, you're acting very strangely.
L307376	u1427	m96	DAD	You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
L307374	u1431	m96	MOM	Yes -- but ...
L307373	u1427	m96	DAD	I'm home now.
L307371	u1431	m96	MOM	You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
L307370	u1427	m96	DAD	I left it at work.
L307369	u1431	m96	MOM	Where's your car?
L307368	u1427	m96	DAD	That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
L307367	u1431	m96	MOM	What happened to you?  Who was that?
L307313	u1431	m96	MOM	I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
L307312	u1427	m96	DAD	It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
L307308	u1431	m96	MOM	You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
L307307	u1427	m96	DAD	I'll take you to school.
L307306	u1431	m96	MOM	I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
L307451	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why, yes.  Why?
L307450	u1427	m96	DAD	Is that all he said?
L307449	u1430	m96	LINDA	He was upset with moving, I believe.
L307448	u1427	m96	DAD	What did he talk to you about?
L307447	u1430	m96	LINDA	I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
L307446	u1427	m96	DAD	What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
L307437	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes, Mr. Gardner.
L307436	u1427	m96	DAD	We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
L307435	u1430	m96	LINDA	Of course.
L307434	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
L307433	u1430	m96	LINDA	Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
L307432	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
L307431	u1430	m96	LINDA	Mr. Gardner, I --
L307430	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
L307429	u1430	m96	LINDA	Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
L307428	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	About what?
L307427	u1430	m96	LINDA	We were having a little talk.
L307426	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	May I ask why?
L307425	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
L307424	u1428	m96	DAD'S VOICE	I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
L307423	u1430	m96	LINDA	Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
L307534	u1429	m96	JIMMY	They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
L307533	u1430	m96	LINDA	You're looking for life?
L307506	u1430	m96	LINDA	Let's try.
L307505	u1429	m96	JIMMY	There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
L307504	u1430	m96	LINDA	We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
L307503	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
L307502	u1430	m96	LINDA	Don't go in.
L307500	u1430	m96	LINDA	Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
L307499	u1429	m96	JIMMY	But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
L307498	u1430	m96	LINDA	I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
L307497	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What is it?
L307491	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I know a way.
L307490	u1430	m96	LINDA	Damn.
L307489	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Hide the car.
L307488	u1430	m96	LINDA	No one comes here after dark.
L307486	u1430	m96	LINDA	All their lines were busy.
L307485	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Did you call the State Police?
L307482	u1430	m96	LINDA	The State Police.
L307481	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Who are you calling?
L307480	u1430	m96	LINDA	Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
L307473	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
L307472	u1430	m96	LINDA	Does it look to you like anything landed here?
L307469	u1430	m96	LINDA	We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
L307468	u1429	m96	JIMMY	They'll get us.
L307467	u1430	m96	LINDA	Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
L307466	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No.
L307465	u1430	m96	LINDA	But it's not, Jimmy.
L307464	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I swear it was here.
L307462	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No, but it was here.
L307461	u1430	m96	LINDA	I don't see anything.
L307460	u1429	m96	JIMMY	This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
L307457	u1430	m96	LINDA	If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
L307456	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Behind my house, up on the ridge.
L307455	u1430	m96	LINDA	Where, Jimmy?
L307454	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
L307453	u1430	m96	LINDA	Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
L307442	u1430	m96	LINDA	This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
L307441	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.  I can even read star maps.
L307440	u1430	m96	LINDA	Do you know how to follow a map?
L307414	u1429	m96	JIMMY	'Cause he wouldn't lie.
L307413	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why?
L307412	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I'd believe him.
L307411	u1430	m96	LINDA	What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
L307410	u1429	m96	JIMMY	She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
L307409	u1430	m96	LINDA	How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
L307408	u1430	m96	LINDA	A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
L307407	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Yes.
L307406	u1430	m96	LINDA	That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
L307201	u1430	m96	LINDA	Can you tell me about that?
L307200	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
L307199	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
L307198	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No.
L307197	u1430	m96	LINDA	This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
L307673	u1431	m96	MOM	Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
L307672	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What kind, Mom?
L307671	u1431	m96	MOM	It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
L307396	u1431	m96	MOM	I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
L307395	u1429	m96	JIMMY	I have school.
L307394	u1431	m96	MOM	This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
L307393	u1429	m96	JIMMY	When?
L307380	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
L307379	u1431	m96	MOM	What?
L307378	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
L307344	u1429	m96	JIMMY	The back door was open.
L307343	u1431	m96	MOM	Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
L307304	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What? -- I... 
L307303	u1431	m96	MOM	Your father asked you a question.
L307296	u1429	m96	JIMMY	What happened to your other slipper?
L307295	u1431	m96	MOM	George, where have you been?
L307290	u1429	m96	JIMMY	No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
L307289	u1431	m96	MOM	What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
L307274	u1431	m96	MOM	I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
L307273	u1429	m96	JIMMY	Mom -- this is the best show all year.
L307272	u1431	m96	MOM	Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
L307422	u1430	m96	LINDA	All right.  I'll be right back.
L307421	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
L307420	u1430	m96	LINDA	Why, yes.
L307419	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
L307184	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
L307183	u1430	m96	LINDA	What's his family background?
L307182	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Oh?
L307181	u1430	m96	LINDA	His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
L307180	u1432	m96	PRINCIPAL	Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
L307179	u1430	m96	LINDA	What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
L299148	u1446	m97	PHILIP	If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
L299147	u1433	m97	ALICIA	This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
L298768	u1446	m97	PHILIP	Cool.
L298767	u1433	m97	ALICIA	We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
L298766	u1446	m97	PHILIP	I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
L298765	u1433	m97	ALICIA	It's really nice of you to help us.
L298764	u1446	m97	PHILIP	Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
L299185	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You bet it did.
L299184	u1435	m97	DAVID	Did it work?
L299183	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Are you all right?
L299063	u1435	m97	DAVID	If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
L299062	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
L299059	u1435	m97	DAVID	We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
L299058	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
L298937	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
L298936	u1435	m97	DAVID	Better be. You left me for him.
L298935	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	He's a good man.
L298934	u1435	m97	DAVID	You still believe in him.
L298932	u1435	m97	DAVID	A toast to the end of the world.
L298931	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I take it you've heard.
L298930	u1435	m97	DAVID	Just my luck, no ice.
L298781	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David, don't...
L298780	u1435	m97	DAVID	You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
L298647	u1435	m97	DAVID	He's not going to listen to me.
L298646	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
L298645	u1435	m97	DAVID	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
L298644	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What do you want me to do?
L298643	u1435	m97	DAVID	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
L298642	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
L298625	u1435	m97	DAVID	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
L298624	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David? How'd you get this number?
L298623	u1435	m97	DAVID	Connie, don't hang up.
L298622	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What?
L298522	u1435	m97	DAVID	It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
L298521	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You're being paranoid.
L298520	u1435	m97	DAVID	I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
L298519	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
L298518	u1435	m97	DAVID	You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
L298517	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
L298516	u1435	m97	DAVID	You have to leave the White House.
L298515	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What do you want?
L298723	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
L298722	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Love was never our problem.
L298721	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
L298720	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Spunky. He told you about that?
L298719	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Think nothing of it, Spanky.
L298718	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
L298665	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
L298664	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
L298653	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Punched the President? Oh my god.
L298652	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
L298739	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then get them out of there.
L298738	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	We're losing them.
L298703	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
L298702	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You saved a lot of lives.
L298662	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I'll bet.
L298661	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
L298660	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I don't know how you put up with him.
L298439	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	More than likely.
L298438	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
L298511	u1435	m97	DAVID	Checkmate.
L298510	u1440	m97	MARTY	Then what?
L298507	u1435	m97	DAVID	Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
L298506	u1440	m97	MARTY	A countdown to what?
L298505	u1435	m97	DAVID	That signal. It's a countdown.
L298504	u1440	m97	MARTY	Not really...
L298503	u1435	m97	DAVID	Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
L298502	u1440	m97	MARTY	Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
L298500	u1435	m97	DAVID	Just do it!
L298499	u1440	m97	MARTY	What happened?
L298498	u1435	m97	DAVID	Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
L298456	u1440	m97	MARTY	Haven't you been watching?
L298455	u1435	m97	DAVID	What're you talking about?
L298454	u1440	m97	MARTY	Can you believe this?
L298453	u1435	m97	DAVID	Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
L298452	u1440	m97	MARTY	Huh? Oh, good, good.
L298451	u1435	m97	DAVID	I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
L298404	u1440	m97	MARTY	...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
L298403	u1435	m97	DAVID	Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
L298402	u1440	m97	MARTY	That's the good news?
L298401	u1435	m97	DAVID	No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
L298400	u1440	m97	MARTY	And the good news is you won't charge me.
L298399	u1435	m97	DAVID	You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
L298398	u1440	m97	MARTY	What's the bad news?
L298397	u1435	m97	DAVID	There's good news and bad news.
L298354	u1440	m97	MARTY	We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
L298353	u1435	m97	DAVID	Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
L298352	u1440	m97	MARTY	Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
L298351	u1435	m97	DAVID	Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
L298350	u1440	m97	MARTY	So sue me.
L298349	u1435	m97	DAVID	What the hell is this?
L298347	u1440	m97	MARTY	Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
L298346	u1435	m97	DAVID	It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
L298345	u1440	m97	MARTY	What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
L299088	u1442	m97	MOISHE	I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
L299087	u1435	m97	DAVID	Thanks, Pops.
L298982	u1435	m97	DAVID	A cold? Of course.
L298981	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What'd I say?
L298980	u1435	m97	DAVID	Pops, you're a genius!
L298978	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, you're drunk.
L298977	u1435	m97	DAVID	We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
L298976	u1442	m97	MOISHE	This I can see.
L298975	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'm making a mess.
L298974	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
L298791	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
L298790	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad, please...
L298715	u1435	m97	DAVID	Moishe, please, don't talk.
L298714	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
L298651	u1435	m97	DAVID	He wasn't the President then.
L298650	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You punched the President in the face?
L298649	u1435	m97	DAVID	Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
L298648	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
L298619	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You can do that?
L298618	u1435	m97	DAVID	Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
L298617	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's perfect the line is busy?
L298616	u1435	m97	DAVID	Perfect, she's using it.
L298603	u1435	m97	DAVID	She didn't take my name when we were married.
L298602	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You try Martin?
L298601	u1435	m97	DAVID	College nickname.
L298600	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Spunky?
L298599	u1435	m97	DAVID	I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
L298598	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Not listed, huh?
L298582	u1435	m97	DAVID	She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
L298581	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
L298580	u1435	m97	DAVID	This, pops, is every phone book in America.
L298579	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What the hell is that?
L298555	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
L298554	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad...
L298553	u1442	m97	MOISHE	And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
L298552	u1435	m97	DAVID	They don't know this.
L298551	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
L298550	u1435	m97	DAVID	Can't this thing go any faster?
L298549	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
L298529	u1435	m97	DAVID	That's okay. You're driving.
L298528	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
L298527	u1435	m97	DAVID	You still got the Olds?
L298526	u1442	m97	MOISHE	The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
L298525	u1435	m97	DAVID	Pops!
L298340	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
L298339	u1435	m97	DAVID	Three years.
L298338	u1442	m97	MOISHE	I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
L298337	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad, don't start.
L298336	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
L298335	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
L298334	u1435	m97	DAVID	You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
L298332	u1442	m97	MOISHE	So think already.
L298331	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'm thinking.
L298330	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
L299177	u1450	m97	STEVE	I don't hear no fat lady.
L299176	u1435	m97	DAVID	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
L299175	u1450	m97	STEVE	We're loose!
L299171	u1435	m97	DAVID	You as well.
L299170	u1450	m97	STEVE	Nice meeting you.
L299142	u1435	m97	DAVID	It's not me. They're overriding the system.
L299141	u1450	m97	STEVE	What're you doing?
L299140	u1450	m97	STEVE	I can't shake her free.
L299139	u1435	m97	DAVID	Get us out of here!
L299118	u1450	m97	STEVE	Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
L299117	u1435	m97	DAVID	Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
L299100	u1450	m97	STEVE	Just getting a feel for her.
L299099	u1435	m97	DAVID	What the hell are you doing?
L299095	u1450	m97	STEVE	Great.
L299094	u1435	m97	DAVID	I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
L299057	u1435	m97	DAVID	We'll meet you there.
L299056	u1450	m97	STEVE	Oh shit, we're late.
L299055	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
L299113	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Roger.
L299112	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
L299104	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
L299103	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where's it headed?
L299102	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
L299101	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Grey, you read me?
L299084	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
L299083	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
L299041	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then find them.
L299040	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
L299039	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	But what, General?
L299038	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We've been collecting planes from all over but...
L299037	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And our troops here?
L299036	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
L299035	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Better than we thought.
L299034	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	How're we doing?
L299020	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Yes, Sir.
L299019	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
L298868	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	We're being exterminated.
L298867	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
L298866	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And our forces?
L298864	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
L298863	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
L298709	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	ETA with target; four minutes.
L298708	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where are they?
L298705	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
L298704	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Any news on my wife?
L298686	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	She should be shortly.
L298685	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Is my wife in the air?
L298675	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
L298674	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	But Mr. President...
L298673	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
L298449	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then God help us.
L298448	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
L298447	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I had a feeling you would.
L298446	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
L299009	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
L299008	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	With their shields down it might be possible.
L299005	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	How long would their shields be down?
L299004	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	This is ridiculous.
L298862	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
L298861	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	It had been deemed classified.
L298860	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
L298779	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
L298778	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
L298777	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	That's impossible...
L298563	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
L298562	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
L298561	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
L298437	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
L298436	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
L298383	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
L298382	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
L298303	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	It's... slowing down, Sir.
L298302	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	It's doing what?
L298301	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	Well, er... it's slowing down.
L298300	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	How do you know?
L298299	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	No Sir. Definitely not.
L298298	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	A meteor?
L299182	u1450	m97	STEVE	Butt-munch.
L299181	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dick-weed.
L299180	u1450	m97	STEVE	Yeah, but what an entrance!
L299179	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You scared the hell out of me.
L299075	u1450	m97	STEVE	I should have done this a long long time ago.
L299074	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Sorry for what?
L299073	u1450	m97	STEVE	Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
L299072	u1437	m97	JASMINE	I know, you like to make a big entrance.
L299071	u1450	m97	STEVE	You know me...
L299070	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You're late.
L298959	u1450	m97	STEVE	You know how I like to make a big entrance.
L298958	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You're late.
L298546	u1450	m97	STEVE	Butt-munch.
L298545	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dick-weed!
L298544	u1450	m97	STEVE	Yes, I am.
L298543	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
L298542	u1450	m97	STEVE	Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
L298541	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Really? You don't mind?
L298540	u1450	m97	STEVE	Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
L298539	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Be careful.
L298538	u1450	m97	STEVE	What?
L298537	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Wait. I have to tell you something.
L298533	u1450	m97	STEVE	They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
L298532	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
L298531	u1450	m97	STEVE	Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
L298530	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You can't go. Call them back.
L298487	u1450	m97	STEVE	He's doing a good job.
L298486	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He's trying to impress you.
L298894	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
L298893	u1439	m97	MARGARET	I thought you didn't recognize me.
L298892	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
L298891	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
L298890	u1439	m97	MARGARET	And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
L298889	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
L298888	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Oh. Sorry.
L298887	u1437	m97	JASMINE	No. Exotic.
L298886	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Really? Ballet?
L298885	u1437	m97	JASMINE	I'm a dancer.
L298884	u1439	m97	MARGARET	So, what do you do for a living?
L298883	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
L298882	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Was his father stationed here?
L298881	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He's my angel.
L298880	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Your son.
L298746	u1450	m97	STEVE	Jimmy, stay with me.
L298745	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Stevie... I can't...
L298744	u1450	m97	STEVE	So push it!
L298743	u1438	m97	JIMMY	We're already over Mach 2!
L298742	u1450	m97	STEVE	Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
L298732	u1450	m97	STEVE	"Command, Eagle One. Switching to ""sidewinders."" We're moving in."
L298731	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I didn't even see them fire!
L298730	u1450	m97	STEVE	Damn it!
L298725	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
L298724	u1450	m97	STEVE	I shouldn't have left her.
L298713	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I hear you.
L298712	u1450	m97	STEVE	Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
L298711	u1438	m97	JIMMY	That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
L298613	u1450	m97	STEVE	I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
L298612	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
L298611	u1450	m97	STEVE	How to kiss ass.
L298610	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
L298696	u1451	m97	TROY	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
L298695	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	But I gave you some this morning.
L298571	u1451	m97	TROY	That'd be cool!
L298570	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
L298569	u1451	m97	TROY	He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
L298360	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
L298359	u1451	m97	TROY	I don't need it.
L298358	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
L298357	u1451	m97	TROY	It's all fuzzy.
L298356	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Stop it.
L299043	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
L299042	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	How' he doing?
L298763	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
L298762	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	We should leave too.
L298761	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
L298634	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
L298633	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
L298631	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
L298630	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
L298629	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
L298628	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	They let you out?
L298410	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
L298409	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	You sure?
L298408	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
L298407	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
L298406	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
L298957	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I said call them back.
L298956	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
L298955	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Call them back.
L298948	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Deploy.
L298947	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Mr. President?
L298815	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
L298814	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
L298774	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
L298773	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Above American soil?
L298772	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
L298677	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	We're leaving.
L298676	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	What the hell's going on?
L298445	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
L298444	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	But, Mr. President...
L298443	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
L298442	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
L298441	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I'm not leaving.
L298835	u1444	m97	OKUN	These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
L298834	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can they be killed?
L298829	u1444	m97	OKUN	Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
L298828	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
L298827	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	"People are dying out there. I don't think ""exciting"" is the word I'd choose to describe it!"
L298826	u1444	m97	OKUN	See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
L298821	u1444	m97	OKUN	Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
L298820	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Yes.
L298819	u1444	m97	OKUN	Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
L298921	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Die.
L298920	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	What do you want us to do?
L298919	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Peace? No peace.
L298918	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
L298917	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Many worlds...
L298916	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And before here?
L298915	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Here... now.
L298914	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
L298913	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	"Air... water... your ""sun."""
L298912	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Why did you people come here?
L303627	u1469	m100	AL	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
L303626	u1475	m100	JOE	What are you doing?
L303551	u1475	m100	JOE	That's nice.
L303550	u1469	m100	AL	In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
L303543	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
L303542	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll get us out of here.
L303541	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
L303537	u1469	m100	AL	I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
L303536	u1475	m100	JOE	Awwww...
L303533	u1475	m100	JOE	I want to thank you for what you've done.
L303532	u1469	m100	AL	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
L303531	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
L303528	u1475	m100	JOE	You're lovely.
L303527	u1469	m100	AL	She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
L303523	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah, sure.
L303522	u1469	m100	AL	You're a lucky man.
L303515	u1475	m100	JOE	They can?
L303514	u1469	m100	AL	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
L303513	u1469	m100	AL	I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
L303508	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh no!
L303507	u1469	m100	AL	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
L303506	u1469	m100	AL	Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
L303503	u1475	m100	JOE	You've changed your mind.
L303502	u1469	m100	AL	She is beautiful.
L303491	u1475	m100	JOE	No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
L303490	u1469	m100	AL	I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
L303489	u1475	m100	JOE	You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
L303488	u1469	m100	AL	Now, you're too suspicious.
L303487	u1475	m100	JOE	She works for them.
L303486	u1469	m100	AL	Rene?
L303485	u1475	m100	JOE	Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
L303484	u1469	m100	AL	About what?
L303483	u1475	m100	JOE	I have been... I think you're right.
L303482	u1469	m100	AL	Keep thinking.
L303481	u1475	m100	JOE	I can always flush you down the toilet.
L303480	u1475	m100	JOE	Looks like you can have all you want.
L303479	u1469	m100	AL	Gimme a minute.
L303478	u1475	m100	JOE	We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
L303477	u1469	m100	AL	Never mind that, where are we now.
L303476	u1475	m100	JOE	Where've you been?
L303475	u1469	m100	AL	Be quiet.
L303466	u1469	m100	AL	Losing power. The laser drained it.
L303465	u1475	m100	JOE	What happened?
L303456	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know.
L303455	u1469	m100	AL	What exactly?
L303454	u1475	m100	JOE	Do something.
L303450	u1469	m100	AL	Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
L303449	u1475	m100	JOE	Pretty advanced, isn't it?
L303432	u1475	m100	JOE	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
L303431	u1469	m100	AL	This may hurt.
L303430	u1469	m100	AL	And don't let her know, either.
L303429	u1475	m100	JOE	There's a lot you don't know.
L303415	u1469	m100	AL	GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
L303414	u1475	m100	JOE	Dieter!
L303413	u1469	m100	AL	The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
L303412	u1475	m100	JOE	He aready made the deal..
L303410	u1469	m100	AL	...Shit! It's just money.
L303409	u1475	m100	JOE	Holy...
L303401	u1475	m100	JOE	Aim what?
L303400	u1469	m100	AL	Aim just in front of his face.
L303396	u1475	m100	JOE	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
L303395	u1469	m100	AL	Are you alright?
L303386	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry, I can.
L303385	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't handle that thing.
L303384	u1469	m100	AL	Do it.
L303382	u1469	m100	AL	He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
L303381	u1475	m100	JOE	Then, why'd he lead us here.
L303380	u1469	m100	AL	He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
L303379	u1475	m100	JOE	And Dieter?
L303378	u1469	m100	AL	It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
L303349	u1475	m100	JOE	Where?
L303348	u1469	m100	AL	While he makes the run.
L303347	u1475	m100	JOE	He hung us up dry.
L303341	u1469	m100	AL	It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
L303340	u1475	m100	JOE	Well...?
L303339	u1469	m100	AL	Left...The one with the red dot.
L303332	u1469	m100	AL	Cash.
L303331	u1475	m100	JOE	haka xuki. What's that mean?
L303330	u1469	m100	AL	haka xuki.
L303329	u1469	m100	AL	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
L303328	u1475	m100	JOE	What was it? What'd I say?
L303326	u1469	m100	AL	Just say the words. Just like I told you.
L303325	u1475	m100	JOE	Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
L303324	u1469	m100	AL	Not sure at all.
L303323	u1475	m100	JOE	You sure this will work?
L303320	u1475	m100	JOE	I was afraid of that.
L303319	u1469	m100	AL	I've got an idea.
L303318	u1469	m100	AL	Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
L303311	u1475	m100	JOE	Come on.
L303310	u1469	m100	AL	It's him.
L303295	u1475	m100	JOE	Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
L303294	u1469	m100	AL	I don't trust her.
L303293	u1475	m100	JOE	Probably.
L303292	u1469	m100	AL	Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
L303275	u1469	m100	AL	No. You can't trust her.
L303274	u1475	m100	JOE	I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
L303249	u1475	m100	JOE	You were with GRUNER!
L303248	u1469	m100	AL	He was with Gruner!
L303242	u1469	m100	AL	Never mind, just say it.
L303241	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L303225	u1469	m100	AL	Neither can they.
L303224	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't see a thing.
L303223	u1469	m100	AL	Door to the right. Get up and run.
L303222	u1469	m100	AL	A hard left. A hard left.
L303221	u1475	m100	JOE	Ow!
L303213	u1469	m100	AL	Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
L303212	u1475	m100	JOE	What are you doing?
L303210	u1475	m100	JOE	...imagine a better grape for the region.
L303209	u1469	m100	AL	You have to! Quickly!
L303208	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't...
L303205	u1469	m100	AL	Drink lots of water.
L303204	u1475	m100	JOE	What next!
L303199	u1475	m100	JOE	Too late.
L303198	u1469	m100	AL	...drink it.
L303190	u1475	m100	JOE	Don't worry!
L303189	u1469	m100	AL	Don't touch a thing.
L303184	u1475	m100	JOE	I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
L303183	u1469	m100	AL	One of your instincts?
L303182	u1475	m100	JOE	I told you, I have a feeling...
L303181	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah...You've fallen for her.
L303148	u1475	m100	JOE	You think. That's what you're good at.
L303147	u1469	m100	AL	What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
L303146	u1475	m100	JOE	It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
L303145	u1469	m100	AL	Relax. Make your mind a blank.
L303144	u1469	m100	AL	Relax. Let me do this.
L303143	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L303142	u1469	m100	AL	`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
L303135	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
L303134	u1469	m100	AL	Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
L303133	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you going?
L303132	u1469	m100	AL	Just stay here and rest.
L303131	u1475	m100	JOE	Sapporo..
L303130	u1469	m100	AL	That's not funny.
L303129	u1475	m100	JOE	Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
L303126	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't keep up.
L303125	u1469	m100	AL	Come on, she's getting away.
L303124	u1469	m100	AL	Run, stupid!
L303123	u1475	m100	JOE	On what?
L303122	u1469	m100	AL	Follow her.
L303121	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L303120	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
L303119	u1469	m100	AL	We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
L303118	u1475	m100	JOE	Don't you think I stand out like this.
L303117	u1469	m100	AL	Fountainhead of High-Tech.
L303116	u1475	m100	JOE	Osaka?
L303115	u1469	m100	AL	Osaka.
L303114	u1475	m100	JOE	That's good. It's not better. Where?
L303113	u1469	m100	AL	Better. I found Ryuji.
L303112	u1475	m100	JOE	You found her.
L303111	u1469	m100	AL	Bingo.
L303110	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you get out of my face.
L303109	u1469	m100	AL	Some agent you are.
L303108	u1475	m100	JOE	It wasn't like that.
L303107	u1469	m100	AL	You been had. We have.
L303103	u1469	m100	AL	I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
L303102	u1475	m100	JOE	No. What will you do.
L303101	u1475	m100	JOE	No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
L303096	u1469	m100	AL	You get time off to sleep.
L303095	u1475	m100	JOE	It's not your time. I get time off.
L303094	u1469	m100	AL	And on my time.
L303093	u1469	m100	AL	Shit! You're in love.
L303092	u1475	m100	JOE	She's got the most beautiful...s
L303090	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
L303089	u1469	m100	AL	Is that all?
L303088	u1475	m100	JOE	Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
L303087	u1469	m100	AL	What she say. What'd you get out of her?
L303086	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know!
L303085	u1469	m100	AL	What Happened?
L303055	u1475	m100	JOE	I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
L303054	u1469	m100	AL	Joe! It's 56 hours!
L303053	u1475	m100	JOE	You shut down your sensors.
L303052	u1469	m100	AL	Oh come on.
L303051	u1475	m100	JOE	You got any books in there?
L303050	u1469	m100	AL	What am I supposed to do?
L303049	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
L303048	u1469	m100	AL	What if she says something important?
L303047	u1475	m100	JOE	It's embarrassing.
L303046	u1475	m100	JOE	You can't listen. You can't watch either.
L303045	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L303044	u1475	m100	JOE	Not her. You!
L303043	u1469	m100	AL	You're doing great with her.
L303042	u1475	m100	JOE	This just won't work.
L303041	u1469	m100	AL	What is it, your charm?
L303023	u1475	m100	JOE	Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
L303022	u1469	m100	AL	Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
L303021	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe she's telling the truth.
L303020	u1469	m100	AL	She's the toughest to read.
L303019	u1475	m100	JOE	Even Rene?
L303018	u1475	m100	JOE	Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
L303017	u1469	m100	AL	Voice stress analyzer.
L303016	u1475	m100	JOE	How do you know?
L303015	u1469	m100	AL	They're all in it.
L303009	u1475	m100	JOE	...I've lost something. I must get it back.
L303008	u1469	m100	AL	Joe, be careful!
L302982	u1469	m100	AL	Don't get too cute.
L302981	u1475	m100	JOE	My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
L302980	u1469	m100	AL	He recognises you, throw him off.
L302969	u1469	m100	AL	It lends you an air of mystery.
L302968	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know what's going on.
L302967	u1469	m100	AL	Just don't show fear.
L302962	u1475	m100	JOE	Killer!
L302961	u1469	m100	AL	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
L302960	u1475	m100	JOE	Which one?
L302956	u1469	m100	AL	Just hold them close and stay still.
L302955	u1475	m100	JOE	I feel like an idiot.
L302950	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you serious?
L302949	u1469	m100	AL	Follow that busboy.
L302948	u1469	m100	AL	The drinks...Stay on them.
L302947	u1475	m100	JOE	What glasses.
L302946	u1469	m100	AL	Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
L302943	u1475	m100	JOE	That's a big if.
L302942	u1469	m100	AL	Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
L302941	u1475	m100	JOE	You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
L302940	u1475	m100	JOE	Who, me?
L302939	u1469	m100	AL	You're not just after this girl, are you?
L302921	u1475	m100	JOE	That place. By the window.
L302920	u1469	m100	AL	Get close to them.
L302916	u1475	m100	JOE	You have no taste.
L302915	u1469	m100	AL	They both look good to me.
L302914	u1475	m100	JOE	The beautiful one.
L302913	u1469	m100	AL	Which one is she?
L302912	u1469	m100	AL	Doesn't.
L302911	u1475	m100	JOE	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
L302910	u1469	m100	AL	What did that cost?
L302904	u1475	m100	JOE	Why not?!
L302903	u1469	m100	AL	Not that tie with that coat.
L302900	u1475	m100	JOE	But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
L302899	u1469	m100	AL	It is my business. It's my name.
L302898	u1475	m100	JOE	Mind your own business.
L302896	u1475	m100	JOE	Not blue enough.
L302895	u1469	m100	AL	Much too blue.
L302891	u1475	m100	JOE	This...is not going to work out.
L302890	u1469	m100	AL	You really like that shirt?
L302889	u1469	m100	AL	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
L302888	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L302885	u1469	m100	AL	Is something glinting?
L302884	u1475	m100	JOE	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
L302883	u1469	m100	AL	But what's it look like?
L302881	u1469	m100	AL	What are you looking at?
L302880	u1475	m100	JOE	Now, where would I be?
L302876	u1469	m100	AL	But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
L302875	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. I did it.
L302874	u1469	m100	AL	Well you did it today.
L302873	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
L302872	u1475	m100	JOE	Rene...
L302871	u1469	m100	AL	You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
L302870	u1475	m100	JOE	I made it work.
L302869	u1469	m100	AL	It worked.
L302868	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
L302867	u1469	m100	AL	Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
L302866	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
L302865	u1469	m100	AL	Without your pants.
L302864	u1475	m100	JOE	To the hotel. To register.
L302863	u1469	m100	AL	Where are you going?
L302862	u1475	m100	JOE	...Rene...
L302861	u1469	m100	AL	What happened?
L302851	u1469	m100	AL	No...you idiot!
L302850	u1475	m100	JOE	...Joe.
L302836	u1469	m100	AL	Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
L302835	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L302834	u1469	m100	AL	Touch her.
L302828	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you staying?
L302827	u1469	m100	AL	Where is she staying?
L302826	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait.
L302825	u1469	m100	AL	Wait.
L302813	u1475	m100	JOE	.
L302812	u1469	m100	AL	.
L302797	u1469	m100	AL	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
L302796	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L302795	u1469	m100	AL	Don't just stand there, say something.
L302794	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L302791	u1469	m100	AL	What can I do? You're on your own.
L302790	u1475	m100	JOE	Help me out, will you?
L302787	u1469	m100	AL	How should I know?
L302786	u1475	m100	JOE	Which language?
L302785	u1469	m100	AL	Try another language.
L302784	u1475	m100	JOE	She doesn't seem to understand.
L302783	u1469	m100	AL	What's happening?
L302782	u1475	m100	JOE	You're beautiful..
L302780	u1475	m100	JOE	She's beautiful...! What do I do?
L302779	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L302778	u1469	m100	AL	You're out of shape.
L302777	u1475	m100	JOE	She's...pretty fast.
L302774	u1469	m100	AL	Follow it.
L302773	u1475	m100	JOE	This must be business, there's nothing else here.
L302772	u1475	m100	JOE	A girl.
L302771	u1469	m100	AL	What was?
L302770	u1475	m100	JOE	Beautiful!
L302768	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you screwing with any nerves?
L302767	u1469	m100	AL	What? What do you mean?
L302766	u1475	m100	JOE	Al, are you doing anything in there?
L302763	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you going? Wait!
L302762	u1469	m100	AL	Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
L302761	u1469	m100	AL	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
L302760	u1475	m100	JOE	It's sand.
L302759	u1469	m100	AL	Why not?
L302758	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't want to eat it.
L302757	u1469	m100	AL	Eat it.
L302756	u1475	m100	JOE	Eat it?
L302755	u1469	m100	AL	The sand.
L302754	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L302753	u1469	m100	AL	I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
L302752	u1475	m100	JOE	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
L302751	u1469	m100	AL	You eat it.
L302750	u1475	m100	JOE	Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
L302749	u1475	m100	JOE	Little late for that.
L302748	u1469	m100	AL	Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
L302747	u1475	m100	JOE	Good Idea!
L302746	u1469	m100	AL	Swim.
L302745	u1475	m100	JOE	The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
L302744	u1469	m100	AL	Do you notice anything.
L302743	u1475	m100	JOE	...Just beautiful.
L302742	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L302741	u1475	m100	JOE	Holy shit!
L302740	u1469	m100	AL	Just get there.
L302739	u1475	m100	JOE	Eating sushi?
L302738	u1469	m100	AL	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
L302737	u1475	m100	JOE	The beach?
L302736	u1469	m100	AL	The beach.
L302735	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L302732	u1475	m100	JOE	You leave my glands alone!
L302731	u1469	m100	AL	Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
L302730	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
L302729	u1469	m100	AL	You'll be me.
L302728	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh yeah, to what?
L302727	u1469	m100	AL	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
L302726	u1475	m100	JOE	What's wrong with how I carry myself.
L302725	u1469	m100	AL	It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
L302724	u1475	m100	JOE	It's just not enough.
L302723	u1469	m100	AL	We'll change your appearance.
L302722	u1475	m100	JOE	They'll know who I am.
L302720	u1469	m100	AL	Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
L302719	u1475	m100	JOE	...and a license to kill...
L302717	u1469	m100	AL	You are in trouble. Now do it.
L302716	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll get in trouble.
L302715	u1469	m100	AL	Who cares?
L302714	u1475	m100	JOE	It's illegal.
L302713	u1469	m100	AL	Why not?
L302712	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't do that.
L302711	u1469	m100	AL	Use my credit cards.
L302710	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't have any.
L302709	u1469	m100	AL	What about it?
L302708	u1475	m100	JOE	What about money?
L302706	u1475	m100	JOE	We get on which plane?
L302705	u1469	m100	AL	We get on a plane.
L302704	u1475	m100	JOE	You mean...just leave.
L302701	u1469	m100	AL	You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
L302700	u1475	m100	JOE	Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
L302699	u1469	m100	AL	Send a man there. A secret agent.
L302698	u1475	m100	JOE	What do we do?
L302693	u1469	m100	AL	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
L302692	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L302689	u1469	m100	AL	Nothing. You just do nothing.
L302688	u1475	m100	JOE	What am I supposed to do?
L302687	u1469	m100	AL	Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
L302685	u1469	m100	AL	Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
L302684	u1475	m100	JOE	Who is it?
L302682	u1469	m100	AL	Good. Get to a phone.
L302681	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm at the airport.
L302680	u1469	m100	AL	I'm back.
L302678	u1475	m100	JOE	The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
L302677	u1469	m100	AL	I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
L302676	u1475	m100	JOE	Just scratched my arm, why?
L302675	u1469	m100	AL	Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
L302674	u1475	m100	JOE	Nothing!
L302673	u1469	m100	AL	Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
L302671	u1469	m100	AL	You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
L302670	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
L302669	u1469	m100	AL	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
L302668	u1475	m100	JOE	You need ID in there?
L302667	u1469	m100	AL	Don't know.
L302666	u1475	m100	JOE	Gone where?
L302665	u1469	m100	AL	They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
L302664	u1475	m100	JOE	That's not a good idea.
L302663	u1469	m100	AL	That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
L302662	u1475	m100	JOE	Black suits and helmets.
L302661	u1469	m100	AL	What do you mean?
L302660	u1475	m100	JOE	Like the guys that attacked us.
L302658	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't remember..
L302657	u1469	m100	AL	Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
L302655	u1475	m100	JOE	The man.
L302654	u1469	m100	AL	Who did?
L302653	u1475	m100	JOE	I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
L302652	u1469	m100	AL	Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
L302651	u1475	m100	JOE	A lab and equipment.
L302647	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are we going?
L302646	u1469	m100	AL	Take a left and your next right.
L302645	u1475	m100	JOE	Corridor A.
L302644	u1469	m100	AL	What does it say.
L302643	u1475	m100	JOE	Which way do I go?
L302642	u1469	m100	AL	With Authority!
L302641	u1475	m100	JOE	Just walk down the hall?
L302640	u1469	m100	AL	Go out, take your first left.
L302639	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what.
L302638	u1469	m100	AL	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
L302637	u1475	m100	JOE	Door's locked.
L302636	u1469	m100	AL	We have to get out of here.
L302635	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't like the sound of that.
L302630	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll sue.
L302629	u1469	m100	AL	Sue them.
L302611	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
L302610	u1469	m100	AL	They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
L302609	u1469	m100	AL	I'm not gonna make it easy.
L302608	u1475	m100	JOE	Find You?
L302607	u1469	m100	AL	Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
L302602	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm not leaving until you do.
L302601	u1469	m100	AL	Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
L302600	u1475	m100	JOE	Thanks.
L302599	u1469	m100	AL	We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
L302598	u1475	m100	JOE	I did. I brought you back here.
L302597	u1469	m100	AL	You gotta help.
L302596	u1475	m100	JOE	What do you mean we.
L302595	u1469	m100	AL	You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
L302594	u1475	m100	JOE	You are CRAZY!
L302593	u1469	m100	AL	I am. You are.
L302592	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah...Who is?
L302591	u1469	m100	AL	"They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."""

L303662	u1479	m100	RENE	He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
L303661	u1479	m100	RENE	He wants to apologise.
L303657	u1475	m100	JOE	We're not moving fast enough for him.
L303656	u1479	m100	RENE	What is it?
L303654	u1479	m100	RENE	I told you, I work for him.
L303653	u1475	m100	JOE	Riuji?
L303643	u1475	m100	JOE	"Like Al says...""Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats."
L303642	u1479	m100	RENE	That's twenty feet high.
L303641	u1475	m100	JOE	Come on.
L303639	u1479	m100	RENE	If he was able, what would he say.
L303638	u1475	m100	JOE	It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
L303636	u1479	m100	RENE	But you did it. It was you.
L303635	u1475	m100	JOE	He told me what to do.
L303634	u1479	m100	RENE	It was you.
L303633	u1475	m100	JOE	It wasn't me. It was him.
L303632	u1479	m100	RENE	You are, I've seen you.
L303631	u1475	m100	JOE	Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
L303630	u1479	m100	RENE	Do something!
L303629	u1475	m100	JOE	He can't help us.
L303619	u1475	m100	JOE	We just don't stop.
L303618	u1479	m100	RENE	Now what?
L303617	u1475	m100	JOE	I knew it. I told him.
L303616	u1479	m100	RENE	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
L303615	u1475	m100	JOE	Who are you? Who do you work for?
L303613	u1475	m100	JOE	Her?
L303612	u1479	m100	RENE	Kiss her you fool.
L303570	u1479	m100	RENE	You're gonna laugh.
L303569	u1475	m100	JOE	You son of a bitch! You conned me!
L303563	u1479	m100	RENE	Aren't you a little optimistic?
L303562	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll come back for you.
L303561	u1479	m100	RENE	Just like that?
L303560	u1475	m100	JOE	Escape.
L303559	u1479	m100	RENE	Why not, what are you going to do?
L303558	u1475	m100	JOE	Don't worry.
L303555	u1479	m100	RENE	I love you too.

L303548	u1479	m100	RENE	I've never met anyone like you.
L303547	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L303545	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L303544	u1479	m100	RENE	How?
L303539	u1475	m100	JOE	I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
L303538	u1479	m100	RENE	I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
L303526	u1479	m100	RENE	For you.
L303525	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did you, then?
L303524	u1479	m100	RENE	Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
L303521	u1479	m100	RENE	It was my choice.
L303520	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm sorry I got you into this.
L303518	u1479	m100	RENE	Can't you do something?
L303517	u1475	m100	JOE	They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
L303516	u1479	m100	RENE	What?
L303512	u1475	m100	JOE	Nothing we can do.
L303511	u1479	m100	RENE	You can say that again. What do we do?
L303510	u1475	m100	JOE	What a mess.
L303505	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303504	u1479	m100	RENE	What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
L303501	u1479	m100	RENE	They'll listen to what we say in here.
L303500	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L303499	u1479	m100	RENE	That I really don't know.
L303498	u1475	m100	JOE	What did you tell them?
L303497	u1479	m100	RENE	They asked about you.
L303496	u1475	m100	JOE	Looks like they can. What did they do?
L303495	u1479	m100	RENE	Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
L303494	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you alright?
L303469	u1479	m100	RENE	What'd...you forget?
L303468	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't fly it.
L303467	u1479	m100	RENE	What happened?
L303462	u1475	m100	JOE	Sure I can, can't I?
L303461	u1479	m100	RENE	Can you?
L303460	u1475	m100	JOE	Why not?
L303427	u1479	m100	RENE	He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
L303426	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
L303425	u1479	m100	RENE	This going to work?
L303424	u1475	m100	JOE	So do I.
L303421	u1475	m100	JOE	You coming along?
L303420	u1479	m100	RENE	I know the territory.
L303419	u1475	m100	JOE	You've  been there?
L303418	u1479	m100	RENE	That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
L303417	u1475	m100	JOE	...across THE BORDER. Come on!
L303416	u1479	m100	RENE	Chiang Cho?
L303390	u1475	m100	JOE	I said just relax. I'm in full control.
L303389	u1479	m100	RENE	What?
L303364	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
L303363	u1479	m100	RENE	He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
L303362	u1475	m100	JOE	Why'd you ask him.
L303360	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh.
L303359	u1479	m100	RENE	I asked him.
L303358	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
L303357	u1479	m100	RENE	Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
L303356	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L303355	u1479	m100	RENE	Hong Kong.
L303354	u1475	m100	JOE	If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
L303351	u1475	m100	JOE	Where would you go to sell a chip?
L303350	u1479	m100	RENE	Where what?
L303346	u1479	m100	RENE	Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
L303345	u1475	m100	JOE	Get us one.
L303344	u1479	m100	RENE	That must be him. Water taxi.
L303337	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
L303336	u1479	m100	RENE	How?
L303335	u1475	m100	JOE	We figure out if it's in here.
L303334	u1479	m100	RENE	Now what?
L303322	u1475	m100	JOE	He plays it all the time.
L303321	u1479	m100	RENE	What?
L303316	u1479	m100	RENE	Then where's the chip.
L303315	u1475	m100	JOE	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
L303314	u1479	m100	RENE	This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
L303313	u1475	m100	JOE	Beats me.
L303312	u1479	m100	RENE	Where we going?
L303308	u1479	m100	RENE	It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
L303307	u1475	m100	JOE	And you?
L303306	u1479	m100	RENE	Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
L303305	u1475	m100	JOE	And Dieter.
L303304	u1479	m100	RENE	Ryuji and Gruner.
L303303	u1475	m100	JOE	Who was?
L303302	u1479	m100	RENE	They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
L303301	u1475	m100	JOE	What's Gruner like?
L303300	u1475	m100	JOE	You think I'm like that?
L303299	u1479	m100	RENE	Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
L303298	u1475	m100	JOE	Then why are you smiling like that?
L303297	u1479	m100	RENE	Oh sure.
L303296	u1475	m100	JOE	You don't believe me.
L303291	u1475	m100	JOE	Get your things.
L303290	u1479	m100	RENE	Hiroshima.
L303289	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L303288	u1479	m100	RENE	I don't know. He mentioned a city.
L303286	u1475	m100	JOE	Got to trust someone.
L303285	u1479	m100	RENE	How do you know you can trust me?
L303284	u1475	m100	JOE	The most important one. Can you help me find him?
L303283	u1479	m100	RENE	One chip?
L303282	u1475	m100	JOE	A chip. Goes in a computer.
L303281	u1479	m100	RENE	What'd he steal?
L303280	u1475	m100	JOE	We're very close.
L303279	u1479	m100	RENE	He must be a good friend.
L303278	u1475	m100	JOE	He stole something. From a friend of mine.
L303277	u1479	m100	RENE	What's he done?
L303276	u1475	m100	JOE	You know where he went?
L303270	u1479	m100	RENE	Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
L303269	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm just on vacation.
L303268	u1479	m100	RENE	Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
L303267	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm sorry. What will you do?
L303266	u1479	m100	RENE	This business is over.
L303265	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303264	u1479	m100	RENE	I'm leaving too.
L303263	u1475	m100	JOE	Food doesn't agree with me.
L303262	u1479	m100	RENE	You're leaving.
L303192	u1475	m100	JOE	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
L303191	u1479	m100	RENE	I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
L303179	u1479	m100	RENE	You did.
L303178	u1475	m100	JOE	Who did?
L303177	u1479	m100	RENE	No.
L303176	u1475	m100	JOE	He didn't.
L303175	u1479	m100	RENE	No, he didn't do that.
L303174	u1475	m100	JOE	Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
L303173	u1479	m100	RENE	Last night?
L303172	u1475	m100	JOE	Were you working for him last night?
L303171	u1479	m100	RENE	Sometimes. I told you I did.
L303170	u1475	m100	JOE	You work for Ryuji?
L303169	u1479	m100	RENE	I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
L303168	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did they leave?
L303167	u1479	m100	RENE	There's not much to tell.
L303166	u1475	m100	JOE	What did you tell them?
L303165	u1479	m100	RENE	They kidded me a little.
L303164	u1475	m100	JOE	Your friends, did they ask about me?
L303163	u1479	m100	RENE	What do you mean?
L303162	u1475	m100	JOE	Who else is interested in me?
L303161	u1479	m100	RENE	You seemed interesting.
L303160	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303159	u1479	m100	RENE	Wanted to get to know you.
L303158	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did you stay with me?
L303157	u1475	m100	JOE	Why didn't you tell me?
L303156	u1479	m100	RENE	They left. I had to go with them.
L303155	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did you leave?
L303150	u1475	m100	JOE	Why'd you run off?
L303149	u1479	m100	RENE	Joe! What happened to you?
L303083	u1479	m100	RENE	That depends...
L303082	u1475	m100	JOE	And you, what do you like?
L303081	u1479	m100	RENE	He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
L303080	u1475	m100	JOE	How often they come here?
L303079	u1479	m100	RENE	To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
L303078	u1475	m100	JOE	Hires you for what?
L303077	u1479	m100	RENE	No. Ryuji just hires us.
L303076	u1475	m100	JOE	Is that Ryuji?
L303075	u1479	m100	RENE	Trans Ocean Travel.
L303074	u1475	m100	JOE	No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
L303073	u1479	m100	RENE	Who do you work for?
L303072	u1475	m100	JOE	...Naw. Made that up.
L303071	u1479	m100	RENE	...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
L303070	u1475	m100	JOE	Just Okay...
L303069	u1479	m100	RENE	You're doing...Okay.
L303068	u1475	m100	JOE	And how'm I doing?
L303067	u1479	m100	RENE	You're talking to me.
L303066	u1475	m100	JOE	That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
L303065	u1479	m100	RENE	You did.
L303064	u1475	m100	JOE	If I was with you, I wouldn't
L303063	u1479	m100	RENE	Why do you do it?
L303062	u1475	m100	JOE	But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
L303061	u1479	m100	RENE	You talk to yourself.
L303060	u1475	m100	JOE	I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
L303059	u1479	m100	RENE	That you're not crazy.
L303058	u1475	m100	JOE	Promise you what?
L303039	u1479	m100	RENE	Are you alright?
L303038	u1475	m100	JOE	You are.
L303037	u1479	m100	RENE	Can I help?
L303036	u1475	m100	JOE	I am sort of scattered.
L303035	u1479	m100	RENE	As if your mind's not all there.
L303034	u1475	m100	JOE	Disinterest?
L303033	u1479	m100	RENE	...and sort of...disinterest.
L303032	u1475	m100	JOE	It's not apparent.
L303031	u1479	m100	RENE	I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
L303029	u1479	m100	RENE	...I...don't know.
L303028	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303027	u1479	m100	RENE	I waited for you.
L303026	u1475	m100	JOE	Me still. They left you alone?
L303025	u1479	m100	RENE	You again.
L303004	u1479	m100	RENE	I just work for the travel firm.
L303003	u1475	m100	JOE	And you?
L302993	u1475	m100	JOE	Yes, of course.
L302992	u1479	m100	RENE	You mean from it.
L302860	u1479	m100	RENE	...Rene.
L302859	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait. What's your name?
L302856	u1479	m100	RENE	Like there's someone else here.
L302855	u1475	m100	JOE	What way?
L302854	u1479	m100	RENE	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
L302853	u1475	m100	JOE	What's so funny?
L302843	u1479	m100	RENE	Without what?
L302842	u1475	m100	JOE	Let you leave without it.
L302841	u1479	m100	RENE	Do what?
L302840	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't do that?
L302832	u1479	m100	RENE	Haven't seen you around.
L302831	u1475	m100	JOE	...right here too.
L302830	u1479	m100	RENE	And you.
L302824	u1479	m100	RENE	Oh...I can't. Business.
L302823	u1475	m100	JOE	Dinner...tonight.
L302822	u1479	m100	RENE	Where?
L302821	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll be right there.
L302815	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
L302814	u1479	m100	RENE	Blake said that?
L302811	u1479	m100	RENE	Yes?
L302810	u1475	m100	JOE	The poet...something he said...
L302809	u1479	m100	RENE	Blake?
L302808	u1475	m100	JOE	...Blake
L302806	u1479	m100	RENE	I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
L302805	u1475	m100	JOE	No. No one to speak of.
L302804	u1479	m100	RENE	Is someone else here?
L302799	u1475	m100	JOE	...I'm looking for someone.
L302798	u1479	m100	RENE	What do you do about what?
L303260	u1480	m100	RYUJI	I don't know.
L303259	u1475	m100	JOE	What about the others.
L303258	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
L303257	u1475	m100	JOE	Why'd you invite me here?
L303256	u1480	m100	RYUJI	We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
L303255	u1475	m100	JOE	Why are you on to him?
L303254	u1480	m100	RYUJI	I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
L303201	u1475	m100	JOE	Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
L303200	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Excuse me?
L303011	u1475	m100	JOE	...Piece of mind.
L303010	u1480	m100	RYUJI	What could you find in this place?
L302989	u1475	m100	JOE	It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
L302988	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Must be a fulfilling occupation.
L302188	u1475	m100	JOE	Thanks.
L302187	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
L302186	u1475	m100	JOE	A drink...
L302185	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	Is there anything else?
L302184	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
L302183	u1475	m100	JOE	I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
L302182	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
L302181	u1475	m100	JOE	Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
L302240	u1476	m100	LEADER	Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
L302239	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Mom...what are you doing here?
L302214	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Ahhh...Okay?!!!
L302213	u1476	m100	LEADER	Yes.
L302212	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Tear it apart?
L302211	u1476	m100	LEADER	That's alright. Just tear it apart.
L302210	u1482	m100	TECH 3	I can't get it out. It would take hours.
L302209	u1476	m100	LEADER	Could I have it, please.
L302208	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Just one. The back up.
L302207	u1476	m100	LEADER	It will be fine. You have another.
L302206	u1482	m100	TECH 3	It is?
L302205	u1476	m100	LEADER	It's alright.
L302204	u1482	m100	TECH 3	The experiment. The danger...
L302203	u1476	m100	LEADER	Why not?
L302202	u1482	m100	TECH 3	You can't take that.
L302201	u1476	m100	LEADER	Why?
L302200	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Wait.
L302228	u1481	m100	TECH 2	No?
L302227	u1476	m100	LEADER	It doesn't hurt.
L302226	u1481	m100	TECH 2	It will.
L302225	u1476	m100	LEADER	It'l be alright.
L302224	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Ow?...
L302223	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Perfectly.
L302222	u1476	m100	LEADER	The other working.
L302221	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Yes.
L302220	u1476	m100	LEADER	This the only spare?
L302199	u1476	m100	LEADER	Thank you.
L302198	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Right there.
L302574	u1482	m100	TECH 3	What about Al...
L302573	u1481	m100	TECH 2	So we better get started.
L302572	u1482	m100	TECH 3	It'l take months.
L302564	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Whoever took it does.
L302563	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Look, nobody knows we did it.
L302561	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Too much.
L302560	u1482	m100	TECH 3	What does he know?
L302559	u1481	m100	TECH 2	What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
L302258	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Poor bastard.
L302257	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Screw the PEM...What about Al...
L317672	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
L317671	u1631	m107	DALLAS	I don't have all day, kid.
L317669	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Alright, asshole.
L317668	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Okay, enough of this shit.
L317667	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Oh, come on!
L317666	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Yes it does.
L317665	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Asshole that does not count as a kill.
L317662	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
L317661	u1631	m107	DALLAS	He's not part of the program.
L317660	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Pause play.
L317659	u1631	m107	DALLAS	That sucks. Why won't he go down?
L317656	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Speaking of which, duck!
L317655	u1631	m107	DALLAS	You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
L317654	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	You got lucky.
L317653	u1631	m107	DALLAS	That's nine to four, geek-boy.
L317476	u1631	m107	DALLAS	Punk?
L317475	u1628	m107	AZRAEL	Watch it punk, I'm armed.
L318316	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
L318315	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
L318269	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Delongpre! Out of time!
L318268	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
L318243	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Done?
L318242	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
L318222	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We made it?
L318221	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Minimal.
L318182	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I don't know. Nothing.
L318181	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What?
L318180	u1639	m107	RIZZO	His mother?
L318151	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
L318150	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Can we blow it with just two?
L318124	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We don't have a choice!
L318123	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We can't lead him into the other hull!
L318042	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
L318041	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	When the left hull goes, so will the right.
L318024	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
L318023	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What's that?
L318011	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No.
L318010	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
L318009	u1639	m107	RIZZO	If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
L318008	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you doing?!!
L318006	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
L318005	u1639	m107	RIZZO	It's locked!
L317971	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Could you show a little compassion?!
L317970	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
L317969	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Goodbye old friend.
L317961	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We don't have time to argue!
L317960	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We're not leaving Crutch!
L317959	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
L317919	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What do you mean, not enough time?
L317918	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
L317782	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
L317781	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Duck fuckers?
L318306	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Get out of here!
L318305	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Sergeant!
L318250	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
L318249	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Can't shut em' down from here.
L318172	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo did.
L318171	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
L318163	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
L318162	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Bomb?
L318159	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
L318158	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Sergeant? We thought you were...
L318157	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
L318133	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He came for me, I had to run!
L318132	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where the hell were you?!!
L318120	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He....He...
L318119	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where have you been?!!
L317992	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, pull us in.
L317991	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Okay that hurt.
L317941	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Kkinsa! Open the doors!
L317940	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What?!
L317939	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Uh-oh.
L318291	u1640	m107	THORGAN	This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
L318290	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, suit up.
L318289	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Goodbye, my love.
L318187	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Let's move out!
L318186	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Done!
L318185	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Two more charges to go.
L318184	u1640	m107	THORGAN	As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
L318174	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you doing back?!!
L318173	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em!
L318094	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm coming, I'm coming.
L318093	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
L318062	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
L318061	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Hey! I'm not ready.
L318058	u1640	m107	THORGAN	They're back here.
L318057	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I'll need system four converters.
L318050	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	What are you gonna do, tell me?
L318049	u1640	m107	THORGAN	We're not supposed to do that.
L318002	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
L318001	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The hull's imploding!
L318000	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Shit!
L317965	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I think I broke my arm.
L317964	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Everyone okay?
L317914	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Where'd you get the gun?
L317913	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Better let me.
L317760	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
L317759	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You see that?
L317444	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	And you said high school was boring.
L317443	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Nice touch.
L317349	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Cool.
L317348	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Creepy.
L318311	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Hey, easy now.
L318310	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
L318309	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Boeman, the ships not here.
L318283	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Suit up.
L318282	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Earth II.
L318241	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	And now we're all out of it.
L318240	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It bought us some time.
L318211	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
L318210	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Hurry!
L318153	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I don't know!
L318152	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then what do we do?!
L318141	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then stop talking and work faster!
L318140	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
L318118	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
L318117	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Where is...?
L318070	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Thorgan? You coming?!
L318069	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
L318060	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
L318059	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	How many?
L318048	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	We could convert fission transistors.
L318047	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We'd need charges.
L317645	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
L317644	u1629	m107	BOEMAN	Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
L317797	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	What?
L317796	u1641	m107	YLLO	Sergeant!
L317777	u1641	m107	YLLO	But I didn't see...
L317776	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
L317775	u1641	m107	YLLO	Ok Sarge, what's your status?
L317745	u1641	m107	YLLO	Yeah yeah. Got it.
L317744	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You just keep an eye out.
L317743	u1641	m107	YLLO	Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
L317738	u1641	m107	YLLO	At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
L317737	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
L317719	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You got that right.
L317718	u1641	m107	YLLO	JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
L317717	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not a chance.
L317716	u1641	m107	YLLO	ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
L317707	u1641	m107	YLLO	Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
L317706	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Yllo, what's your head count?
L317615	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
L317614	u1641	m107	YLLO	Wait a minute...I need...
L317577	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
L317576	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	My job.
L317575	u1641	m107	YLLO	What the hell are you doing?
L317474	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
L317473	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Jesus what the hell is that?
L317472	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
L317471	u1641	m107	YLLO	I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
L317470	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
L317469	u1641	m107	YLLO	I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
L317468	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
L317467	u1641	m107	YLLO	Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
L317466	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
L317461	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
L317460	u1641	m107	YLLO	Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
L317459	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You're a teacher.
L317458	u1641	m107	YLLO	I am an expert!
L317457	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
L317453	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
L317452	u1641	m107	YLLO	Get them in the lab!
L318239	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
L318238	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	We need weapons.
L317712	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
L317711	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
L317710	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I need to know what you know about this guy.
L317692	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
L317691	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
L317686	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
L317685	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
L317639	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No, you're dead! You're all dead!
L317638	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
L317637	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Where is he?
L317636	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I'm with you kid.
L317769	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
L317768	u1636	m107	KICKER	Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
L317749	u1636	m107	KICKER	Negative.
L317748	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Kicker, anything?
L317723	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
L317722	u1636	m107	KICKER	Fuckin A...
L317721	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
L317703	u1636	m107	KICKER	Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
L317702	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
L317649	u1636	m107	KICKER	Oh man, what the hell happened?
L317648	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Jesus, God!
L318236	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	I'm pulling, damnit!
L318235	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Pull me in!
L318109	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
L318108	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
L318107	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
L318106	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
L318105	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Give me a break! What happened?
L318104	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
L318103	u1630	m107	BRODSKI	Where is everybody? What happened?
L318340	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I get it.
L318339	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
L318338	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Old woman?
L318337	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No thank you, you crazy old woman.
L318336	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
L318335	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You okay?!
L318333	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'm stuck!
L318332	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, pull away!
L318330	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I know you.
L318329	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Delongpre, you don't even know me.
L318326	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I think so, why?
L318325	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Did you like it?
L318324	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I think I had some when I was eight.
L318323	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
L318321	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
L318320	u1639	m107	RIZZO	No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
L318319	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, you okay?
L318314	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You'll be fine.
L318313	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Okay, good tip.
L318312	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You wanna release your air tanks?
L318294	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Eat me.
L318293	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
L318292	u1639	m107	RIZZO	His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
L318278	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Oh sure, all the time.
L318277	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Got it.  You ever space walked?
L318256	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
L318255	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You?
L318254	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
L318232	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Not so bad.
L318231	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	See? We're not so bad.
L318100	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
L318099	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I couldn't save them.
L318098	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	And what happend to ...?
L318097	u1639	m107	RIZZO	They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
L318089	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Were you close to your father?
L318088	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
L318081	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
L318080	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I thought you meant...
L318079	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
L318078	u1639	m107	RIZZO	So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
L318077	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's why I'm here.
L318038	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
L318037	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What's this?
L318036	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hey!!
L318035	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
L318034	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hey.
L318013	u1639	m107	RIZZO	It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
L318012	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo?!
L317988	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	What if we don't?
L317987	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What if you miss?
L317958	u1639	m107	RIZZO	400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
L317957	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We're screwed!
L317948	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I guessed.
L317947	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Med-kit?
L317946	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
L317944	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
L317943	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
L317934	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No you don't!
L317933	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
L317924	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys!!! The shuttle?
L317923	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
L317830	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
L317829	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Rizzo, he's out there.
L317784	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
L317783	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Outta here?
L317694	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I hope so.
L317693	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
L317688	u1639	m107	RIZZO	We have to get off this ship.
L317687	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Where are you going?
L317855	u1641	m107	YLLO	They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
L317854	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
L317853	u1641	m107	YLLO	Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
L317852	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
L317851	u1641	m107	YLLO	We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
L317820	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	No shit. I got no problem with that.
L317819	u1641	m107	YLLO	Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
L317635	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Oh I like her a lot.
L317634	u1641	m107	YLLO	God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
L317629	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
L317628	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
L317627	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	That's really funny.
L317626	u1641	m107	YLLO	More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
L317625	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	She needs a little time.
L317624	u1641	m107	YLLO	Well?
L317591	u1641	m107	YLLO	She broke my fucking nose!
L317590	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Spunky . . .
L317574	u1641	m107	YLLO	I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
L317573	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
L317572	u1641	m107	YLLO	It's time.
L317529	u1641	m107	YLLO	We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
L317528	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Now what?
L318328	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Shut up, Thorgan!
L318327	u1640	m107	THORGAN	He's trying to ask you out on a date.
L318300	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Well, do something!
L318299	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
L318285	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
L318284	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I'll help you in.
L318275	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Just come on, I've got an idea.
L318274	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Okay?!!
L318245	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Again?! Jesus!
L318244	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kaboom.
L318092	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm on my way.
L318091	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
L317928	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
L317927	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
L317894	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	He's right behind us!
L317893	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
L317863	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	We're screwed.
L317862	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yuck.
L317818	u1640	m107	THORGAN	She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
L317817	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Now hold on! We should hear her out!
L318215	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	NO!
L318214	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Close the fucking door!
L318213	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	They'll make it.
L318212	u1634	m107	JANESSA	They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
L318149	u1634	m107	JANESSA	He was chasing me!
L318148	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	You lost the charge?
L318147	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I...I don't know what I did...
L317983	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
L317982	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Push off toward us.
L318288	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
L318287	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
L318248	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
L318247	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	You must shut down the engines.
L318055	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
L318054	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Now this is getting exciting.
L317891	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	GO, GO, GO!
L317890	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Now that's just gross.
L317518	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
L317517	u1632	m107	DELONGPRE	And what's with the headgear?
L317774	u1641	m107	YLLO	Thank you.
L317773	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
L317772	u1641	m107	YLLO	We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
L317771	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
L317770	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
L317446	u1641	m107	YLLO	Just get us to the ship!
L317445	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
L317357	u1641	m107	YLLO	Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
L317356	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
L317329	u1633	m107	FAT LOU	Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
L317328	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'm missing two!
L318064	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You're leaving me here alone?
L318063	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You're so bossy.
L318053	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Would you?
L318052	u1634	m107	JANESSA	YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
L318030	u1634	m107	JANESSA	A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
L318029	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
L318015	u1634	m107	JANESSA	So what else is new?
L318014	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Hurry! She's lost it!
L317998	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Let's just get out of here.
L317997	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
L317985	u1634	m107	JANESSA	That ought'a help the situation.
L317984	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I'm gonna spew.
L317516	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Small brains make your balls itch?
L317515	u1640	m107	THORGAN	This is what it means right here.
L317875	u1641	m107	YLLO	Crutch?
L317874	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What do we do?!!
L317835	u1641	m107	YLLO	Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
L317834	u1634	m107	JANESSA	What are you doing?
L317814	u1641	m107	YLLO	Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
L317813	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
L317641	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Oh my God! Adrienne?
L317640	u1641	m107	YLLO	Jesus!
L317542	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You prefer an apple?
L317541	u1641	m107	YLLO	Later.
L317540	u1634	m107	JANESSA	You're quicker than usual.
L318161	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
L318160	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I don't know...sorry?
L318046	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
L318045	u1634	m107	JANESSA	I'm just saying.
L318044	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
L318028	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
L318027	u1634	m107	JANESSA	No.
L318017	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
L318016	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
L317647	u1634	m107	JANESSA	Maybe she tripped.
L317646	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
L318177	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
L318176	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You killed him?
L318175	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
L318026	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Are there any other shuttles?
L318025	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
L317732	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	You need to get laid!
L317731	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I'm surrounded by idiots.
L317730	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I'm afraid I cannot assist.
L317729	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
L317728	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
L317727	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Barbie from hell...
L317726	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Kay-em 14.
L317725	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Robot huh?
L318345	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I love you.
L318344	u1640	m107	THORGAN	I missed you too.
L318343	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
L318342	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-em you okay?
L318225	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
L318224	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em we made it!
L318179	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
L318178	u1640	m107	THORGAN	You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
L318135	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
L318134	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Kay-Em, you okay?
L318127	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Oh, alright.
L318126	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
L318125	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Do I have to?
L318084	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Good point.
L318083	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Who are you apologizing to?
L318082	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Sorry, sorry.
L318074	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
L318073	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
L318072	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Ow!
L318071	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Almost done.
L318067	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
L318066	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	It's just you and me, then.
L318033	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Sory...
L318032	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Am I in there?
L318031	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
L317953	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Oh shit! There he is!
L317952	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	I didn't say I was good at it.
L317383	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
L317382	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
L317339	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
L317338	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
L317337	u1635	m107	KAY-EM 14	The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
L317431	u1641	m107	YLLO	No! He's coming with us!
L317430	u1636	m107	KICKER	Leave him behind!
L317411	u1636	m107	KICKER	Defense droids. I'm on it.
L317410	u1641	m107	YLLO	Kicker!
L317376	u1641	m107	YLLO	This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
L317375	u1636	m107	KICKER	Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
L317374	u1641	m107	YLLO	Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
L317334	u1636	m107	KICKER	Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
L317333	u1641	m107	YLLO	We're missing two of the kids!
L317332	u1636	m107	KICKER	Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
L317898	u1637	m107	KKINSA	But?!!
L317897	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I gotta go back.
L317896	u1637	m107	KKINSA	What?!!
L317895	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
L317873	u1637	m107	KKINSA	Thirty seconds.
L317872	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Then open the doors!
L317871	u1637	m107	KKINSA	The power's back up!
L317858	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Keep trying!
L317857	u1637	m107	KKINSA	Something's wrong.
L317850	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I just know.
L317849	u1637	m107	KKINSA	How do you know?
L317846	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Ssh.
L317845	u1637	m107	KKINSA	What?
L317801	u1639	m107	RIZZO	He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
L317800	u1637	m107	KKINSA	I don't understand...what does he want?
L317553	u1638	m107	PEREZ	See you then . . . doctor.
L317552	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
L317551	u1638	m107	PEREZ	If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
L317550	u1641	m107	YLLO	Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
L317549	u1638	m107	PEREZ	Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
L317548	u1641	m107	YLLO	Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
L317547	u1638	m107	PEREZ	Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
L317546	u1641	m107	YLLO	I'm sending you the files.
L317545	u1641	m107	YLLO	We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
L317544	u1638	m107	PEREZ	You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
L317889	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Three...two...one...
L317888	u1641	m107	YLLO	It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
L317828	u1641	m107	YLLO	You're crazy!
L317827	u1639	m107	RIZZO	How do you open the damn door?
L317816	u1641	m107	YLLO	4You're not going anywhere.
L317815	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys, please come with me!
L317812	u1639	m107	RIZZO	That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
L317811	u1641	m107	YLLO	Scientists. Very intellegent men.
L317810	u1639	m107	RIZZO	More soldiers?
L317809	u1641	m107	YLLO	They can deal with this sort of thing.
L317808	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What good will that do?
L317805	u1641	m107	YLLO	Are we locked down?
L317804	u1639	m107	RIZZO	You wanna die?
L317803	u1641	m107	YLLO	You're not going anywhere.
L317690	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
L317689	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
L317675	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Get him out of there!
L317674	u1641	m107	YLLO	Azrael can you repeat that?
L317652	u1639	m107	RIZZO	I didn't say he was alive.
L317651	u1641	m107	YLLO	Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
L317650	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
L317633	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Are you finished?
L317632	u1641	m107	YLLO	Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
L317631	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Jason? He's on this ship?!
L317612	u1641	m107	YLLO	That's right, now if you could...
L317611	u1639	m107	RIZZO	But...I...400 years?
L317610	u1641	m107	YLLO	We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L317605	u1639	m107	RIZZO	JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
L317604	u1641	m107	YLLO	Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
L317602	u1639	m107	RIZZO	30? How long was I out?
L317601	u1641	m107	YLLO	We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
L317600	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
L317599	u1641	m107	YLLO	Nanotechnology.
L317598	u1639	m107	RIZZO	How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
L317596	u1641	m107	YLLO	Obviously so.
L317595	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
L318273	u1640	m107	THORGAN	It's okay.
L318272	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Guys, he's right behind us!
L318040	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Sure but what good will that do?
L318039	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Can we get through these?
L317826	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
L317825	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
L317780	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
L317779	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Yes!
L317752	u1640	m107	THORGAN	Exactly.
L317751	u1639	m107	RIZZO	So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
L317643	u1639	m107	RIZZO	What have I done?! Idiots.
L317642	u1640	m107	THORGAN	What have you done?
L317609	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Old Earth?
L317608	u1640	m107	THORGAN	He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
L317607	u1639	m107	RIZZO	Hockey player? He's not a ...
L317606	u1640	m107	THORGAN	The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
L338835	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338834	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That's a better one.
L338820	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That way. I can feel the cold.
L338819	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the Arctic ice.
L338791	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
L338790	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338787	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I knew you would come.
L338786	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
L338785	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Yes.
L338782	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All directions are the same here.
L338781	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Take the western passage.
L338778	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
L338777	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know how.
L338776	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Will your power outward.
L338772	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All the passages are guarded.
L338771	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You must move away from the Center.
L338770	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338385	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
L338384	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
L338383	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I know it.
L338382	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find you. I will be with you.
L338381	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
L338380	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where is the Fortress?
L338379	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338378	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338281	u1715	m113	LYSSA	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
L338280	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
L338278	u1715	m113	LYSSA	No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
L338277	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Have they harmed you?
L338276	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn.
L338275	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338216	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't wait either.
L338215	u1715	m113	LYSSA	About what?
L338214	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I lied.
L338213	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I can't.
L338212	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Thank you, but I can wait.
L338211	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
L338210	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
L338209	u1715	m113	LYSSA	There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
L338204	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never mind my ears! Go away!
L338203	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
L338188	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
L338187	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
L338186	u1715	m113	LYSSA	We're almost married.
L338185	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>What</u>?
L338184	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
L338183	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I have no intention of getting used to it.
L338182	u1712	m113	COLWYN	If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
L338181	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
L338180	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Well, you're beautiful.
L338179	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
L338178	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That's worse.
L338177	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
L338176	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
L338175	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Me too.
L338174	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
L338173	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
L338172	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't have to go through with it either.
L338171	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
L338236	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
L338235	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
L338234	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
L338233	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I won't leave you here.
L338232	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will go alone.
L338230	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
L338229	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They have Lyssa!
L338219	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Of course it was.
L338218	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
L338217	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
L338804	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I forbid you!
L338803	u1725	m113	YNYR	I can. Because I choose it.
L338802	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No! You cannot know that!
L338801	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
L338800	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You're coming with us.
L338799	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
L338798	u1725	m113	YNYR	Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
L338797	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
L338796	u1725	m113	YNYR	Use your sword.
L338795	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can see the Beast!
L338794	u1725	m113	YNYR	I chose the wrong passage.
L338793	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
L338784	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where the spiral begins.
L338783	u1725	m113	YNYR	The spiral begins in the west.
L338774	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
L338773	u1725	m113	YNYR	She must make a glaive.
L338768	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
L338767	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Beast will kill her.
L338766	u1725	m113	YNYR	They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
L338721	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Let us wish him peace.
L338720	u1725	m113	YNYR	He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
L338560	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
L338559	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
L338558	u1725	m113	YNYR	From here, I must go alone.
L338551	u1725	m113	YNYR	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
L338550	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
L338548	u1725	m113	YNYR	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
L338547	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
L338525	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338524	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
L338523	u1725	m113	YNYR	You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
L338522	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never.
L338521	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. She must agree of her own free will.
L338520	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Can she be forced?
L338519	u1725	m113	YNYR	Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
L338518	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
L338517	u1725	m113	YNYR	He has come for Lyssa.
L338516	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338515	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
L338514	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
L338458	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will know, in good time.
L338457	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But you suspect.
L338456	u1725	m113	YNYR	I'm not sure.
L338455	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>Why</u>?
L338454	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
L338453	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
L338450	u1725	m113	YNYR	She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
L338449	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot reach her.
L338390	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find her!
L338389	u1725	m113	YNYR	The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
L338388	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
L338387	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
L338386	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
L338377	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
L338376	u1725	m113	YNYR	What do you see?
L338375	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't reach her.
L338367	u1725	m113	YNYR	Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
L338366	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They know when they're going to die?
L338325	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
L338324	u1725	m113	YNYR	You choose these?
L338294	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
L338293	u1725	m113	YNYR	You have not slept in two days.
L338292	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
L338291	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
L338290	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
L338289	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
L338288	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Fortress moves?
L338287	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
L338286	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
L338285	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
L338274	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338273	u1725	m113	YNYR	Reach out farther. Call to her.
L338272	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There is nothing.
L338269	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You won't have to.
L338268	u1725	m113	YNYR	I am too old to climb down a rope.
L338267	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have rope?
L338266	u1725	m113	YNYR	But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
L338264	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But there is another entrance to this place.
L338263	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way.
L338262	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
L338261	u1725	m113	YNYR	With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
L338259	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the old books. It's called a glaive.
L338258	u1725	m113	YNYR	Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
L338257	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have no extraordinary powers.
L338256	u1725	m113	YNYR	This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
L338254	u1725	m113	YNYR	I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
L338253	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
L338252	u1725	m113	YNYR	Turold's son was to marry her.
L338251	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The new Queen lives.
L338250	u1725	m113	YNYR	Does the Queen live?
L338249	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The White Castle has fallen.
L338719	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Each to his fate.
L338718	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Each to his fate.
L338714	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Yes. It is today.
L338713	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It is today?
L338705	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Saddles.
L338704	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I road them often in my youth.
L338703	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have done it?
L338702	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	They can be saddled.
L338542	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What will happen?
L338541	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Do not let the waters touch you.
L338537	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We must enter the swamp.
L338536	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Slayers!
L338501	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
L338500	u1712	m113	COLWYN	How did you know?
L338689	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot.
L338688	u1722	m113	VELLA	You will not, then?
L338687	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
L338686	u1722	m113	VELLA	One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
L338685	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot betray my bride.
L338684	u1722	m113	VELLA	Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
L338683	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
L338682	u1722	m113	VELLA	Let me comfort you.
L338681	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I ache with it.
L338680	u1722	m113	VELLA	You too are lonely.
L338668	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338667	u1722	m113	VELLA	Even by you?
L338666	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338665	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
L338664	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338663	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not worth returning to?
L338662	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think that.
L338661	u1722	m113	VELLA	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
L338660	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know the cruelty of such a fate.
L338576	u1714	m113	ERGO	What else is left for a man without friends.
L338575	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You and I will guard the fire.
L338574	u1714	m113	ERGO	Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
L338411	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
L338410	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
L338408	u1714	m113	ERGO	No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
L338407	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have need of friends.
L338406	u1714	m113	ERGO	My <u>friend</u>.
L338405	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I was hoping I might be your friend.
L338404	u1714	m113	ERGO	Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
L338371	u1712	m113	COLWYN	He saved our lives.
L338370	u1714	m113	ERGO	Once is enough, thank you.
L338309	u1714	m113	ERGO	Staying alive.
L338308	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What business?
L338307	u1714	m113	ERGO	I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
L338302	u1714	m113	ERGO	For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
L338301	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Perhaps he expected to eat it.
L338300	u1714	m113	ERGO	Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
L338299	u1712	m113	COLWYN	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
L338298	u1714	m113	ERGO	It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
L338297	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
L338296	u1714	m113	ERGO	Help! Help! I'm drowning!
L338824	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
L338823	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
L338822	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
L338744	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Perhaps. If the pay is good.
L338743	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
L338742	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
L338741	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Naturally.
L338740	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Subject to the King, no doubt.
L338739	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
L338723	u1712	m113	COLWYN	At the gallop!
L338722	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
L338701	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
L338700	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We could reach it on fire-mares.
L338573	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes, my lord.
L338572	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go. I command you.
L338571	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
L338570	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
L338569	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	What kind of friend do you think I am?
L338568	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go, join them.
L338557	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
L338556	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
L338484	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A flicker of talent.
L338483	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Hand over your dinner.
L338482	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
L338481	u1712	m113	COLWYN	These we'll pay for.
L338480	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
L338479	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We must try to get horses.
L338478	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You've eaten nothing.
L338416	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
L338415	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, I'm not impressed.
L338394	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
L338393	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
L338352	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No.
L338351	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Not sleepy, either?
L338350	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm not hungry.
L338347	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
L338346	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
L338345	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm all right.
L338344	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	When did you last sleep, boy?
L338334	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
L338333	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That I promise you.
L338332	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It should be an interesting journey, then.
L338331	u1712	m113	COLWYN	To the place where Death lives.
L338330	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And where do you lead, boy?
L338329	u1712	m113	COLWYN	So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
L338328	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
L338327	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will follow me.
L338326	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
L338323	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know you.
L338322	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Hah! You don't know me, boy.
L338321	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
L338320	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	How did you know I had sons?
L338319	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame is what you leave to your sons.
L338318	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
L338317	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame.
L338316	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
L338315	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think you'll grow careless.
L338716	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	And mine goes with you.
L338715	u1714	m113	ERGO	My heart stays here.
L338712	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I cannot go with you, my friend.
L338711	u1714	m113	ERGO	Quell?
L338632	u1714	m113	ERGO	And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
L338631	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	A small house.
L338630	u1714	m113	ERGO	A venison pie as big as a house.
L338566	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	No.
L338565	u1714	m113	ERGO	Can't I come, too?
L338564	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We'll meet you at the inn.
L338563	u1714	m113	ERGO	Where are you going?
L338535	u1714	m113	ERGO	I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
L338534	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
L338533	u1714	m113	ERGO	What is that awful looking place?
L338467	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I am Quell.
L338466	u1714	m113	ERGO	Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
L338465	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
L338464	u1714	m113	ERGO	You!
L338463	u1714	m113	ERGO	A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
L338462	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Would you settle for a boar?
L338461	u1714	m113	ERGO	Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
L338758	u1714	m113	ERGO	No, no. I'm with you, boy.
L338757	u1719	m113	TITCH	Would you desert your friends?
L338756	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
L338634	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
L338633	u1719	m113	TITCH	We meant only to please you.
L338629	u1719	m113	TITCH	It's right behind you.
L338628	u1714	m113	ERGO	Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
L338627	u1719	m113	TITCH	I don't think it's working.
L338626	u1714	m113	ERGO	What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
L338625	u1714	m113	ERGO	First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
L338624	u1719	m113	TITCH	Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
L338490	u1714	m113	ERGO	A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
L338489	u1719	m113	TITCH	I only want one.
L338488	u1714	m113	ERGO	One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
L338487	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'd wish for a puppy.
L338486	u1714	m113	ERGO	If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
L338469	u1714	m113	ERGO	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
L338468	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'm hungry.
L338448	u1719	m113	TITCH	I ...  ... am Titch.
L338447	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
L338446	u1719	m113	TITCH	You can have half.
L338445	u1714	m113	ERGO	You do?
L338444	u1719	m113	TITCH	I have a cinnamon bar.
L338443	u1714	m113	ERGO	What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
L338442	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338441	u1714	m113	ERGO	Sugarballs?
L338440	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338439	u1714	m113	ERGO	Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
L338637	u1714	m113	ERGO	No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
L338636	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look at its insides.
L338635	u1714	m113	ERGO	Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
L338554	u1714	m113	ERGO	Hush!
L338553	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I can't hold the weight of both of you!
L338477	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
L338476	u1714	m113	ERGO	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
L338475	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Passable, pimple, very passable.
L338374	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Oh, my poor stomach.
L338373	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, my poor stew!
L338361	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
L338360	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am being exploited! Where are you going?
L338359	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
L338358	u1714	m113	ERGO	Food for crows.
L338357	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We have plenty of hares.
L338356	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I live on air?
L338355	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
L338354	u1714	m113	ERGO	What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
L338342	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
L338341	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You had better manners as a pig.
L338340	u1714	m113	ERGO	Put me down, you lout!
L338312	u1714	m113	ERGO	Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
L338311	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
L338710	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. He will master the leader.
L338709	u1714	m113	ERGO	They'll trample him to death!
L338403	u1714	m113	ERGO	Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
L338402	u1725	m113	YNYR	He is the King.
L338401	u1714	m113	ERGO	And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
L338400	u1725	m113	YNYR	He didn't join them. They joined him.
L338365	u1725	m113	YNYR	If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
L338364	u1714	m113	ERGO	He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
L338363	u1725	m113	YNYR	The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
L338362	u1714	m113	ERGO	One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
L338306	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
L338305	u1725	m113	YNYR	The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
L338304	u1714	m113	ERGO	My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
L338697	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	He will not come. You will be my queen.
L338696	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will come for me.
L338679	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then he will die!
L338678	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will not!
L338677	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
L338676	u1715	m113	LYSSA	It's a lie!
L338675	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then look!
L338674	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
L338653	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
L338652	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your power. It is hideous.
L338208	u1716	m113	QUEEN	They will have the life that you and I might have had.
L338207	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A fine match.
L338206	u1716	m113	QUEEN	A match for your son, I think.
L338205	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
L338200	u1721	m113	TUROLD	That I am, my lady.
L338199	u1716	m113	QUEEN	You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
L338198	u1721	m113	TUROLD	I knew.
L338197	u1716	m113	QUEEN	I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
L338196	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Yes.
L338195	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It is important to assure the succession.
L338194	u1716	m113	QUEEN	For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
L338191	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
L338190	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
L338166	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
L338165	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
L338164	u1721	m113	TUROLD	The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
L338163	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
L338162	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
L338161	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Freylag's stronghold?
L338160	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
L338159	u1716	m113	QUEEN	What news from our friends?
L338193	u1721	m113	TUROLD	He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
L338192	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Modred! Impossible!
L338151	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
L338150	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
L338149	u1721	m113	TUROLD	How many did you lose?
L338148	u1717	m113	ROWAN	I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
L338147	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
L338146	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Yes. We lost five.
L338145	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were attacked in the forest?
L338438	u1718	m113	SEER	They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
L338437	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
L338429	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
L338428	u1718	m113	SEER	Can you see?
L338427	u1718	m113	SEER	I will seek the Fortress for you.
L338426	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the time.
L338425	u1718	m113	SEER	Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
L338424	u1725	m113	YNYR	You know the voice.
L338423	u1718	m113	SEER	With an old voice?
L338422	u1725	m113	YNYR	The new King.
L338421	u1718	m113	SEER	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
L338420	u1725	m113	YNYR	We seek the Fortress of Krull.
L338808	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That is true.
L338807	u1725	m113	YNYR	Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
L338764	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is too late. He has drunk.
L338763	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Kegan!
L338736	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
L338735	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look.
L338734	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
L338733	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
L338699	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It's a hundred leagues from here.
L338698	u1725	m113	YNYR	We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
L338562	u1725	m113	YNYR	Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
L338561	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Each to his fate, lad.
L338539	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fewer will survive them.
L338538	u1725	m113	YNYR	Few have survived it.
L338513	u1725	m113	YNYR	She had another name once.
L338512	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Her name is Death.
L338511	u1725	m113	YNYR	Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
L338510	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	She has the power to kill.
L338509	u1725	m113	YNYR	She has the power of vision.
L338508	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
L338507	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338506	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The Widow of the Web?
L338505	u1725	m113	YNYR	I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
L338452	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
L338451	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The leader of the Dark Ones?
L338397	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
L338396	u1725	m113	YNYR	Many have perished in that maze.
L338395	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
L338392	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
L338391	u1725	m113	YNYR	We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
L338369	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
L338368	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Knowledge I wouldn't want.
L338622	u1724	m113	WIDOW	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
L338621	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will come with me.
L338620	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
L338619	u1725	m113	YNYR	I cannot stop the sand.
L338616	u1725	m113	YNYR	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
L338615	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It will not help.
L338614	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
L338613	u1725	m113	YNYR	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
L338612	u1724	m113	WIDOW	No.
L338611	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
L338610	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You lie!
L338609	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
L338608	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Why must you know?
L338607	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
L338606	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Of what?
L338605	u1725	m113	YNYR	Knowledge.
L338604	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
L338603	u1725	m113	YNYR	Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
L338602	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Yes.
L338601	u1725	m113	YNYR	You see?
L338600	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
L338599	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is no trickery.
L338598	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Do not try your trickery on me!
L338597	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
L338596	u1725	m113	YNYR	Where is he? My son.
L338595	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
L338594	u1725	m113	YNYR	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
L338593	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had a son.
L338592	u1725	m113	YNYR	We had no children.
L338591	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She bore you many children?
L338590	u1725	m113	YNYR	No, she was not as beautiful.
L338589	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She was not as beautiful.
L338588	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
L338587	u1724	m113	WIDOW	But you would not stay with me.
L338586	u1725	m113	YNYR	The most beautiful woman in the world.
L338585	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I was beautiful then.
L338584	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
L338583	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It is fifty years since I heard that name.
L338582	u1725	m113	YNYR	Ynyr!
L338581	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Who speaks that name!
L352677	u1853	m122	BILLY	Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
L352676	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
L352675	u1853	m122	BILLY	Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
L352674	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
L352673	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
L352672	u1853	m122	BILLY	For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
L352671	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I feel sorry for you, boy!
L352670	u1853	m122	BILLY	I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
L352669	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm a Sandman!
L352890	u1854	m122	BOX	Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
L352889	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What other food?
L352888	u1854	m122	BOX	Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
L352887	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How did they get in here?
L352885	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We're ready.
L352884	u1854	m122	BOX	Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
L352883	u1859	m122	LOGAN	All right. Now you keep your bargain.
L352877	u1854	m122	BOX	Up there.
L352876	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How do you want us?
L352873	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It'll be all right...
L352872	u1854	m122	BOX	Nude. Imagine, a pair.
L352871	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That's better.  How do you want us?
L352870	u1854	m122	BOX	Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
L352869	u1859	m122	LOGAN	There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
L352868	u1854	m122	BOX	Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
L352867	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Answer the question!
L352864	u1854	m122	BOX	You're a beautiful pair.
L352863	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Where do you send them?
L352862	u1854	m122	BOX	Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
L352861	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
L352860	u1854	m122	BOX	Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
L352859	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
L352858	u1854	m122	BOX	Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
L352857	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
L352856	u1854	m122	BOX	From? From? From?
L352855	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Where do you think we came from?
L352854	u1854	m122	BOX	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
L352853	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How do you think we got here??!!
L352849	u1854	m122	BOX	Anything to eat?
L352848	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
L352845	u1854	m122	BOX	Your turn.
L352844	u1859	m122	LOGAN	All right -- what are you?
L352843	u1854	m122	BOX	Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
L352751	u1855	m122	DOC	Hurry... hurry... hurry.
L352750	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I don't care... Just get it over with.
L352749	u1855	m122	DOC	Do you have anything special in mind?
L352735	u1855	m122	DOC	Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
L352734	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Just the face.
L352733	u1855	m122	DOC	I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
L352732	u1855	m122	DOC	And I did it myself right on there.
L352731	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Your own work?
L352730	u1855	m122	DOC	I am.
L352729	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
L352728	u1855	m122	DOC	It's a real privilege, Sandman.
L353025	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Why did you do that???!!!
L353024	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
L353023	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Why did you do that??!!
L352767	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
L352766	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It has nothing to do with you.
L352765	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	What's going on, Logan?!
L352559	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	At Carousel tonight?
L352558	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm fine...  See you...
L352557	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
L352556	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Anybody we know?
L352555	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Of course.
L352554	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Did you?
L352553	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
L352552	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Did you ever see anybody renew?
L352551	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	What the hell took you so long?
L352523	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
L352522	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	You? Why? You're already beautiful.
L352521	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
L352460	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
L352459	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That was a great shot you made.
L352457	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	I'm in my party mood.
L352456	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Who invited you?
L352449	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Only a few? You're just not trying.
L352448	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
L352444	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
L352443	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
L352442	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
L352441	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
L352439	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Well... you can't have them all.
L352438	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	You missed something special.
L352425	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
L352424	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
L352423	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
L352422	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Did you ever see Francis-8?
L352416	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
L352415	u1859	m122	LOGAN	"No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that ""one for one"" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape."
L352414	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
L352413	u1859	m122	LOGAN	"But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. ""One for one. One for one."""
L352412	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
L352411	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Just wondered... what happens?
L352410	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Why?
L352409	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Not in my time...
L352408	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
L352407	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
L352404	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Even the alarm didn't wake him.
L352403	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Had enough?
L352396	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
L352395	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
L352394	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
L352393	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
L352392	u1856	m122	FRANCIS	You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
L352802	u1857	m122	HOLLY	Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
L352801	u1858	m122	JESSICA	...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
L352800	u1857	m122	HOLLY	That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
L352799	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
L352798	u1857	m122	HOLLY	He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
L352797	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
L352796	u1857	m122	HOLLY	It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
L352664	u1861	m122	MARY	I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
L352663	u1858	m122	JESSICA	When do you go up?
L352662	u1861	m122	MARY	I'm very smart.
L352661	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Why aren't you in Nursery?
L352660	u1861	m122	MARY	Here.
L352659	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Where do you live, Mary?
L352658	u1861	m122	MARY	I'm Mary 2.
L352657	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What's your name?
L353082	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
L353081	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Is it inside the city?
L353080	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
L353079	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What does that water do?
L353078	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Beloved wife...
L353077	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Beloved husband...
L353076	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
L353075	u1858	m122	JESSICA	And Sanctuary?
L353074	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
L353073	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Beloved son...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
L353051	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
L353050	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
L353049	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
L353048	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Things change!
L353047	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
L353046	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
L353045	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
L353044	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
L353043	u1858	m122	JESSICA	To what?
L353042	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We can't. We're going back.
L353041	u1858	m122	JESSICA	He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
L353040	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
L353012	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
L353011	u1859	m122	LOGAN	"No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes ""real"". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope."
L353010	u1858	m122	JESSICA	There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
L353009	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You want there to be one... that doesn't...
L353008	u1858	m122	JESSICA	There's a Sanctuary... there is!
L353004	u1859	m122	LOGAN	One in a million, I suppose
L353003	u1858	m122	JESSICA	He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
L353002	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
L352939	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It could be...
L352938	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
L352934	u1858	m122	JESSICA	"Beloved Husband. ""Beloved Wife"". What can all that mean?"
L352933	u1859	m122	LOGAN	They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
L352930	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
L352929	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
L352928	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Then the answer's yes...
L352927	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Of course.
L352926	u1858	m122	JESSICA	...But I still have the choice...?
L352925	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You know, Jessica.
L352924	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
L352923	u1859	m122	LOGAN	The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
L352922	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What does it mean?
L352920	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
L352919	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
L352918	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
L352917	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
L352916	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Do you think he was telling the Truth?
L352915	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It all seemed to make sense until Box.
L352914	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I won't.
L352913	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Don't ever let go.
L352912	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I doubt it.
L352911	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
L352909	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
L352908	u1858	m122	JESSICA	It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
L352906	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
L352905	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Don't!
L352904	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We'll be all right...  We will...
L352903	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I hate outside! I hate it!
L352901	u1858	m122	JESSICA	And yours.
L352900	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
L352899	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What's that?
L352841	u1858	m122	JESSICA	For us.
L352840	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
L352839	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
L352838	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
L352837	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
L352836	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
L352835	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You're really one of us now, aren't you?
L352834	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It doesn't make any difference anymore.
L352833	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
L352831	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
L352830	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'm afraid.
L352826	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
L352825	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
L352824	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What do you suppose this was...?
L352823	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It's the only way.
L352822	u1858	m122	JESSICA	How do we know this is the right way?
L352815	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
L352814	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Will you take me with you?
L352783	u1858	m122	JESSICA	They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
L352782	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How will they know we're coming?
L352781	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
L352779	u1858	m122	JESSICA	We'll convince them.
L352778	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
L352777	u1858	m122	JESSICA	They won't listen.
L352776	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
L352775	u1858	m122	JESSICA	They won't believe us.
L352774	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
L352773	u1858	m122	JESSICA	He's good, isn't he?
L352772	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
L352771	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
L352770	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Are you taking me to them?
L352706	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No. Not that either.
L352705	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
L352704	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I -- I can't.
L352703	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
L352702	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
L352701	u1859	m122	LOGAN	All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
L352700	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
L352699	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
L352698	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
L352654	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Muscle? I don't know that one.
L352653	u1859	m122	LOGAN	The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
L352652	u1858	m122	JESSICA	But what is this -- why?
L352651	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
L352646	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Let's see -- how long has it been?
L352645	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
L352644	u1859	m122	LOGAN	When did you begin to question Lastday?
L352643	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I have.
L352642	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Uh-uh.
L352641	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
L352640	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
L352639	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Some people say children need human mothering.
L352638	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
L352637	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
L352636	u1859	m122	LOGAN	They're like beasts. Wild.
L352634	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That's nice.
L352633	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'd rather be with you.
L352632	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
L352631	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You're not going, are you?
L352630	u1859	m122	LOGAN	A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
L352627	u1858	m122	JESSICA	We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
L352626	u1859	m122	LOGAN	If you trusted me, you'd know.
L352625	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Of course --
L352624	u1859	m122	LOGAN	If you did know, you'd tell me.
L352623	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I wish I knew what you think I know.
L352622	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Maybe you'll think of something...
L352621	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I wish I could help you.
L352620	u1859	m122	LOGAN	That's tomorrow.
L352619	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What're you going to do?
L352618	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What do you need?
L352617	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Are you here to help me?
L352594	u1859	m122	LOGAN	And I never heard of Sanctuary.
L352593	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
L352592	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I don't have much time.
L352591	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Please? What friends?
L352590	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
L352589	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I don't..
L352588	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I let him go... believe me.
L352587	u1858	m122	JESSICA	And then you killed him, right?
L352586	u1859	m122	LOGAN	A Runner gave it to me.
L352585	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Where did you get that?
L352584	u1858	m122	JESSICA	How can I?
L352583	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It's different now. Help me.
L352582	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
L352581	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Both... running's what I'm interested in.
L352580	u1858	m122	JESSICA	About running, dying what?
L352579	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You know something.
L352578	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Why tell me?
L352577	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm going to run.
L352576	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Why show me?
L352575	u1859	m122	LOGAN	All right.
L352574	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I don't believe you. There has to be more.
L352573	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You know.
L352572	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
L352571	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Then it's still no.
L352570	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Of course.
L352569	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Thanks... but I have the choice.
L352568	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Maybe... sure...
L352567	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
L352566	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I couldn't get you out of my mind.
L352565	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Here I am.  Shall I come in?
L352564	u1859	m122	LOGAN	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
L352563	u1858	m122	JESSICA	You could have called me yourself.
L352510	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You're sure you don't want to try?
L352509	u1858	m122	JESSICA	K.
L352508	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What Quad do you live in?
L352507	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
L352506	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Six. I go red next year.
L352505	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Are you a 5 or a 6? 
L352504	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I didn't say that I would run... I just...
L352503	u1859	m122	LOGAN	But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
L352501	u1859	m122	LOGAN	So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
L352500	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I suppose. But what if you want to live?
L352499	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
L352498	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Why is it wrong to run?
L352497	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm not armed.  Well?
L352496	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I'm afraid to tell you.
L352495	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm listening.
L352494	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Not about that.
L352493	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
L352492	u1858	m122	JESSICA	How a Sandman lives.
L352491	u1859	m122	LOGAN	About what?
L352490	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Curious.
L352489	u1859	m122	LOGAN	And now?
L352488	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I changed my mind.
L352487	u1859	m122	LOGAN	And?
L352486	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I thought I had to do something.
L352485	u1859	m122	LOGAN	But you put yourself on the circuit!
L352484	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No.
L352483	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Later.
L352482	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No.
L352481	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
L352480	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Jessica.
L352479	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You felt sad. What's your name?
L352478	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
L352477	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
L352476	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
L352475	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Killed? Why do you use that word?
L352474	u1858	m122	JESSICA	He was killed.
L352473	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Yes... probably he was renewed?
L352472	u1858	m122	JESSICA	A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
L352471	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Sad? What made you sad?
L352470	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
L352469	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Well then...?
L352468	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No.
L352467	u1859	m122	LOGAN	You prefer women?
L352466	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No.  Just no.
L352465	u1859	m122	LOGAN	"Please... no?  You mean ""not here"" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you."
L352464	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Please... No.
L352463	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What's wrong, Available?
L353090	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Oh, my...
L353089	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Goodbye.
L353056	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Where are you going?
L353055	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Come with us.
L353039	u1858	m122	JESSICA	We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
L353038	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
L353033	u1858	m122	JESSICA	At least it's over...
L353032	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	I'll make the arrangements.
L353031	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
L353030	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What's that?
L353029	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	We'll have to bury him.
L352999	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	I don't know... but it does.
L352998	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What people?
L352997	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	All this. All of it.
L352996	u1858	m122	JESSICA	What belongs to the people?
L352989	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
L352988	u1858	m122	JESSICA	No.
L352987	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
L352986	u1858	m122	JESSICA	I don't know.
L352985	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	What kind of jewel is this?
L352973	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Mother and Father said so... you know?
L352972	u1858	m122	JESSICA	Are you sure?
L352971	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Yes...
L352970	u1858	m122	JESSICA	And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
L352954	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	"Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  ""The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.""  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?"
L352953	u1858	m122	JESSICA	But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
L352952	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
L352720	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
L352719	u1863	m122	RECEPTIONIST	My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
L352718	u1859	m122	LOGAN	It's all right with me. Is he here?
L352717	u1863	m122	RECEPTIONIST	I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
L352716	u1859	m122	LOGAN	A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
L352715	u1863	m122	RECEPTIONIST	We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
L352714	u1863	m122	RECEPTIONIST	Do you want to see Doc?
L352713	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Hello.
L352712	u1863	m122	RECEPTIONIST	Hello, Sandman.
L353088	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Oh my... I'll try.
L353087	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Can you make it back?
L353086	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Yes...
L353085	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm sorry.
L353084	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
L353083	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
L353072	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Oh, yes... I think...
L353071	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Stay? They lived together all their years?
L353070	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	"My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. ""Beloved"" is a word they used -- to stay together."
L353069	u1859	m122	LOGAN	"Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? ""Beloved husband""... ""Beloved son""... ""Beloved wife""..."
L353068	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	That's better than gold when it's cold.
L353066	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
L353065	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
L353061	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	And all alive you say?
L353060	u1859	m122	LOGAN	More... many more.
L353059	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
L353058	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Alive?
L353057	u1859	m122	LOGAN	To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
L353054	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
L353053	u1859	m122	LOGAN	We're leaving.
L353036	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	All right.
L353035	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Not yet.
L353034	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Are you ready to put him in?
L352995	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
L352994	u1859	m122	LOGAN	May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
L352993	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Never, never, ever. Nothing.
L352992	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
L352991	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	No, no, no
L352990	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What's beyond this place -- do you know?
L352982	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
L352981	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	"It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  ""Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."""
L352980	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
L352979	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
L352975	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Dead... they're dead... and buried.
L352974	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Where are they?
L352969	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
L352968	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
L352967	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What makes you think so?
L352966	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	But there may be a few around somewhere.
L352965	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Have any other people ever passed through?
L352964	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Gracious... no.
L352963	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Are there any other humans?
L352962	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	I have always been here...
L352961	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How did you get here?
L352960	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
L352959	u1859	m122	LOGAN	What kind of place is this?
L352958	u1862	m122	OLD MAN	For as long as I can remember.
L352957	u1859	m122	LOGAN	How long have you been living here?
L352810	u1859	m122	LOGAN	No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
L352809	u1864	m122	VOICE	Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
L352808	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
L352807	u1864	m122	VOICE	It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
L352806	u1859	m122	LOGAN	I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
L352402	u1864	m122	VOICE	Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
L352401	u1859	m122	LOGAN	Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
L352400	u1864	m122	VOICE	Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
L352611	u1865	m122	WOMAN	You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
L352610	u1860	m122	MAN	No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
L352421	u1860	m122	MAN	Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
L352420	u1865	m122	WOMAN	Too little.
L352419	u1860	m122	MAN	Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
L352418	u1865	m122	WOMAN	I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
L352417	u1860	m122	MAN	Well? How do you like it?
L381603	u1906	m125	KAY	Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
L381602	u1901	m125	COWAN	And if I say yes?
L381601	u1906	m125	KAY	It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
L381598	u1906	m125	KAY	Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
L381597	u1901	m125	COWAN	Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
L381591	u1901	m125	COWAN	I gotta be honest about something.
L381590	u1906	m125	KAY	No. just peace on Earth.
L381589	u1901	m125	COWAN	And Goodwill Toward Man?
L381588	u1906	m125	KAY	We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
L381576	u1906	m125	KAY	You got smeared.
L381575	u1901	m125	COWAN	I guess I lost:
L381574	u1906	m125	KAY	Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
L381573	u1901	m125	COWAN	What the hell...
L381572	u1906	m125	KAY	...touch that.

L381500	u1911	m125	WALLACE	Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.

L381731	u1906	m125	KAY	Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
L381730	u1904	m125	JAY	I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
L381729	u1906	m125	KAY	She didn't even know you. .
L381728	u1904	m125	JAY	I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
L381694	u1904	m125	JAY	I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
L381693	u1906	m125	KAY	Keep her out of here while I check it out.
L381692	u1904	m125	JAY	I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
L381668	u1906	m125	KAY	This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
L381667	u1904	m125	JAY	I know, but we're on a college campus...
L381666	u1906	m125	KAY	It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
L381665	u1904	m125	JAY	I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
L381660	u1904	m125	JAY	Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
L381659	u1906	m125	KAY	So what's the problem?
L381658	u1904	m125	JAY	So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
L381655	u1904	m125	JAY	But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
L381654	u1906	m125	KAY	Right.
L381653	u1904	m125	JAY	It's a bug.
L381650	u1904	m125	JAY	I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
L381649	u1906	m125	KAY	The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
L381648	u1904	m125	JAY	Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
L381647	u1906	m125	KAY	We wear black.
L381646	u1904	m125	JAY	Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
L382030	u1904	m125	JAY	Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
L382029	u1913	m125	ZED	I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
L382022	u1913	m125	ZED	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
L382021	u1904	m125	JAY	Sure.
L382013	u1904	m125	JAY	You know, there's something we never really thought of...
L382012	u1913	m125	ZED	Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
L381938	u1904	m125	JAY	Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
L381937	u1913	m125	ZED	Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
L381936	u1904	m125	JAY	I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
L382236	u1904	m125	JAY	Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
L382235	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Yeah ... ?
L382234	u1904	m125	JAY	They respond to fear, right?
L382233	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What are you doing?
L382230	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Are you sure you don't?
L382229	u1904	m125	JAY	What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
L382228	u1907	m125	LAUREL	The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
L382227	u1904	m125	JAY	Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
L382189	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Out of focus?
L382188	u1904	m125	JAY	Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
L382157	u1904	m125	JAY	Actually... I don't know.
L382156	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What the hell does that mean?
L382155	u1904	m125	JAY	What do we do?    Lean into it.
L382154	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What do we do?
L382110	u1904	m125	JAY	So... how did they get here?
L382109	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
L382108	u1904	m125	JAY	When?
L382099	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
L382098	u1904	m125	JAY	But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
L382097	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
L382096	u1904	m125	JAY	What is it?
L382095	u1907	m125	LAUREL	I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
L382075	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
L382074	u1904	m125	JAY	Why not?
L382073	u1907	m125	LAUREL	I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
L382072	u1904	m125	JAY	I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
L382071	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
L382068	u1904	m125	JAY	Actually, you may have.
L382067	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
L381710	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Do have any idea what I just said?
L381709	u1904	m125	JAY	Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
L381708	u1907	m125	LAUREL	With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
L381707	u1904	m125	JAY	Right, right-- I like that stuff.
L381698	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
L381697	u1904	m125	JAY	Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
L381696	u1907	m125	LAUREL	So... how'd you hear about this?
L381683	u1904	m125	JAY	I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
L381682	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
L381681	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
L381680	u1904	m125	JAY	So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
L381864	u1905	m125	JEEBS	You're not taking me in!
L381863	u1906	m125	KAY	Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
L381853	u1906	m125	KAY	And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--

L381851	u1906	m125	KAY	And I'm arranging deportation papers.
L381850	u1905	m125	JEEBS	I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
L381849	u1906	m125	KAY	Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
L381847	u1905	m125	JEEBS	I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
L381846	u1906	m125	KAY	You figured what?
L381845	u1905	m125	JEEBS	The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
L381839	u1906	m125	KAY	Maybe you need a closer look.
L381838	u1905	m125	JEEBS	No.
L381837	u1906	m125	KAY	What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
L382195	u1912	m125	YAZ	Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
L382194	u1906	m125	KAY	Goodwill...
L382179	u1912	m125	YAZ	Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
L382178	u1906	m125	KAY	Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
L381997	u1906	m125	KAY	No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
L381996	u1912	m125	YAZ	Come on now.  People are smart.
L381995	u1906	m125	KAY	Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
L381994	u1912	m125	YAZ	How could it not?
L381993	u1906	m125	KAY	Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
L381430	u1906	m125	KAY	What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
L381429	u1909	m125	MIKEY	It's... coming.

L381426	u1906	m125	KAY	Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
L381425	u1909	m125	MIKEY	Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
L381424	u1906	m125	KAY	I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
L381423	u1909	m125	MIKEY	Er. well, nowhere special.
L381422	u1906	m125	KAY	Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
L381421	u1909	m125	MIKEY	Nowhere.
L382130	u1906	m125	KAY	Cause I think we're looking at it.
L382129	u1914	m125	ZED'S VOICE	How'd you know that?  Kay?
L382128	u1906	m125	KAY	Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
L382127	u1914	m125	ZED'S VOICE	Actually, yeah--
L382126	u1906	m125	KAY	Did he say where?

L381821	u1908	m125	LEONARD	I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
L381819	u1908	m125	LEONARD	I promised I wouldn't tell.

L381817	u1908	m125	LEONARD	Found it.
L381812	u1908	m125	LEONARD	I wanna make a deal.
L381811	u1906	m125	KAY	I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
L381810	u1908	m125	LEONARD	Will it lower the curve?
L381809	u1906	m125	KAY	In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
L381808	u1908	m125	LEONARD	What if I don't?
L381807	u1906	m125	KAY	They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
L381806	u1908	m125	LEONARD	They're not my pals--
L381805	u1906	m125	KAY	Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
L382142	u1906	m125	KAY	Wait-- listen--

L382088	u1913	m125	ZED	I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
L382087	u1906	m125	KAY	Yeah?  What's up?
L382049	u1906	m125	KAY	Oh shit!

L382007	u1913	m125	ZED	As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
L381956	u1906	m125	KAY	They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
L381955	u1913	m125	ZED	They went right to the President.

L381932	u1913	m125	ZED	They're gone.

L381887	u1913	m125	ZED	Hard to tell.  I hope not.
L381886	u1906	m125	KAY	Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?

L381884	u1913	m125	ZED	Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
L381883	u1906	m125	KAY	What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
L381882	u1913	m125	ZED	He's gone, too.
L381780	u1906	m125	KAY	What the hell is going on?
L381779	u1913	m125	ZED	I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.

L381992	u1912	m125	YAZ	That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
L381991	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
L381990	u1912	m125	YAZ	A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
L381989	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
L381988	u1912	m125	YAZ	Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
L381987	u1912	m125	YAZ	That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
L381986	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
L381985	u1912	m125	YAZ	Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?

L387153	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Jesus...
L387152	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She's not alive, but she didn't die.
L387151	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's still alive?
L387150	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She grew up.
L387149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She died?
L387148	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
L387147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who wanted her little girl back?
L387146	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
L387066	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I am going back.  I see myself there.
L387065	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha, you're never going back there.
L387064	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
L387063	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
L387062	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The other two will die without me.
L387061	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L387060	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I have to go back.
L387059	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Someplace safe.
L387058	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Where are we going?
L386981	u1915	m126	AGATHA	But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
L386980	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
L386979	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please, I want to go back...
L386977	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You were right.  I'm not being set up.
L386976	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton --
L386975	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
L386973	u1915	m126	AGATHA	What is it?
L386972	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, God...
L386963	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
L386962	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please --
L386961	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  I have to know.
L386959	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton, leave.
L386958	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's here.
L386939	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Wait.
L386938	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386937	u1915	m126	AGATHA	He won't.
L386936	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He'll turn around.
L386935	u1915	m126	AGATHA	No.  Follow him.
L386933	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
L386932	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Forget that guy --
L386931	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Drop some money.
L386927	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386926	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see the balloon man?
L386925	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha --
L386920	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386919	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Take it.
L386914	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who?
L386913	u1915	m126	AGATHA	They're inside.
L386912	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386828	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386827	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386826	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386825	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
L386291	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see?
L386290	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally!
L387155	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
L387154	u1928	m126	LARA	John?  What is it?
L387144	u1928	m126	LARA	I know... I do, too...
L387143	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
L387134	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Anne Lively...
L387133	u1928	m126	LARA	About who?
L387132	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because I found out about her...
L387131	u1928	m126	LARA	Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
L387130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somewhere.
L387129	u1928	m126	LARA	Found?  Where?
L387128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just some guy... they found.
L387127	u1928	m126	LARA	Then who was he?
L387126	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- but he didn't.
L386708	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- go blind.  I know.
L386707	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
L386702	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
L386701	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The nano... what?
L386700	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
L386699	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't even stand up --
L386698	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
L386697	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Here --
L386696	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I find the --
L386695	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
L386644	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
L386643	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
L386638	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
L386637	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set your patients on fire!
L386636	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	They were performance pieces.
L386635	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You made those tapes...
L386634	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Yes, you did.
L386633	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I put you away --
L386631	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
L386630	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	From where?  D.C.?
L386629	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Oh, yes.
L386628	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We know each other?
L386627	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You don't remember me, do you?
L386626	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
L386625	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's all I could safely move.
L386624	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	That's not much.
L386620	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Whatever you say, John.
L386619	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
L386618	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Why?
L386617	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
L386616	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And replace them with new ones.
L386615	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yeah --
L386614	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
L386613	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Right.  I know --
L386612	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
L386611	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's comforting.
L386610	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
L387166	u1923	m126	GIDEON	It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
L387165	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lara --
L387164	u1923	m126	GIDEON	You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
L386348	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
L386347	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
L386346	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
L386345	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, ""glitch?"""
L386344	u1923	m126	GIDEON	No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
L386343	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Try again.
L386342	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
L386339	u1923	m126	GIDEON	On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
L386338	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
L386329	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Not to mention, ""Saved by the bell""."
L386328	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	... Graveyard shift.
L386327	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Hence the expression...
L386321	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
L386320	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the only sentry?
L386319	u1923	m126	GIDEON	For that, we have to go for a ride.
L386318	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
L386317	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
L386316	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
L386315	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's an old one.  One of our first.
L386313	u1923	m126	GIDEON	This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
L386312	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Victim's a white female.
L386310	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Drowning.
L386309	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Kill type?
L386308	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
L386307	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
L386306	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
L386305	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the sentry?
L387313	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
L387312	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No doubt.
L387311	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
L387301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
L387300	u1918	m126	BURGESS	People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
L387254	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
L387253	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John --
L386470	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386469	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can't run --
L386468	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not getting halo'd.
L386467	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Please.  Listen to me --
L386463	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
L386462	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
L386461	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
L386460	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Can you fake the cerebral output?
L386459	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
L386458	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
L386457	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
L386456	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
L386455	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
L386454	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
L386453	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And who the hell is that?
L386452	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somebody named Leo Crow.
L386451	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
L386450	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
L386449	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
L386448	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
L386376	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
L386375	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We won't let them.
L386374	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
L386373	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine, Lamar.
L386372	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
L386371	u1918	m126	BURGESS	In the middle of the night?
L386370	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I go running down there.
L386369	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
L386368	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine.
L386367	u1918	m126	BURGESS	She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
L386366	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386365	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Lara called me.
L386364	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
L386363	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
L386362	u1918	m126	BURGESS	So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
L386361	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
L386354	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
L386353	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
L386219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tuck in your shirt.
L386218	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  What's the other thing?
L386217	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
L386216	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, sir.
L386215	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
L386214	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  Sir.
L386213	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
L386212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Don't apologize, John.
L386211	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
L386210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
L386130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Hang on, Lamar --
L386129	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
L386128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh...
L386127	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
L386126	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The nation votes this week...
L386125	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Don't worry, Lamar.
L386124	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell me not to worry, John.
L386506	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
L386505	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	You don't have to do this, Chief.
L386504	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386503	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
L386092	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show a cop on horseback.
L386091	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
L386090	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
L386089	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"What he's doing now, we call ""scrubbing the image"", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen."
L386081	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
L386080	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Uh, sir...
L386079	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
L386078	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
L386077	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're kidding, that's today?
L386076	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
L386070	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
L386069	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Seventeen minutes.
L386424	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Take your time.
L386423	u1926	m126	JAD	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
L386422	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
L386418	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
L386417	u1926	m126	JAD	Any ID on the shooter yet?
L386416	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Confirm with trig and image.
L386415	u1926	m126	JAD	That was easy.
L386414	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
L386409	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
L386408	u1926	m126	JAD	I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
L386407	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
L386406	u1926	m126	JAD	The victim's name is Leo Crow.
L386400	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
L386399	u1926	m126	JAD	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
L386398	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Red Ball?
L386396	u1926	m126	JAD	We're in motion on something.
L386395	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
L386278	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Go back to work.  All of you.
L386277	u1926	m126	JAD	Sir?
L386276	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh.  Jad?
L386275	u1926	m126	JAD	Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
L386274	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
L386149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did Marks close the front door?!
L386148	u1926	m126	JAD	What?
L386147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did he close the front door?
L386146	u1926	m126	JAD	Go ahead.
L386133	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Now look at him...
L386132	u1926	m126	JAD	Yeah?  So?
L386131	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
L386096	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Georgetown.
L386095	u1926	m126	JAD	The mall?
L386094	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No maglev system.
L386093	u1926	m126	JAD	Somewhere near the capital?
L386068	u1926	m126	JAD	From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
L386067	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
L386066	u1926	m126	JAD	Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
L386057	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Run the subscription list...
L386056	u1926	m126	JAD	We can't grab it...
L386041	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
L386040	u1926	m126	JAD	We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
L386039	u1926	m126	JAD	Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
L386038	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Okay, Jad, what's coming?
L386445	u1934	m126	WITWER	Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
L386444	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You gonna tell on me?
L386443	u1934	m126	WITWER	It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
L386442	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
L386441	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set me up...
L386288	u1934	m126	WITWER	I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
L386287	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
L386286	u1934	m126	WITWER	Flaws.
L386285	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
L386284	u1934	m126	WITWER	At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
L386281	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
L386280	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What does he think of your chosen line of work?
L386279	u1934	m126	WITWER	Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
L386273	u1934	m126	WITWER	The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
L386272	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just a nickname.
L386271	u1934	m126	WITWER	"But you call this room the ""temple""."
L386270	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
L386269	u1934	m126	WITWER	I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
L386251	u1934	m126	WITWER	I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
L386250	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There's no question.  You don't have any.
L386249	u1934	m126	WITWER	If it's a question of authority.
L386248	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Maybe you didn't hear me.
L386247	u1934	m126	WITWER	So I'll be the first one to go in then?
L386246	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
L386245	u1934	m126	WITWER	Really?  You've never been inside?
L386244	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
L386243	u1934	m126	WITWER	To them.
L386242	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	To Hineman?
L386241	u1934	m126	WITWER	Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
L386240	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
L386237	u1934	m126	WITWER	Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
L386236	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
L386235	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
L386234	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
L386233	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
L386232	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.
L386231	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're certain?
L386230	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because it was going to fall.
L386229	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why did you catch that?
L386227	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, it is.
L386226	u1934	m126	WITWER	But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
L386140	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mind if I tag along?
L386139	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
L386138	u1934	m126	WITWER	As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
L386087	u1934	m126	WITWER	Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
L386086	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
L386792	u1933	m126	WALLY	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
L386791	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just go to the beginning!
L386784	u1933	m126	WALLY	There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
L386783	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are these all of her previsions?
L386777	u1933	m126	WALLY	Oh... Hi, John.
L386776	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
L386775	u1933	m126	WALLY	Do I know you?  Who are you?
L386774	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally, listen to me...
L386301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She said...
L386300	u1933	m126	WALLY	To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
L386299	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She spoke to me.
L386298	u1933	m126	WALLY	It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
L386297	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She was looking right at me.
L386296	u1933	m126	WALLY	She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
L386295	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
L386294	u1933	m126	WALLY	Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
L386266	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It helps if you don't think of them as human.
L386265	u1933	m126	WALLY	They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
L386257	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
L386256	u1933	m126	WALLY	I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
L386911	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, I'll try...
L386910	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, play it back...
L386903	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I guess that's all of it.
L386902	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What happened?  Where's the rest?
L386898	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Tell me how.
L386897	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Stop --
L386891	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Then take her to Radio Shack.
L386890	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They don't belong to anybody.
L386889	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
L386888	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So now I need you to hack into her.
L386887	u1929	m126	RUFUS	So?
L386886	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
L386885	u1929	m126	RUFUS	No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
L386884	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
L386883	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
L386882	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
L386881	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Are you reading my mind right now?
L386879	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's right.
L386878	u1929	m126	RUFUS	She's a precog?
L386877	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus.  She's a precog.
L386876	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
L386875	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hello there, honey-pie.
L386874	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need help with her.
L386873	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
L386872	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need your help.
L386871	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
L387192	u1931	m126	SEAN	Hold your breath, Dad...
L387191	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean, wait...
L387190	u1931	m126	SEAN	I'm your son.  I'm you.
L387189	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who are you?
L387188	u1931	m126	SEAN	Good-bye, Dad...
L387187	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I wanted to.
L387186	u1931	m126	SEAN	I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
L387185	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I was looking for you...
L387184	u1931	m126	SEAN	The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
L387183	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you...
L387182	u1931	m126	SEAN	Once I even told him I loved him.
L387181	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you.
L387180	u1931	m126	SEAN	I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
L387179	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean --
L387178	u1931	m126	SEAN	The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
L387177	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Sean --
L387176	u1931	m126	SEAN	No.  He got tired of pretending.
L387175	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're alive?
L387174	u1931	m126	SEAN	I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
L387173	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the hell.
L387172	u1931	m126	SEAN	Wanna hear something funny?
L387171	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's a little late for that.
L387170	u1931	m126	SEAN	You gotta have faith, Dad.
L387169	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean -- you're not real.
L386718	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All right, I'll try...
L386717	u1931	m126	SEAN	Come on!
L386716	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
L386715	u1931	m126	SEAN	Okay... now let me time you.
L386200	u1931	m126	SEAN	I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
L386199	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
L386196	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What a big boy.  How old are you?
L386195	u1931	m126	SEAN	I won!
L386193	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's great.
L386192	u1931	m126	SEAN	I scored a goal!
L387028	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Good-bye, Crow.
L387027	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me...
L387026	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Let go of the gun.
L387025	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me!
L387024	u1919	m126	CROW	Kill me!
L387023	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who made you do this?
L387022	u1919	m126	CROW	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
L387021	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me, who was it, set this up?
L387020	u1919	m126	CROW	Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
L387019	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What about the picture --
L387016	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the fuck is going on?
L387015	u1919	m126	CROW	I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
L387014	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
L387013	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
L387012	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
L387011	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
L387007	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who said I would?
L387006	u1919	m126	CROW	You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
L387005	u1919	m126	CROW	If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
L387004	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs were wrong.
L387003	u1919	m126	CROW	But you have to.  They said you would.
L387002	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No.
L387001	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me?
L386996	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	NO!
L386995	u1919	m126	CROW	It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
L386994	u1919	m126	CROW	I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
L386993	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
L386992	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's alive?
L386991	u1919	m126	CROW	... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
L386989	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
L386988	u1919	m126	CROW	Some -- somebody's father?
L386987	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Do you know who I am?
L386985	u1919	m126	CROW	Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
L386984	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
L386593	u1925	m126	IRIS	The female.
L386592	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Which one is that?
L386591	u1925	m126	IRIS	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
L386590	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I even know which one has it?
L386585	u1925	m126	IRIS	Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
L386584	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
L386583	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're insane or you think I am.
L386582	u1925	m126	IRIS	Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
L386581	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- and then walk out.
L386580	u1925	m126	IRIS	If... you have one.
L386579	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
L386578	u1925	m126	IRIS	Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
L386577	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where?
L386576	u1925	m126	IRIS	The safest place of all.
L386575	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What safe place is that?
L386574	u1925	m126	IRIS	I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
L386573	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You said they're destroyed.
L386572	u1925	m126	IRIS	You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
L386571	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why should I trust you?
L386570	u1925	m126	IRIS	Hold that thought.
L386569	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
L386568	u1925	m126	IRIS	But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
L386567	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to bring it down.
L386566	u1925	m126	IRIS	Do you?  Really?
L386565	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I believe in that system...
L386564	u1925	m126	IRIS	The system would collapse.
L386563	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
L386562	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
L386561	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
L386560	u1925	m126	IRIS	I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
L386559	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
L386558	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
L386557	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
L386556	u1925	m126	IRIS	Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
L386555	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L386554	u1925	m126	IRIS	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
L386553	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
L386552	u1925	m126	IRIS	Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
L386551	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386549	u1925	m126	IRIS	I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
L386548	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So you won't help me?
L386547	u1925	m126	IRIS	How can you avoid a man you've never met?
L386546	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Not if I stay away from him.
L386545	u1925	m126	IRIS	And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
L386544	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
L386543	u1925	m126	IRIS	So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
L386542	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You say some of the children died?
L386541	u1925	m126	IRIS	Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
L386540	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	And how did Lamar become involved?
L386539	u1925	m126	IRIS	It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
L386537	u1925	m126	IRIS	You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
L386536	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're talking about the precogs...
L386535	u1925	m126	IRIS	The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
L386534	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Heal who?
L386533	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
L386532	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't seem all that proud.
L386531	u1925	m126	IRIS	If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
L386530	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What's so funny?
L386528	u1925	m126	IRIS	And how would I know that?
L386527	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
L386526	u1925	m126	IRIS	Just what is it you think I can do for you?
L386522	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm... not... a... killer.
L386521	u1925	m126	IRIS	You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
L386516	u1925	m126	IRIS	The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
L386515	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The what?
L386514	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
L386513	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm a little dizzy...
L386512	u1925	m126	IRIS	Something wrong?
L387054	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
L387053	u1928	m126	LARA	Then how did he --
L387052	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
L387051	u1928	m126	LARA	Oh, God, what did you do?
L387050	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	He's dead, Lara.
L387049	u1928	m126	LARA	John?
L387225	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
L387224	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
L387223	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar --
L387222	u1918	m126	BURGESS	But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
L387220	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
L387219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I understand.
L387217	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
L387216	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Sean --
L387215	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
L387213	u1928	m126	LARA	He also said Crow was a fake.
L387212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We know why John was tagged.
L387211	u1928	m126	LARA	"John said something about him being set up because he ""found out about her."""
L387210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't know who that is.
L387209	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
L387208	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Who?
L387205	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
L387204	u1928	m126	LARA	I thought you were retiring?
L387203	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's insanity around here.
L387197	u1928	m126	LARA	You look great.
L387196	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
L387194	u1928	m126	LARA	No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
L387193	u1918	m126	BURGESS	This is all my fault.
L387251	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
L387250	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	You have an emergency call on your private line.
L387243	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	I padded your expense account for the last six months.
L387242	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How did you get this?
L387241	u1918	m126	BURGESS	My God...
L387240	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Congratulations, sir.
L387227	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I'll be right there.
L387226	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Sir, the press conference is starting.
L387202	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Not.  Now.
L387201	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	He just wanted a few minutes before --
L387200	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell him not now.
L387199	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	The guy from USA Today is here.
L387104	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
L387103	u1934	m126	WITWER	What?
L387102	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Shhh.  You know what I hear?
L387101	u1934	m126	WITWER	Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
L387100	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes.
L387099	u1934	m126	WITWER	So there is a way to fool the system?
L387098	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
L387097	u1934	m126	WITWER	Precog Deja Vu...
L387096	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
L387095	u1934	m126	WITWER	By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
L387094	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How?
L387093	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
L387092	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
L387091	u1934	m126	WITWER	I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
L387090	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
L387089	u1934	m126	WITWER	According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
L387088	u1934	m126	WITWER	This murder is happening at two different times.
L387087	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't understand --
L387086	u1934	m126	WITWER	Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
L387084	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not quite.
L387083	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's the same prevision.
L387082	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
L387081	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
L387075	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wait, just a second...
L387074	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Good God.  What was that?
L387073	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Where are you?
L387072	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
L387071	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What?
L387070	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar, I found something.
L386484	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't want John Anderton hurt.
L386483	u1934	m126	WITWER	Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
L386482	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's my subordinate!
L386481	u1934	m126	WITWER	Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
L386480	u1918	m126	BURGESS	None of your damn business.
L386479	u1934	m126	WITWER	Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
L386478	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
L386477	u1934	m126	WITWER	Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
L386476	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
L386475	u1934	m126	WITWER	He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
L386870	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
L386869	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	No, I wanna kill my boss!
L386868	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
L386866	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
L386865	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	Right here.
L386864	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
L386863	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	I wanna kill my boss.
L386862	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
L387047	u1934	m126	WITWER	None.  This was arranged.
L387046	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	How many?
L387045	u1934	m126	WITWER	"I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an ""orgy of evidence"".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?"
L387044	u1934	m126	WITWER	Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
L387043	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
L387042	u1934	m126	WITWER	What kind of cop were you before this?
L387041	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
L387040	u1934	m126	WITWER	If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
L387039	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I don't know, why?
L387038	u1934	m126	WITWER	There a maid in this hotel?
L386858	u1934	m126	WITWER	No.  He can't...
L386857	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
L386856	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's trying to prove his innocence.
L386820	u1934	m126	WITWER	She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
L386819	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	We can stop him.
L386818	u1934	m126	WITWER	It doesn't matter.  He wins.
L386768	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Two?
L386767	u1934	m126	WITWER	There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
L386604	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because he thinks he's innocent.
L386603	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
L386602	u1934	m126	WITWER	Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
L386600	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They're everywhere.
L386599	u1934	m126	WITWER	There's thousands of units like this one.
L386598	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
L386496	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes, I know.
L386495	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
L386473	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	What?!
L386472	u1934	m126	WITWER	Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
L386471	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
L386239	u1934	m126	WITWER	Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
L386238	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"Because of the nature of murder.  ""There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another""."
L386221	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
L386220	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
L386110	u1934	m126	WITWER	People have gotten the message.  Gum?
L386109	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
L386108	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	That's the Red Ball Alarm.
L386107	u1934	m126	WITWER	Can't they shut that off?
L386103	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
L386102	u1934	m126	WITWER	So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
L386098	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you.  Gum?
L386097	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	This is Evanna, the team pilot.
L387238	u1927	m126	KNOTT	"You ""friend's"" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder..."
L387237	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	John Anderton was my friend!
L387236	u1927	m126	KNOTT	Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
L387235	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Why don't I feel like celebrating?
L386741	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Knott!
L386740	u1927	m126	KNOTT	People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
L386729	u1927	m126	KNOTT	It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
L386728	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I think you're swell company, Knott.
L386727	u1927	m126	KNOTT	That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
L386154	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I forgot my glasses.
L386153	u1930	m126	SARAH	Howard --
L386120	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Sure.  Raincheck.
L386119	u1930	m126	SARAH	Raincheck?
L386118	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
L386117	u1930	m126	SARAH	I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
L386116	u1924	m126	HOWARD	We could have lunch together.
L386114	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
L386113	u1930	m126	SARAH	What about your meeting?
L386065	u1930	m126	SARAH	How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
L386064	u1924	m126	HOWARD	The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
L386063	u1930	m126	SARAH	Who?
L386062	u1924	m126	HOWARD	He looks familiar.
L386692	u1934	m126	WITWER	But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
L386691	u1928	m126	LARA	I haven't seen him in two years.
L386690	u1934	m126	WITWER	To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
L386689	u1928	m126	LARA	To what?  Trap him?
L386688	u1934	m126	WITWER	You know I need to use you.
L386687	u1928	m126	LARA	I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
L386686	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
L386685	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
L386684	u1928	m126	LARA	He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
L386683	u1934	m126	WITWER	He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
L386682	u1928	m126	LARA	The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
L386681	u1934	m126	WITWER	What was it then?
L386680	u1928	m126	LARA	It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
L386679	u1934	m126	WITWER	You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
L386678	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386677	u1934	m126	WITWER	But John was with him at the pool?
L386676	u1928	m126	LARA	It was nobody's fault.
L386675	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mean after he lost your son.
L386674	u1928	m126	LARA	Since right after we lost our son.
L386671	u1934	m126	WITWER	Have you been there recently?
L386670	u1928	m126	LARA	That was our apartment.
L386669	u1934	m126	WITWER	So you haven't seen his apartment?
L386668	u1928	m126	LARA	No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
L386667	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
L386666	u1928	m126	LARA	No.
L386665	u1934	m126	WITWER	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
L386664	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any sugar either.
L386662	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's not here now, is he?
L386661	u1928	m126	LARA	We used to, every summer.
L386660	u1934	m126	WITWER	Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
L386659	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
L386658	u1934	m126	WITWER	Cream and sugar.
L386657	u1928	m126	LARA	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
L386656	u1934	m126	WITWER	I like it.
L386655	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386654	u1934	m126	WITWER	This your work?
L386653	u1928	m126	LARA	I know who you are.
L386652	u1934	m126	WITWER	My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
L386815	u1934	m126	WITWER	Jesus...
L386814	u1933	m126	WALLY	Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
L386813	u1934	m126	WITWER	Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
L386812	u1933	m126	WALLY	You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
L386811	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wally, the other two can still function, right?
L386810	u1934	m126	WITWER	But there's still the other two.
L386809	u1933	m126	WALLY	What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
L386808	u1934	m126	WITWER	What does he want with a precog?
L386807	u1933	m126	WALLY	They've never been separated before.
L386260	u1934	m126	WITWER	Tell me how all this works.
L386259	u1933	m126	WALLY	Shhh!  They're sleeping.
L386258	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you, Wally.
L379536	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
L379535	u2073	m134	HALDEN	You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
L379534	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	True.
L379533	u2073	m134	HALDEN	System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
L379530	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
L379529	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes, I believe he has --
L379528	u2073	m134	HALDEN	God-Damn you!
L379526	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
L379525	u2073	m134	HALDEN	They have nothing to do with this --
L379524	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379523	u2073	m134	HALDEN	There are two million people in there with you.
L379522	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	I need to take back what's mine.
L379521	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What do you need?
L379520	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
L379519	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What do you want?
L379518	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
L379517	u2073	m134	HALDEN	This is Halden.
L379663	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
L379662	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Why --
L379661	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Because I took it out of your memory.
L379660	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	How come I can't remember?
L379659	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
L379658	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	She said I have a son...
L379656	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	To live forever.
L379655	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Why?
L379653	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's all been transferred.
L379652	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Okay...
L379651	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's okay.
L379649	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	From the dream.
L379648	u2072	m134	GENA	Wake up?!
L379647	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's time to wake up.
L379645	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Nothing, go back to sleep.
L379644	u2072	m134	GENA	What's happening?
L379638	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
L379637	u2072	m134	GENA	But this is impossible.
L379635	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Just like you always wanted.
L379634	u2072	m134	GENA	Guests?
L379633	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	The guests are here.
L379631	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379630	u2072	m134	GENA	It's all here...
L379452	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	No...
L379451	u2072	m134	GENA	You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
L379429	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Someone who believes in miracles.
L379428	u2072	m134	GENA	Who are you?!
L379424	u2072	m134	GENA	About what?
L379423	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	You were right.
L379421	u2072	m134	GENA	I'm serious, how did you know my name?
L379420	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Do you believe in miracles?
L379418	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
L379417	u2072	m134	GENA	No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
L379416	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Your life that bad?
L379414	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- No.
L379413	u2072	m134	GENA	This is how you pick up women --
L379412	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
L379411	u2072	m134	GENA	That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
L379410	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
L379409	u2072	m134	GENA	As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
L379861	u2078	m134	TANNER	And down here --
L379860	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Only up there in the dream they called life.
L379859	u2078	m134	TANNER	But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
L379858	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	One would assume so.
L379857	u2078	m134	TANNER	Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
L379855	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379854	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Two million people plugged-in here.
L379853	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
L379850	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
L379849	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
L379848	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
L379734	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
L379733	u2078	m134	TANNER	Dream?!
L379732	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
L379731	u2078	m134	TANNER	You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
L379730	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes...
L379729	u2078	m134	TANNER	You were the one who was dying.
L379718	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Not real?
L379717	u2078	m134	TANNER	It's not real.
L379716	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	The new world.
L379715	u2078	m134	TANNER	In a computer program.
L379714	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
L379713	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	In here I am.
L379712	u2078	m134	TANNER	You are not a God.
L379711	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379710	u2078	m134	TANNER	Divinity?
L379708	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	So wrong --
L379707	u2078	m134	TANNER	Not my problem.
L379706	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
L379704	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Then what?
L379703	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379702	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
L379701	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	True.  But why?
L379700	u2078	m134	TANNER	The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
L379557	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- He will.
L379556	u2069	m134	DEX	But what if he doesn't --
L379555	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's his nature.
L379554	u2069	m134	DEX	You sure he's going to come?
L379553	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
L379552	u2069	m134	DEX	And what about the reconfiguration?
L379551	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Unfinished business.
L379550	u2069	m134	DEX	Where the hell are you going?
L379549	u2069	m134	DEX	Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
L379548	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
L379543	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
L379542	u2071	m134	EMMA	The maze has been changed --
L379540	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
L379539	u2071	m134	EMMA	What about the customers with reservations?
L379538	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
L379504	u2071	m134	EMMA	At least a day.
L379503	u2073	m134	HALDEN	How long?
L379502	u2071	m134	EMMA	We're going to have to reconfigure.
L379501	u2073	m134	HALDEN	How long 'till we can eject?
L379402	u2072	m134	GENA	Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
L379401	u2078	m134	TANNER	Take care.
L379395	u2078	m134	TANNER	There is no --
L379394	u2072	m134	GENA	The woman you're stuck on.
L379393	u2078	m134	TANNER	Who?
L379392	u2072	m134	GENA	What's her name?
L379390	u2072	m134	GENA	The weather.
L379389	u2078	m134	TANNER	What?
L379387	u2072	m134	GENA	I'm South Dakota.
L379386	u2078	m134	TANNER	New York.
L379385	u2072	m134	GENA	Where you plugged-in from?
L379778	u2078	m134	TANNER	If she's alive, you get it back.
L379777	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Insurance?
L379776	u2078	m134	TANNER	Insurance.
L379775	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Need the disk back!
L379773	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Times Square.
L379772	u2078	m134	TANNER	Where?
L379771	u2073	m134	HALDEN	An interface attendant.
L379768	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Come on Tanner, think this through.
L379767	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then where is she?
L379766	u2073	m134	HALDEN	There was no need to kill her.
L379765	u2078	m134	TANNER	Try harder.
L379764	u2073	m134	HALDEN	We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
L379763	u2078	m134	TANNER	To hide the evidence.
L379762	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Why would I do that?
L379761	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then you had her killed.
L379760	u2078	m134	TANNER	Katie was digitized.
L379759	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Not his style.
L379758	u2078	m134	TANNER	The truth.
L379757	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What did he tell you?
L379617	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Who did he digitize?!
L379616	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
L379615	u2078	m134	TANNER	Who did he digitize?
L379614	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
L379613	u2078	m134	TANNER	Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
L379610	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Good question.
L379609	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
L379608	u2073	m134	HALDEN	That's right.
L379607	u2078	m134	TANNER	Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
L379606	u2073	m134	HALDEN	He wouldn't say.
L379605	u2078	m134	TANNER	Why?
L379604	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
L379603	u2073	m134	HALDEN	It's not used for anything.
L379602	u2078	m134	TANNER	A hotel?
L379601	u2073	m134	HALDEN	The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
L379600	u2078	m134	TANNER	What is it?
L379595	u2078	m134	TANNER	The truth.
L379594	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What?
L379593	u2078	m134	TANNER	One condition.
L379589	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Christoph changed the maze.
L379588	u2078	m134	TANNER	You've got the keys, send someone in --
L379587	u2073	m134	HALDEN	The only way to eject it is from the inside.
L379584	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
L379583	u2078	m134	TANNER	Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
L379582	u2078	m134	TANNER	And you weren't involved.
L379581	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
L379580	u2078	m134	TANNER	Corporate fingerprints all over it.
L379579	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- I saw the program.
L379578	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
L379577	u2078	m134	TANNER	Try harder.
L379574	u2078	m134	TANNER	He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
L379573	u2073	m134	HALDEN	You're jumping to conclusions.
L379509	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Go!
L379508	u2078	m134	TANNER	We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
L379494	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Yes.
L379493	u2078	m134	TANNER	He had access to the keys --
L379486	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- He won't.
L379485	u2078	m134	TANNER	Won't be time if he gets access --
L379472	u2078	m134	TANNER	Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
L379471	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Two maze runners.
L379433	u2078	m134	TANNER	Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
L379432	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
L379336	u2078	m134	TANNER	But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
L379335	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
L379331	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
L379330	u2078	m134	TANNER	He had keys.
L379838	u2074	m134	KATIE	There was no other choice.
L379837	u2078	m134	TANNER	Sorry?!
L379836	u2074	m134	KATIE	I'm sorry.
L379832	u2074	m134	KATIE	What's the difference?
L379831	u2078	m134	TANNER	Not you.  A copy.
L379830	u2074	m134	KATIE	But you were with me.
L379829	u2078	m134	TANNER	I know.
L379828	u2074	m134	KATIE	I wasn't with you.
L379826	u2074	m134	KATIE	Way you kiss me.
L379825	u2078	m134	TANNER	What?
L379821	u2078	m134	TANNER	Yes.
L379820	u2074	m134	KATIE	And it meant something.
L379816	u2078	m134	TANNER	You weren't real.
L379815	u2074	m134	KATIE	Realize?
L379814	u2078	m134	TANNER	To see how long it would take for me to realize.
L379813	u2074	m134	KATIE	For what?
L379812	u2078	m134	TANNER	It was a test.
L379811	u2074	m134	KATIE	Why?
L379810	u2078	m134	TANNER	Once they digitized you, they added it.
L379809	u2074	m134	KATIE	But I don't know anything about programming.
L379808	u2078	m134	TANNER	Yes.
L379807	u2074	m134	KATIE	You said we were on the same programming team.
L379805	u2074	m134	KATIE	Her?
L379804	u2078	m134	TANNER	That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
L379803	u2078	m134	TANNER	Corporation can.
L379802	u2074	m134	KATIE	That's not possible.  No one can do that.
L379801	u2078	m134	TANNER	Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
L379794	u2078	m134	TANNER	Night City.
L379793	u2074	m134	KATIE	-- The inside?
L379792	u2078	m134	TANNER	We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
L379791	u2074	m134	KATIE	Who are you?!
L379790	u2078	m134	TANNER	Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
L379788	u2074	m134	KATIE	What are you talking about?
L379787	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- You told me.
L379786	u2074	m134	KATIE	Then how do you know about --
L379785	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379784	u2074	m134	KATIE	You went to my high-school?
L379781	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Katie.
L379780	u2074	m134	KATIE	I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
L379743	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379742	u2074	m134	KATIE	Someone you have to get back to?
L379380	u2074	m134	KATIE	Tanner.
L379379	u2078	m134	TANNER	I've got to get back.
L379378	u2074	m134	KATIE	Some things never change, do they?
L379377	u2078	m134	TANNER	Cleaning up a mess.
L379376	u2074	m134	KATIE	What brings you inside?
L379463	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
L379462	u2075	m134	KID	Don't know what you're talking about.
L379448	u2075	m134	KID	Just like that --
L379447	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Just like that?
L379446	u2075	m134	KID	My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
L379445	u2076	m134	LAWYER	There?
L379444	u2075	m134	KID	It was just there.
L379443	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Try me.
L379442	u2075	m134	KID	Because you'll never believe me.
L379441	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Why not?
L379440	u2075	m134	KID	This.  No point to it.
L379439	u2076	m134	LAWYER	What's so funny?
L379438	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
L379437	u2075	m134	KID	Don't know what you're talking about.
L379436	u2076	m134	LAWYER	You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
L379435	u2075	m134	KID	Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
L379434	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

L503324	u2701	m176	JANINE	Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
L503211	u2696	m176	BETTS	Was he nice to you?
L503210	u2701	m176	JANINE	No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
L503209	u2696	m176	BETTS	Hi. Want a drink?
L503208	u2701	m176	JANINE	Hi.
L503158	u2696	m176	BETTS	So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
L503157	u2701	m176	JANINE	He'll be really mad.
L503156	u2696	m176	BETTS	Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
L503155	u2701	m176	JANINE	He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
L503154	u2696	m176	BETTS	...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
L503221	u2697	m176	BOY	Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
L503220	u2700	m176	GIRL	Jesus!
L503218	u2700	m176	GIRL	With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
L503217	u2697	m176	BOY	Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
L503216	u2700	m176	GIRL	OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
L503215	u2697	m176	BOY	I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
L503214	u2700	m176	GIRL	C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
L503115	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	He sounded fine.
L503114	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
L503113	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
L503112	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	I see. Then what brought you up here?
L503111	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
L503110	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
L503109	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
L503108	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	You knew these people?
L503107	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No, nothing.
L503106	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
L503105	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes.
L503104	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	You're the one who found the bodies?
L503103	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Sure.
L503102	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L503101	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
L503100	u2706	m176	SUPER	Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
L503099	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Medical clinic?
L503098	u2706	m176	SUPER	Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
L503097	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	Is that the man who called you up here?
L503096	u2706	m176	SUPER	Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
L503095	u2698	m176	DETECTIVE	And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
L503302	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Down to the incinerator.
L503301	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	But where are you going?
L503287	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
L503286	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
L503285	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
L503284	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Where is he now? Do you know?
L503283	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
L503282	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
L503272	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
L503271	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. But late.
L503270	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Well? Supper at my place?
L503269	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No. I don't think so.
L503268	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Anything wrong?
L503267	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
L503266	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
L503265	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
L503239	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	No. Dotty's the last.
L503238	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
L503237	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Another kiss?
L503236	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Uh, OK. Sure.
L503235	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Kiss, kiss?
L503234	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Do I get a kiss?
L503233	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
L503232	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
L503181	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
L503180	u2699	m176	FORSYTHE	Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
L503315	u2701	m176	JANINE	I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
L503314	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
L503310	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
L503309	u2701	m176	JANINE	Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
L503308	u2707	m176	TUDOR	You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
L503307	u2701	m176	JANINE	Nick, you're so strange...
L503306	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
L503152	u2707	m176	TUDOR	Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
L503151	u2701	m176	JANINE	You say something?
L503089	u2707	m176	TUDOR	I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
L503088	u2701	m176	JANINE	I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
L503087	u2707	m176	TUDOR	What do you want to call me at the office for?
L503086	u2701	m176	JANINE	Can I call you at the office?
L503333	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
L503332	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
L503331	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Yes? Who is there?
L503300	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
L503299	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	We live in 703.
L503298	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
L503296	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
L503295	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
L503293	u2702	m176	MR. SPERGAZZI	Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
L503292	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	What happened?
L503207	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
L503206	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
L503205	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Gonna cut me open?
L503204	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
L503202	u2703	m176	PARKINS	That's the one.
L503201	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
L503200	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
L503199	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
L503198	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Didn't seem worried about them.
L503197	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
L503196	u2703	m176	PARKINS	She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
L503195	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
L503194	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Good shape for an old man, eh?
L503193	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Just breathe normally.
L503192	u2703	m176	PARKINS	Want me to breathe deeply?
L503264	u2704	m176	ROLLO	OK, Rog. See you at ten.
L503263	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
L503262	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
L503261	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yeah? What do I do then?
L503260	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
L503259	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
L503258	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
L503257	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
L503256	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Huh?
L503255	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	He didn't make it.
L503252	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Lemme clarify for you.
L503251	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I don't get it.
L503250	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
L503249	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK, I bite. What does it look like?
L503248	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
L503247	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	No? How come?
L503246	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
L503244	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
L503243	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
L503242	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes?
L503241	u2704	m176	ROLLO	That you, Rog?
L503240	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Yes?
L503150	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	OK. I'll think about it.
L503149	u2704	m176	ROLLO	But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
L503145	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
L503144	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Who was she?
L503143	u2704	m176	ROLLO	It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
L503142	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
L503141	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
L503140	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
L503139	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
L503133	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
L503132	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	I don't get it.
L503131	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
L503130	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	It's crazy.
L503129	u2704	m176	ROLLO	You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
L503128	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
L503127	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Did I say anything?
L503126	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
L503123	u2704	m176	ROLLO	That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
L503122	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
L503121	u2704	m176	ROLLO	So who changes?
L503120	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	Well, at least you still talk the same.
L503119	u2704	m176	ROLLO	I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
L503118	u2705	m176	ST. LUC	You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
L503117	u2704	m176	ROLLO	Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
L505798	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't touch him.
L505797	u2743	m179	BO	Daddy.
L505360	u2743	m179	BO	No dad!
L505359	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
L505241	u2743	m179	BO	Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
L505240	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This one?
L505239	u2743	m179	BO	A hair.
L505238	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This one?
L505237	u2743	m179	BO	There's dust in it.
L505175	u2743	m179	BO	She doesn't answer me either.
L505174	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505173	u2743	m179	BO	Does she ever answer back?
L505172	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It makes me feel better.
L505171	u2743	m179	BO	Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
L505170	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What are you thinking about?
L505169	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Right.
L505168	u2743	m179	BO	Only for pee or poop.
L505167	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
L505166	u2743	m179	BO	It tastes old.
L505165	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
L505164	u2743	m179	BO	I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
L505163	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's the matter?
L505160	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
L505159	u2743	m179	BO	Houdini's sick.
L505581	u2743	m179	BO	Me too.
L505580	u2748	m179	MORGAN	I'm scared.
L505478	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Who said I was going to die?
L505477	u2743	m179	BO	I don't want you to die.
L505462	u2748	m179	MORGAN	That's weird.
L505461	u2743	m179	BO	The same windows.
L505404	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dad!
L505403	u2743	m179	BO	My ballet recital.
L505402	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
L505350	u2743	m179	BO	I heard them Morgan.
L505349	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
L505126	u2748	m179	MORGAN	He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
L505125	u2743	m179	BO	It tastes funny.
L505124	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
L505123	u2748	m179	MORGAN	You don't even know what that word means.
L505122	u2743	m179	BO	I think it's contaminated.
L505779	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
L505778	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	And tell Merrill to swing away.
L505777	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
L505776	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm here.
L505775	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Graham --
L505774	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	...I will.
L505773	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
L505772	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	...I will.
L505771	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
L505770	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Good.
L505769	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	I don't feel much.
L505768	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Does it hurt?
L505766	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You love walks.
L505765	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	I was just taking a walk before dinner.
L505764	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Hi baby.
L505763	u2744	m179	COLLEEN	Hi sweetie.
L505307	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
L505306	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Five. The five longest.
L505305	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	You got two minor league home run records don't you?
L505304	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I got the bat at home... On the wall.
L505299	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Clear for what?
L505298	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
L505297	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I see.
L505296	u2745	m179	CREWCUT GUY	I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
L505295	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You do?
L505800	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't.
L505799	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Graham.
L505796	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Graham.
L505795	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't touch him.
L505731	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Me too.
L505730	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's good enough for me.
L505728	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
L505727	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
L505726	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
L505725	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Have they said anything about our area?
L505724	u2747	m179	MERRILL	He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
L505722	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
L505721	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505719	u2747	m179	MERRILL	A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
L505718	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	How do they know it's over?
L505717	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
L505716	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	How many died?
L505714	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
L505713	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're broadcasting...
L505676	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm close.
L505675	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's getting stronger.
L505674	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Me too.
L505673	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I can feel air.
L505664	u2747	m179	MERRILL	From what?
L505663	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're distracting us?
L505646	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Got it!
L505645	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Merrill!
L505643	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm looking!
L505642	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Merrill --
L505633	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
L505632	u2747	m179	MERRILL	We won't be able to get out of there.
L505625	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	"He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, ""No."" He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it."
L505624	u2747	m179	MERRILL	What are you doing?
L505623	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He was only a year and half old.
L505622	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They're right behind the door.
L505621	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Should we make a run for it out the back?
L505620	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
L505618	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We have to go in the basement.
L505617	u2747	m179	MERRILL	This is going to do nothing.
L505608	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
L505607	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They're on the roof.
L505600	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	They already know we're here.
L505599	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Should we turn off the lights?
L505578	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
L505577	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Chicken Teriyaki.
L505532	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
L505531	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I'm sorry, what book is this?
L505469	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Ray Reddy's house.
L505468	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Where are you going?
L505438	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
L505437	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
L505436	u2747	m179	MERRILL	They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
L505433	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Eleven a.m. They're gone.
L505432	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What time is it?
L505431	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
L505430	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's furry, furry rabbit?
L505429	u2747	m179	MERRILL	For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
L505423	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What does it matter then?
L505422	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Yes.
L505421	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Do you feel comforted?
L505415	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
L505414	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
L505413	u2747	m179	MERRILL	How can you say that?
L505412	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes.
L505411	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Do you think it's a possibility?
L505367	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I got him.
L505366	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Morgan, be careful.
L505352	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That's right.
L505351	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
L505339	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
L505338	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It's noise.
L505326	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
L505325	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Pharmacy crowded?
L505230	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
L505229	u2747	m179	MERRILL	That roof is over ten feet high.
L505228	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
L505227	u2747	m179	MERRILL	This guy got on the roof in like a second.
L505211	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes, it was.
L505210	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It was very dark.
L505201	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes it was.
L505200	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It was very dark.
L505198	u2747	m179	MERRILL	I heard.
L505197	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I cursed.
L505190	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You want him coming in the house next time?
L505189	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No I'm not.
L505188	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Are you going to do this or what?
L505187	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Explain noises.
L505186	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Just make noises then.
L505185	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
L505184	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You don't mean it. It's just for show.
L505183	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm not going to curse.
L505182	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Curse and stuff.
L505181	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Explain, act crazy?
L505179	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
L505178	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
L505803	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
L505802	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Did someone save me?
L505658	u2748	m179	MORGAN	I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
L505657	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I can't even imagine.
L505640	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You're scaring your sister.
L505639	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They'll read our minds!
L505584	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't yell at her!
L505583	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Stop crying!
L505576	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
L505575	u2748	m179	MORGAN	French toast... and mashed potatoes.
L505568	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
L505567	u2748	m179	MORGAN	What about Isabelle?
L505566	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	The family room.
L505565	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Where are we going to sleep?
L505564	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
L505537	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Sounds made up.
L505536	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
L505535	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They win.
L505534	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What's two?
L505533	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
L505530	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
L505529	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
L505455	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I just asked his name.
L505454	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dad.
L505453	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Bimboo?
L505452	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
L505447	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	That means they're unemployed.
L505446	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
L505445	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Who wrote this book?
L505444	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
L505443	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They tell you everything in this book.
L505442	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Oh.
L505441	u2748	m179	MORGAN	So the aliens can't read our minds.
L505365	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
L505364	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Morgan?
L505344	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't do it.
L505343	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I'm getting out now.
L505341	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
L505340	u2748	m179	MORGAN	We might lose the signal.
L505252	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's old Morgan.
L505251	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It's still making the noises. It's broken.
L505225	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I have some upstairs.
L505224	u2748	m179	MORGAN	These are D's; I need double A's.
L505220	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Edgar, come inside.
L505219	u2748	m179	MORGAN	It needs batteries.
L505218	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Yes.
L505217	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
L505759	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What did you say?
L505758	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
L505757	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Pinned? What does that mean?
L505756	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
L505755	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Why not?
L505754	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	She's not in an ambulance Father.
L505752	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
L505751	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Is he okay?
L505750	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
L505749	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
L505273	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	You take care of yourself...  Graham.
L505272	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
L505271	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
L505270	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	And three weeks.
L505269	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Six months.
L505268	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
L505250	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505249	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Is anything missing?
L505247	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	No.
L505246	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
L505245	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I don't think so.
L505215	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
L505214	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
L505207	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	I would say so.
L505206	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Okay.  So he was tall?
L505205	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	He definitely wasn't a midget.
L505204	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
L505203	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
L505202	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
L505151	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
L505150	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Sounds like a virus.
L505149	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
L505148	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What was the first thing?
L505147	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Second thing this week I can't explain.
L505144	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
L505143	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	It's not broken.
L505141	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	There are none.
L505140	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	What about them?
L505139	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	The footprints.
L505138	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	You said something was strange. What's strange?
L505137	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	Sorry.
L505136	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
L505135	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	What's that?
L505134	u2746	m179	GRAHAM	Don't call me Father.
L505133	u2749	m179	OFFICER PASKI	It's the strangest thing Father.
L505667	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They'll find a way in.
L505666	u2747	m179	MERRILL	What book!
L505665	u2748	m179	MORGAN	The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
L505558	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Don't worry.
L505557	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
L505552	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They think it might happen all at once.
L505551	u2747	m179	MERRILL	It's like War of the Worlds.
L505550	u2748	m179	MORGAN	They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
L505362	u2747	m179	MERRILL	You'll lose the signal!
L505361	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Don't do it!
L505328	u2747	m179	MERRILL	Yeah.
L505327	u2748	m179	MORGAN	Is that him?
L513715	u2808	m184	JACK	I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
L513714	u2804	m184	BILL	And that makes you look like a squid?
L513713	u2808	m184	JACK	Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
L513712	u2804	m184	BILL	What?
L513707	u2804	m184	BILL	Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
L513706	u2808	m184	JACK	That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
L513705	u2804	m184	BILL	Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
L513704	u2808	m184	JACK	How are you going to find him?
L513702	u2808	m184	JACK	Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
L513701	u2804	m184	BILL	Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
L513700	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
L513699	u2804	m184	BILL	'Mornin', Jack.
L513698	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, we need to talk!
L513697	u2804	m184	BILL	Shit.
L513599	u2804	m184	BILL	You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
L513598	u2808	m184	JACK	Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
L513597	u2808	m184	JACK	Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
L514039	u2812	m184	STARLA	And this is mine.
L514038	u2804	m184	BILL	It's my nature.
L514037	u2812	m184	STARLA	You took Bill.
L514036	u2804	m184	BILL	Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
L514035	u2812	m184	STARLA	Okay.
L514034	u2804	m184	BILL	We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
L514033	u2812	m184	STARLA	Aspirin.
L514032	u2804	m184	BILL	I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
L514028	u2804	m184	BILL	Yeah. Good.
L514027	u2812	m184	STARLA	We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
L513987	u2804	m184	BILL	No, Starla! No!
L513986	u2812	m184	STARLA	He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
L513985	u2804	m184	BILL	What?
L513984	u2812	m184	STARLA	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
L513983	u2804	m184	BILL	What are you doing?!
L513963	u2804	m184	BILL	Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
L513962	u2812	m184	STARLA	After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
L513959	u2804	m184	BILL	I'm sorry.
L513958	u2812	m184	STARLA	That wasn't a good night, no.
L513957	u2804	m184	BILL	When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
L513956	u2812	m184	STARLA	My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
L513955	u2804	m184	BILL	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
L513954	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
L513953	u2812	m184	STARLA	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
L513952	u2804	m184	BILL	Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
L513843	u2812	m184	STARLA	Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
L513842	u2804	m184	BILL	No reception out here.
L513756	u2812	m184	STARLA	It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
L513755	u2804	m184	BILL	Starla, it ain't --
L513754	u2812	m184	STARLA	Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
L513753	u2812	m184	STARLA	He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
L513752	u2804	m184	BILL	He tried to kill you, Starla.
L513751	u2812	m184	STARLA	Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
L513750	u2804	m184	BILL	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
L513749	u2812	m184	STARLA	Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
L513693	u2804	m184	BILL	New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
L513692	u2812	m184	STARLA	How about Brenda?
L513666	u2804	m184	BILL	She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
L513665	u2812	m184	STARLA	No. What??
L513664	u2804	m184	BILL	Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
L513637	u2804	m184	BILL	Hey, Grant.
L513636	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, where'd you go?
L513633	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
L513632	u2804	m184	BILL	Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
L513631	u2812	m184	STARLA	Oh, yeah?
L513630	u2804	m184	BILL	There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
L513629	u2804	m184	BILL	Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
L513628	u2812	m184	STARLA	I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
L513627	u2804	m184	BILL	Pretty, ain't they?
L513626	u2812	m184	STARLA	Just checking out the lights.
L513625	u2804	m184	BILL	What you up to?
L513624	u2804	m184	BILL	Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
L513623	u2812	m184	STARLA	Whatcha' doin'?
L513622	u2804	m184	BILL	Sorry.
L513621	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's not funny.
L513620	u2804	m184	BILL	Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
L513980	u2804	m184	BILL	Just block the doors, any way you can.
L513979	u2813	m184	TREVOR	What the hell are we going to do?!
L513972	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby!
L513971	u2813	m184	TREVOR	When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
L513937	u2804	m184	BILL	A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
L513936	u2813	m184	TREVOR	He's a fucking Martian?!
L513898	u2813	m184	TREVOR	We're coming your way, man!
L513897	u2804	m184	BILL	Where are you?!
L513741	u2813	m184	TREVOR	I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
L513740	u2804	m184	BILL	And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
L513733	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
L513732	u2804	m184	BILL	He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
L513593	u2804	m184	BILL	That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
L513592	u2813	m184	TREVOR	What's she see in that douchebag?
L513805	u2814	m184	WALLY	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
L513804	u2804	m184	BILL	I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
L513739	u2804	m184	BILL	Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
L513738	u2814	m184	WALLY	Looks like a chipmunk.
L513722	u2814	m184	WALLY	What do you see? I see a butterfly.
L513721	u2804	m184	BILL	Rorschach.
L513668	u2804	m184	BILL	The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
L513667	u2814	m184	WALLY	Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
L513643	u2804	m184	BILL	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
L513642	u2814	m184	WALLY	What?
L513641	u2804	m184	BILL	Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
L513640	u2814	m184	WALLY	Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
L513975	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Don't worry, Chief.
L513974	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
L513973	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Hey there, Chief.
L513950	u2804	m184	BILL	Do it.
L513949	u2811	m184	SHELBY	I got to leave my post.
L513948	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
L513918	u2804	m184	BILL	We'll be there in ten minutes.
L513917	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Sorry.
L513916	u2804	m184	BILL	I can't hear when you're nodding.
L513915	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Yeah.
L513914	u2804	m184	BILL	Are you nodding?
L513913	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
L513912	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
L513911	u2804	m184	BILL	Shelby --
L513910	u2811	m184	SHELBY	Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
L513909	u2804	m184	BILL	Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
L513908	u2811	m184	SHELBY	You dig that rat out of the hole?
L513656	u2807	m184	GRANT	Brought you munchies.
L513655	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
L513615	u2807	m184	GRANT	Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
L513614	u2805	m184	BRENDA	What?
L513613	u2807	m184	GRANT	Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
L513610	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
L513609	u2807	m184	GRANT	Where's the old half--Mexican?
L513608	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Shut up.
L513607	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're lookin' awful pretty.
L513527	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
L513526	u2807	m184	GRANT	Already ain't. Married a gal named --
L513525	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
L513524	u2807	m184	GRANT	Who's the lucky fella?
L513523	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Hell, I was game!
L513522	u2807	m184	GRANT	Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
L513521	u2805	m184	BRENDA	My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
L513519	u2807	m184	GRANT	Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
L513518	u2805	m184	BRENDA	Megan Halesy' little sister.
L513567	u2807	m184	GRANT	Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
L513566	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	All the rib eyes?
L513565	u2807	m184	GRANT	Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
L513563	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	How many you need?
L513562	u2807	m184	GRANT	Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
L513561	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	What can I do you for?
L513560	u2807	m184	GRANT	Sure thing, killer.
L513559	u2806	m184	BUTCHER	Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
L513558	u2807	m184	GRANT	Meat.
L513678	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, you're sick!
L513677	u2807	m184	GRANT	I loved you. I loved --
L513676	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, no!
L513675	u2807	m184	GRANT	Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
L513654	u2807	m184	GRANT	No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
L513653	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'll get if for you.
L513651	u2807	m184	GRANT	Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
L513650	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
L513591	u2812	m184	STARLA	It's just one of my students, Grant.
L513590	u2807	m184	GRANT	Who's that?
L513589	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're pretty.
L513588	u2812	m184	STARLA	What are you doing?
L513577	u2807	m184	GRANT	I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
L513576	u2812	m184	STARLA	Okay.
L513575	u2807	m184	GRANT	You're my princess, aren't you?
L513574	u2812	m184	STARLA	My present?
L513573	u2807	m184	GRANT	Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
L513571	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
L513570	u2807	m184	GRANT	Welcome home.
L513547	u2807	m184	GRANT	Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
L513546	u2812	m184	STARLA	I never danced in a towel before.
L513514	u2807	m184	GRANT	Out.
L513513	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's not true -- Where are you--?
L513512	u2807	m184	GRANT	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
L513511	u2812	m184	STARLA	Where are you going?
L513509	u2812	m184	STARLA	That's disrespectful.
L513508	u2807	m184	GRANT	Flip.
L513506	u2807	m184	GRANT	Sure you do.
L513505	u2812	m184	STARLA	I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
L513504	u2812	m184	STARLA	Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
L513500	u2807	m184	GRANT	Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
L513499	u2812	m184	STARLA	It's just a work thing.
L513498	u2807	m184	GRANT	Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
L513497	u2812	m184	STARLA	He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
L513945	u2812	m184	STARLA	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
L513944	u2809	m184	KYLIE	When one sees you they all see you.
L513943	u2812	m184	STARLA	And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
L513942	u2809	m184	KYLIE	He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
L513941	u2812	m184	STARLA	Through a wound on his stomach?
L513940	u2809	m184	KYLIE	Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
L513935	u2812	m184	STARLA	What other stuff?
L513934	u2809	m184	KYLIE	But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
L513858	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Margaret.
L513857	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
L513839	u2813	m184	TREVOR	'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
L513838	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Praise Jesus.
L513787	u2810	m184	MARGARET	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
L513786	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Where'd he go?
L513728	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Hey, look!
L513727	u2810	m184	MARGARET	So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
L513595	u2813	m184	TREVOR	Gold--digger, huh?
L513594	u2810	m184	MARGARET	Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
L518527	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
L518526	u2847	m187	KELVIN	A puppet.
L518525	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	No?  Who am I, then?
L518524	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're not Gibarian...
L518523	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You'll end up like me.
L518522	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I can trust Rheya.
L518521	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
L518520	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
L518519	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Can it work?
L518518	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
L518517	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What do you want?
L518516	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
L518514	u2846	m187	GIBARIAN	Leave the light off.
L518513	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian.
L518668	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Yes.
L518667	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
L518666	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
L518665	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How quickly?
L518664	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
L518663	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Whose side are you on?
L518662	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You fucking bastard...
L518661	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
L518660	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why would you let her to do that?
L518659	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	No, she won't.
L518658	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She'll come back.
L518657	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
L518656	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You murdered her!
L518655	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Not her.  It.
L518654	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You killed her!
L518476	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Why did you agree to come here?
L518475	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That's fantastic.
L518474	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Yes.
L518473	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
L518375	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	She reappeared exactly as she had before?
L518374	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.  There's no behavior modification.
L518236	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
L518235	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Listen --
L518234	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
L518233	u2847	m187	KELVIN	They shouldn't let people like you into space.
L518231	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Her?  Who are you talking about?
L518230	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	In the lab.  With her, probably.
L518229	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's his body?
L518228	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	The same thing that could happen to any of us.
L518227	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
L518226	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
L518225	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want to hear your version.
L518224	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Didn't you talk to Snow?
L518223	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What happened to Gibarian?
L518222	u2847	m187	KELVIN	All right.
L518221	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
L518681	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Maybe you can.
L518680	u2850	m187	SNOW	But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
L518679	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Jesus...
L518678	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
L518677	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When did this happen?
L518672	u2850	m187	SNOW	I won't be making the trip.
L518671	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
L518624	u2850	m187	SNOW	You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
L518623	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I love her.
L518622	u2850	m187	SNOW	You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
L518621	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Into what?
L518620	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
L518619	u2850	m187	SNOW	Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
L518618	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Her oxygen would have run out.
L518617	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
L518616	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.
L518615	u2850	m187	SNOW	What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
L518614	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Just get him to stop.
L518613	u2850	m187	SNOW	What plan?
L518612	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
L518611	u2850	m187	SNOW	What do you want?
L518610	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518609	u2850	m187	SNOW	She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
L518608	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
L518549	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
L518548	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Get out --
L518547	u2850	m187	SNOW	Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
L518544	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She drank liquid oxygen.
L518543	u2850	m187	SNOW	What happened?
L518501	u2850	m187	SNOW	That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
L518500	u2847	m187	KELVIN	They come when you sleep.
L518499	u2850	m187	SNOW	But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
L518498	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Human beings can die.
L518497	u2850	m187	SNOW	Perhaps it did.
L518496	u2847	m187	KELVIN	But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
L518495	u2850	m187	SNOW	Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
L518494	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
L518493	u2850	m187	SNOW	Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
L518492	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518491	u2850	m187	SNOW	We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
L518418	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who are you trying to convince?
L518417	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
L518416	u2850	m187	SNOW	Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
L518415	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not necessarily.
L518414	u2850	m187	SNOW	If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
L518413	u2847	m187	KELVIN	-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
L518412	u2850	m187	SNOW	You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
L518383	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
L518382	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
L518381	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
L518354	u2850	m187	SNOW	Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
L518353	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why?
L518352	u2850	m187	SNOW	Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
L518351	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What is it?
L518350	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, you awake?
L518296	u2850	m187	SNOW	That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
L518295	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
L518294	u2850	m187	SNOW	An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
L518293	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know.
L518292	u2850	m187	SNOW	What are you going to report back to Earth?
L518291	u2847	m187	KELVIN	To who?
L518290	u2850	m187	SNOW	What will you say?
L518289	u2850	m187	SNOW	Told you what?
L518288	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I wish you'd told me.
L518287	u2850	m187	SNOW	Probably.
L518286	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Will she come back?
L518285	u2850	m187	SNOW	It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
L518284	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.
L518283	u2850	m187	SNOW	She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
L518282	u2850	m187	SNOW	Dead?
L518281	u2847	m187	KELVIN	My wife.
L518280	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
L518279	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And professionally?
L518278	u2850	m187	SNOW	Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
L518277	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What was it?
L518276	u2850	m187	SNOW	I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
L518275	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Shut up.
L518274	u2850	m187	SNOW	Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
L518249	u2850	m187	SNOW	Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
L518248	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That depends.
L518247	u2850	m187	SNOW	How long can you go without sleep?
L518246	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How much sleep?
L518245	u2850	m187	SNOW	How much sleep do you need?
L518243	u2850	m187	SNOW	Oh, that's a relief.
L518242	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
L518241	u2847	m187	KELVIN	She was real.  Where did she come from?
L518240	u2850	m187	SNOW	Who was it?
L518239	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
L518238	u2850	m187	SNOW	Why, who did you see?
L518237	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is there anybody else here?
L518218	u2850	m187	SNOW	Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
L518217	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He'll let me in.
L518216	u2850	m187	SNOW	In his lab.  He won't let you in.
L518215	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where's Sartorius?
L518214	u2850	m187	SNOW	I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
L518212	u2850	m187	SNOW	I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
L518211	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What?
L518210	u2850	m187	SNOW	You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
L518208	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How?
L518207	u2850	m187	SNOW	He's dead.
L518206	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
L518690	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
L518689	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How can you be here...
L518640	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You must have been dreaming.
L518639	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
L518638	u2848	m187	RHEYA	When?
L518637	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where did you go before?
L518634	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Please.  Don't.
L518633	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have ""an arrangement"".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?"
L518629	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
L518628	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What does it want?
L518627	u2847	m187	KELVIN	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
L518626	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What are you taking?
L518606	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
L518605	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Am I really her?
L518604	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
L518603	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I can't --
L518602	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
L518601	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
L518600	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I think they help.
L518599	u2848	m187	RHEYA	They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
L518598	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I wish you wouldn't.
L518597	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I want to stop taking those pills.
L518596	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Is that really what you want?
L518595	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But then I would be dead now.
L518594	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
L518593	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
L518592	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes, you are --
L518591	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
L518590	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Who are you, then?
L518589	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
L518588	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You exist here.  I keep telling you.
L518587	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're lying.
L518586	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want you here.
L518585	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What do I have to do to stop it?
L518579	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Then you won't make it.
L518578	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
L518577	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I can't stay here.
L518576	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris --
L518575	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I never said I didn't.
L518574	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You never said you wanted one.
L518573	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Neither did I.
L518572	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
L518571	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Thank you.
L518570	u2848	m187	RHEYA	It wouldn't have made any difference.
L518569	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You should have told me.
L518568	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
L518562	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I want every second I can get with you.
L518561	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Then you'll die.
L518560	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
L518559	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're lying.  I'm not human.
L518558	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.
L518557	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm disgusting.
L518556	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
L518555	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't call me that.
L518554	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya --
L518553	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
L518542	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
L518541	u2848	m187	RHEYA	How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
L518540	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no ""You"" from before."
L518539	u2847	m187	KELVIN	That won't happen again.  We're different.
L518538	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
L518537	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I love you.
L518536	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
L518535	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's all right.
L518534	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What's happening to us?
L518531	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He is.  But he was here...
L518530	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You said he was dead.
L518529	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Gibarian.  He was here.
L518528	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What's wrong?
L518512	u2848	m187	RHEYA	If you're here.
L518511	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Do you?
L518510	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do you want to stay here?
L518509	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not this time.
L518508	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But that's what happened before.
L518507	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
L518506	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
L518505	u2847	m187	KELVIN	For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
L518504	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
L518503	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.
L518502	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You don't want me.
L518481	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
L518480	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
L518479	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You're the coward.
L518470	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Those are dreams.
L518469	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
L518468	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Can you sleep?
L518467	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I love you, too.
L518466	u2847	m187	KELVIN	No.  I love you.
L518465	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Was she right?
L518464	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You... she said I didn't love her.
L518463	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Why did she do it?
L518462	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  Especially toward the end.
L518461	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But we fought.
L518458	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
L518457	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
L518456	u2847	m187	KELVIN	When?  When I'm asleep?
L518455	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Sartorius.
L518454	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Who have you been talking to?
L518453	u2848	m187	RHEYA	That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
L518452	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What are you talking about?
L518449	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Stop.
L518448	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You don't love me.
L518447	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What's wrong.
L518443	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'm glad.
L518442	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.  Yes.
L518441	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do I really feel like... I am...?
L518440	u2848	m187	RHEYA	It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
L518439	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
L518438	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
L518437	u2847	m187	KELVIN	He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
L518436	u2848	m187	RHEYA	He has a point.
L518435	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
L518434	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Sartorius wants to destroy it.
L518433	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
L518432	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What does Snow think you should do?
L518430	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
L518429	u2848	m187	RHEYA	"You sure say ""God"" a lot when we're doing it."
L518426	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
L518425	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
L518424	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I like that too.
L518423	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
L518422	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I think so.
L518421	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
L518411	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
L518410	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
L518407	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
L518406	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Why did you say those things?
L518402	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You don't know?
L518401	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What happened to us, exactly?
L518398	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I did too.
L518397	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
L518395	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
L518394	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
L518393	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What kind of look?
L518392	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
L518391	u2847	m187	KELVIN	How old were you?
L518390	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
L518388	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
L518387	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Where've you been?
L518359	u2848	m187	RHEYA	When I saw you were gone I got scared.
L518358	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
L518357	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What happened?
L518348	u2848	m187	RHEYA	As I said, then it's God, right?
L518347	u2847	m187	KELVIN	As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
L518346	u2848	m187	RHEYA	But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
L518345	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
L518344	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
L518343	u2847	m187	KELVIN	The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
L518342	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You still don't believe in God?
L518341	u2847	m187	KELVIN	It's something.
L518340	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Then it's God, right?
L518339	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
L518338	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Is it intelligent?
L518337	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
L518336	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Is it a planet?
L518335	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
L518334	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
L518333	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What do you mean?
L518332	u2847	m187	KELVIN	What do you remember?
L518330	u2847	m187	KELVIN	All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
L518329	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
L518328	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You're better when you take them.
L518326	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You talk like an actor.
L518325	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
L518324	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You go home.
L518323	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Let's go home.
L518322	u2848	m187	RHEYA	And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
L518321	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya.  Not here.
L518320	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You behave as though you want to fuck her.
L518319	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Stop it.
L518318	u2848	m187	RHEYA	You want to fuck her?
L518316	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Better.
L518315	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And tonight?
L518314	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I wasn't.
L518313	u2847	m187	KELVIN	You didn't look very happy.
L518312	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Not a very happy poem.
L518311	u2848	m187	RHEYA	My Thomas is a little rusty.
L518310	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
L518309	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Book?
L518308	u2847	m187	KELVIN	And Death Shall Have No Dominion.
L518307	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I want you inside me right now.
L518306	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Rheya...
L518272	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Yes.
L518271	u2848	m187	RHEYA	We're taking a flight?
L518270	u2848	m187	RHEYA	To calm my anxiety.
L518269	u2847	m187	KELVIN	To calm your anxiety.
L518268	u2848	m187	RHEYA	What are they?
L518266	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'll be right back.
L518265	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I don't know.  I can't be alone.
L518264	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Why?
L518263	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Don't.
L518262	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I'll just be a minute.
L518261	u2848	m187	RHEYA	I'll go with you.
L518260	u2847	m187	KELVIN	I need to see Snow.
L518253	u2848	m187	RHEYA	Yes.
L518252	u2847	m187	KELVIN	Oh, God.  I'm awake.
L518683	u2850	m187	SNOW	You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
L518682	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	You want it coming back with us?
L518676	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Fuck me.  I knew it.
L518675	u2850	m187	SNOW	I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
L518674	u2850	m187	SNOW	I'm not Snow.
L518673	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Snow, get up here, now.
L518472	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
L518471	u2850	m187	SNOW	Gibarian was under enormous --
L518380	u2850	m187	SNOW	Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
L518379	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Followed by non-human manifestations.
L518378	u2850	m187	SNOW	And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
L518377	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
L518373	u2850	m187	SNOW	It's an experiment.
L518372	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
L518368	u2850	m187	SNOW	We want to talk freely.
L518367	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
L518365	u2850	m187	SNOW	He won't.
L518364	u2849	m187	SARTORIUS	Why do you say that?
L518363	u2850	m187	SNOW	He won't do it.
L530025	u2871	m189	LIZ	Let me see.
L530024	u2863	m189	ADELE	Peter-- you took this picture?
L530017	u2871	m189	LIZ	Be nice.
L530016	u2863	m189	ADELE	And Flash isn't?
L530011	u2863	m189	ADELE	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
L530010	u2871	m189	LIZ	Well, look who's dressing for success.
L529867	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
L529866	u2863	m189	ADELE	Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
L529862	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
L529861	u2863	m189	ADELE	Sexual tension...
L529663	u2864	m189	BEN	I'm always here, Pete.
L529662	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.
L529661	u2864	m189	BEN	When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
L529659	u2864	m189	BEN	-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
L529658	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
L529657	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
L529656	u2876	m189	PETER	No, no.
L529655	u2864	m189	BEN	Cause if you get in a bind--
L529654	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, sure.
L529653	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
L529652	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
L529651	u2876	m189	PETER	Remember Little League?
L529650	u2864	m189	BEN	S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
L529649	u2876	m189	PETER	No?not really.
L529648	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
L529647	u2864	m189	BEN	Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
L529646	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
L529645	u2864	m189	BEN	Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
L529644	u2876	m189	PETER	You stop him?
L529643	u2864	m189	BEN	Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
L529642	u2876	m189	PETER	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
L529641	u2864	m189	BEN	So, uh... how's college goin'?
L529640	u2876	m189	PETER	No. No, that's okay.
L529639	u2864	m189	BEN	What, want a glass?
L529638	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
L529637	u2864	m189	BEN	Here you go, Pete.
L530253	u2866	m189	HARRY	Or was it all a dream?
L530252	u2865	m189	FLASH	See?
L530251	u2866	m189	HARRY	I was there.
L530021	u2865	m189	FLASH	-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
L530020	u2866	m189	HARRY	Flash, drop it--
L530019	u2865	m189	FLASH	No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
L530018	u2866	m189	HARRY	Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
L530194	u2865	m189	FLASH	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
L530193	u2871	m189	LIZ	Flash, get lost.
L530029	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  What a lump.
L530028	u2865	m189	FLASH	Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
L530015	u2871	m189	LIZ	I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
L530014	u2865	m189	FLASH	Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
L529590	u2865	m189	FLASH	I'm parked illegally!
L529589	u2871	m189	LIZ	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
L529588	u2865	m189	FLASH	Lizzy!
L530256	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
L530255	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
L530254	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
L530188	u2866	m189	HARRY	I got you a present.
L530187	u2876	m189	PETER	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
L530186	u2866	m189	HARRY	You get mugged or something?
L530009	u2876	m189	PETER	You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
L530008	u2866	m189	HARRY	And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
L530007	u2876	m189	PETER	Mm-hmm.
L530006	u2866	m189	HARRY	Jesus Christ.
L529813	u2866	m189	HARRY	I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
L529812	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't be pitiful.
L529811	u2866	m189	HARRY	You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
L529810	u2866	m189	HARRY	Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
L529809	u2876	m189	PETER	Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
L529808	u2866	m189	HARRY	Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
L529807	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  I've got one too.
L529806	u2866	m189	HARRY	Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.
L529805	u2876	m189	PETER	Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
L529804	u2866	m189	HARRY	Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.
L529803	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry?
L529802	u2866	m189	HARRY	Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
L529561	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry!
L529560	u2866	m189	HARRY	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
L529559	u2876	m189	PETER	What's in there?
L529558	u2866	m189	HARRY	They'll never take me alive.
L529557	u2876	m189	PETER	You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
L529755	u2876	m189	PETER	Right.
L529754	u2867	m189	HOGAN	You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
L529753	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
L529752	u2867	m189	HOGAN	How are you doing, kid?
L529748	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Get away from me, freak!
L529747	u2876	m189	PETER	Are you okay?
L529746	u2876	m189	PETER	That's not even close.
L529745	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Lemme down, bugface!
L529744	u2876	m189	PETER	Now tell me you love me.
L529836	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
L529835	u2876	m189	PETER	Can I get a word in edgewise?
L529834	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
L529833	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529832	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
L529831	u2876	m189	PETER	You print pictures of Bigfoot!
L529830	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
L529829	u2876	m189	PETER	Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
L529828	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
L529827	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529826	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
L529825	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
L529824	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
L529712	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
L529711	u2876	m189	PETER	Can't focus...
L529699	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
L529698	u2876	m189	PETER	Can we make it a hundred?
L529697	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
L529696	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah--
L529695	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
L529694	u2876	m189	PETER	You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
L529599	u2868	m189	JAMESON	You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
L529598	u2876	m189	PETER	Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
L529595	u2876	m189	PETER	I think you're trying to tell me something.
L529594	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
L530125	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Hmf-hrr?
L530124	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
L530122	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Fine.
L530121	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Frmpph-yrr.
L530120	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
L530119	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
L530118	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Would you cool it already?
L530117	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
L530116	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
L529766	u2876	m189	PETER	Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
L529765	u2869	m189	LEIBER	An even five I throw in the jacket.
L529764	u2876	m189	PETER	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
L529763	u2869	m189	LEIBER	You're making my life difficult.
L529762	u2876	m189	PETER	How about tomorrow?
L529761	u2869	m189	LEIBER	Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
L529760	u2876	m189	PETER	A spider.  Eight legs.
L529759	u2869	m189	LEIBER	What's this? A cockaroach?
L529758	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
L529757	u2869	m189	LEIBER	No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
L529991	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
L529990	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Are you quite finished?
L529922	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
L529921	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
L529916	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Well...
L529915	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
L529914	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thanks, I already ate.
L529913	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
L529912	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just call me Spidey.
L529911	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
L529910	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
L529909	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
L530139	u2873	m189	MAY	What if the world ends tomorrow?
L530138	u2871	m189	LIZ	What if you get hurt?
L530137	u2873	m189	MAY	Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
L530136	u2871	m189	LIZ	Even if they're not clever.
L530135	u2873	m189	MAY	Some things you should say anyway.
L530134	u2871	m189	LIZ	He knew.
L530133	u2873	m189	MAY	Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
L530128	u2871	m189	LIZ	I don't think he wants me to find him.
L530127	u2873	m189	MAY	When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
L530126	u2871	m189	LIZ	He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
L530269	u2876	m189	PETER	Nah.
L530268	u2871	m189	LIZ	This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
L530267	u2871	m189	LIZ	Why?
L530266	u2876	m189	PETER	Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
L530265	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
L530264	u2876	m189	PETER	I... I like you.  A lot.
L530263	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
L530262	u2876	m189	PETER	Hello, Liz.
L530203	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm here...
L530202	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter?
L530201	u2871	m189	LIZ	Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is? what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
L530200	u2876	m189	PETER	Strong...
L530199	u2871	m189	LIZ	Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
L530198	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, God, I forgot to--
L530197	u2871	m189	LIZ	May's much better. She'll be out soon.
L530196	u2871	m189	LIZ	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
L530195	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
L530090	u2876	m189	PETER	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
L530089	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
L530087	u2871	m189	LIZ	I know what you mean.  I...
L530086	u2876	m189	PETER	Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
L530085	u2871	m189	LIZ	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
L530084	u2876	m189	PETER	You'd feel what?
L530083	u2871	m189	LIZ	"So?  The next day I'd read, ""Peter Parker murdered,"" and I'd feel..."
L530082	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, no.
L530081	u2871	m189	LIZ	You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
L530080	u2876	m189	PETER	They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
L530079	u2876	m189	PETER	I think I'd like that.
L530078	u2871	m189	LIZ	Do you mind if I come too?
L530077	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
L530073	u2876	m189	PETER	That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
L530072	u2871	m189	LIZ	This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
L530071	u2876	m189	PETER	No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
L530070	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, don't do it on my account--
L530069	u2876	m189	PETER	Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
L530068	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's in the bag?  Garbage?
L529870	u2871	m189	LIZ	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
L529869	u2876	m189	PETER	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
L529868	u2871	m189	LIZ	Sit down and stop being such a child.
L529865	u2876	m189	PETER	I've got no problems.
L529864	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's your problem?
L529863	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
L529860	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sure you kept warm.
L529859	u2871	m189	LIZ	Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
L529858	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi, Adele.
L529857	u2871	m189	LIZ	Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
L529587	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh. Maybe I should, too--
L529586	u2876	m189	PETER	I've gotta study.
L529585	u2871	m189	LIZ	What are you doing this weekend?
L529584	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hurry up, Flash!
L529583	u2876	m189	PETER	I'd never admit that.
L529582	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like ""Flash."""
L529581	u2876	m189	PETER	Does it have a human name?
L529580	u2871	m189	LIZ	Some prep school thing.
L529579	u2876	m189	PETER	"Flash, Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself ""Flash."""
L529578	u2871	m189	LIZ	You should write that one down.
L529577	u2876	m189	PETER	But you like that in a man?
L529576	u2871	m189	LIZ	God, Flash can be such a jerk.
L529575	u2876	m189	PETER	What?
L529574	u2871	m189	LIZ	You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
L529573	u2876	m189	PETER	I suppose.
L529572	u2871	m189	LIZ	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
L529571	u2876	m189	PETER	My my.
L529570	u2871	m189	LIZ	Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
L529569	u2876	m189	PETER	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
L529568	u2871	m189	LIZ	He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
L529567	u2876	m189	PETER	Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
L529566	u2871	m189	LIZ	Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
L529565	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
L529548	u2876	m189	PETER	Thank God.
L529547	u2871	m189	LIZ	No.  I was lying about the coffee.
L529544	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
L529543	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate--
L529542	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate people with alliterative names.
L529541	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate the Platonic idea of you.
L529540	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
L529539	u2876	m189	PETER	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
L529538	u2871	m189	LIZ	Uh is a good start.
L529537	u2876	m189	PETER	I-- uh--
L529536	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Fill in the blank: ""I blank Elizabeth Allan."""
L529535	u2876	m189	PETER	Huh?
L529534	u2871	m189	LIZ	It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
L529533	u2876	m189	PETER	It's too early to be clever.
L529532	u2871	m189	LIZ	How very dull, Peter Parker.
L529531	u2876	m189	PETER	Good morning, Liz.
L530211	u2878	m189	ROZ	Precise equipment? such as waldos?
L530210	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
L530208	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
L530207	u2878	m189	ROZ	Any sign of our friend?
L530206	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, Roz.
L530052	u2878	m189	ROZ	Peter-- my condolences.
L530051	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
L530050	u2878	m189	ROZ	"No such thing as coincidence.  ""God does not play dice with the universe."""
L530049	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
L530048	u2878	m189	ROZ	Of course.
L530046	u2878	m189	ROZ	I know him.
L530045	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You sure about all this?
L530044	u2878	m189	ROZ	And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
L530043	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Toxic dumps, huh.
L530042	u2878	m189	ROZ	There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
L530041	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
L530040	u2878	m189	ROZ	Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
L530039	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
L530038	u2878	m189	ROZ	Waldos.
L530037	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
L530036	u2878	m189	ROZ	Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
L530035	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Some of him? char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
L530034	u2878	m189	ROZ	So you've found Thorkel?
L530033	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
L529980	u2873	m189	MAY	He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
L529979	u2876	m189	PETER	How is he?
L529978	u2873	m189	MAY	I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
L529977	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, what happened?
L529976	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Ben gets through everything.
L529975	u2876	m189	PETER	It's fine.  Tell me what--
L529974	u2873	m189	MAY	Peter, you're bleeding.
L529675	u2873	m189	MAY	See?  You big dullard.
L529674	u2876	m189	PETER	A match made in heaven.
L529671	u2873	m189	MAY	Use a fork.
L529670	u2876	m189	PETER	Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
L529669	u2873	m189	MAY	Absolutely no class.
L529668	u2873	m189	MAY	You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
L529667	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
L529665	u2873	m189	MAY	Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
L529664	u2876	m189	PETER	What the hell is that?
L529620	u2873	m189	MAY	It'll shut itself off.
L529619	u2876	m189	PETER	The record--
L529618	u2876	m189	PETER	No.
L529617	u2873	m189	MAY	Yes.  Do you have a date?
L529616	u2876	m189	PETER	It's Friday night...
L529615	u2873	m189	MAY	Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
L529614	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm a photographer, remember?
L529613	u2873	m189	MAY	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
L529612	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll introduce you.
L529611	u2873	m189	MAY	--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
L529610	u2876	m189	PETER	I am old enough to--
L529608	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Peter. A zit.
L529607	u2876	m189	PETER	When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
L529606	u2873	m189	MAY	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
L529605	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, you're trespassing.
L529604	u2873	m189	MAY	That's the understatement of the year.
L529603	u2876	m189	PETER	There's nothing in there worth stealing!
L529719	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
L529718	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
L529717	u2876	m189	PETER	I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
L529716	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Is this some sort of Zen thing?
L529715	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
L529714	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Poison emergency.
L529797	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
L529796	u2875	m189	OCK	I will finish what I've begun?
L529795	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering? the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron?
L529636	u2875	m189	OCK	No!
L529635	u2880	m189	THORKEL	That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
L529632	u2875	m189	OCK	I don't care.  Cretin.
L529631	u2880	m189	THORKEL	You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
L529630	u2875	m189	OCK	This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
L529629	u2880	m189	THORKEL	What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
L529628	u2875	m189	OCK	I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
L529627	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
L529626	u2880	m189	THORKEL	I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
L529625	u2875	m189	OCK	In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
L529624	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Let's talk in the hall.
L529623	u2875	m189	OCK	Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
L529622	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
L529621	u2875	m189	OCK	Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
L530218	u2878	m189	ROZ	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
L530217	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
L530216	u2878	m189	ROZ	My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
L529791	u2875	m189	OCK	Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
L529790	u2878	m189	ROZ	Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
L529789	u2878	m189	ROZ	No. It isn't.
L529788	u2875	m189	OCK	I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
L529787	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
L529786	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
L529785	u2878	m189	ROZ	Creation? Or its opposite?
L529784	u2875	m189	OCK	You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
L529783	u2878	m189	ROZ	All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
L529782	u2875	m189	OCK	My? self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
L529780	u2875	m189	OCK	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
L529779	u2878	m189	ROZ	A bit melodramatic? but if you could prove it? that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
L529682	u2875	m189	OCK	I left a paper in my desk.
L529681	u2878	m189	ROZ	I heard about Thorkel's order--
L529680	u2875	m189	OCK	No.  No thank you.  I have work.
L529529	u2878	m189	ROZ	Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
L529528	u2875	m189	OCK	Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
L529527	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
L530260	u2878	m189	ROZ	If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
L530259	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
L530258	u2878	m189	ROZ	The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
L530058	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll try. Thanks.
L530057	u2878	m189	ROZ	You never know.  Go get some sleep.
L530056	u2876	m189	PETER	I don't think I'll be running into him.
L530055	u2878	m189	ROZ	Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
L530054	u2876	m189	PETER	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
L530053	u2878	m189	ROZ	"This photo you took of ""Spider-Man"" -"
L529889	u2878	m189	ROZ	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
L529888	u2876	m189	PETER	Need any more help?
L529883	u2878	m189	ROZ	Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
L529882	u2876	m189	PETER	Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
L529881	u2878	m189	ROZ	How much do you know about it?
L529880	u2876	m189	PETER	Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
L529879	u2878	m189	ROZ	Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.

L529563	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi, Professor.  What's up?
L529562	u2878	m189	ROZ	Mr. Parker.
L529845	u2877	m189	REISS	Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
L529844	u2876	m189	PETER	Why? It is a wrestling match, or?
L529843	u2877	m189	REISS	Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
L529842	u2876	m189	PETER	No?
L529841	u2877	m189	REISS	I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
L529840	u2876	m189	PETER	Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?

L529749	u2877	m189	REISS	Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
L529931	u2877	m189	REISS	I just gave-- yeah, sure.
L529930	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
L529929	u2877	m189	REISS	Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
L529928	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
L529927	u2877	m189	REISS	I asked if you felt like a drink--
L529926	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	What?
L529925	u2877	m189	REISS	... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
L529924	u2877	m189	REISS	Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
L529923	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	So they're airing this tonight?
L529906	u2877	m189	REISS	Nah.  The big mask was better.

L530176	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Phooey on that.
L530175	u2878	m189	ROZ	I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
L530174	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.

L545349	u2903	m191	KIRK	Thanks for pointing that out.
L545348	u2898	m191	CHEKOV	Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
L545833	u2906	m191	PICARD	I have to find a way to get to Soran.
L545832	u2899	m191	DATA	Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
L545828	u2899	m191	DATA	Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
L545827	u2906	m191	PICARD	Commander.
L545826	u2899	m191	DATA	Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-
L545802	u2899	m191	DATA	Approximately two hundred thirty million.
L545801	u2906	m191	PICARD	Population?
L545800	u2899	m191	DATA	Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
L545799	u2906	m191	PICARD	Are any of them inhabited?
L545798	u2906	m191	PICARD	And destroy every planet in the system.
L545797	u2899	m191	DATA	It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
L545796	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's where he's going.
L545793	u2899	m191	DATA	Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
L545792	u2906	m191	PICARD	He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
L545789	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe so.
L545788	u2906	m191	PICARD	Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
L545785	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe so.
L545784	u2906	m191	PICARD	Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
L545781	u2906	m191	PICARD	Can you project its course?
L545780	u2899	m191	DATA	This is its current position.
L545778	u2899	m191	DATA	The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
L545777	u2906	m191	PICARD	Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
L545776	u2899	m191	DATA	According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
L545775	u2899	m191	DATA	Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
L545774	u2906	m191	PICARD	No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
L545773	u2899	m191	DATA	But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
L545772	u2906	m191	PICARD	Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
L545771	u2899	m191	DATA	I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
L545770	u2906	m191	PICARD	What do you mean?
L545769	u2899	m191	DATA	No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
L545768	u2906	m191	PICARD	Data, are you all right?
L545767	u2899	m191	DATA	It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
L545766	u2906	m191	PICARD	Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
L545765	u2899	m191	DATA	The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
L545764	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
L545763	u2899	m191	DATA	Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
L545762	u2906	m191	PICARD	Data?
L545761	u2906	m191	PICARD	When is it expected back?
L545760	u2899	m191	DATA	According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
L545926	u2899	m191	DATA	One minute to warp core breach.
L545925	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
L545639	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
L545638	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
L545637	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, are you all right?
L545635	u2899	m191	DATA	I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
L545634	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, this isn't the time.
L545625	u2899	m191	DATA	It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
L545624	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
L545621	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Thanks.
L545620	u2899	m191	DATA	I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
L545619	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
L545618	u2899	m191	DATA	During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
L545617	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What?
L545615	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	You get what?
L545614	u2899	m191	DATA	I get it. I get it.
L545589	u2899	m191	DATA	I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
L545588	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Really? What do you feel?
L545587	u2899	m191	DATA	I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
L545586	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Well?
L545572	u2899	m191	DATA	Agreed.
L545571	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
L545569	u2899	m191	DATA	"That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more ""human""- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer."
L545568	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
L545567	u2899	m191	DATA	It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
L545566	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
L545565	u2899	m191	DATA	I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
L545564	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
L545563	u2899	m191	DATA	Is she still angry?
L545934	u2907	m191	RIKER	All hands, brace for impact!
L545933	u2899	m191	DATA	I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
L545903	u2899	m191	DATA	Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
L545902	u2907	m191	RIKER	Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
L545716	u2899	m191	DATA	I hope so, sir.
L545715	u2907	m191	RIKER	We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
L545714	u2899	m191	DATA	I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
L545713	u2907	m191	RIKER	Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
L545544	u2907	m191	RIKER	The station complement was nineteen.
L545543	u2899	m191	DATA	Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
L545488	u2900	m191	DEMORA	There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
L545487	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
L545475	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	I'll go. You have the Bridge.
L545474	u2900	m191	DEMORA	Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
L545433	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Beam them directly to Sickbay.
L545432	u2900	m191	DEMORA	We're within range, sir.
L545407	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	On screen.
L545406	u2900	m191	DEMORA	We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
L545402	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
L545401	u2900	m191	DEMORA	The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
L545400	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Can you locate them?
L545984	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
L545983	u2906	m191	PICARD	You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
L545982	u2901	m191	GUINAN	What makes you think things will be any different this time?
L545981	u2906	m191	PICARD	I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
L545980	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
L545979	u2906	m191	PICARD	I don't understand.
L545978	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Yes, where would you go?
L545977	u2906	m191	PICARD	Can I?
L545976	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Why would you want to leave?
L545975	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
L545971	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
L545970	u2906	m191	PICARD	These are my children...my children.
L545967	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Wherever he wanted to be.
L545966	u2906	m191	PICARD	Where is he now?
L545965	u2901	m191	GUINAN	All of us.
L545964	u2906	m191	PICARD	Soran?
L545963	u2901	m191	GUINAN	When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
L545962	u2906	m191	PICARD	Left behind?
L545961	u2901	m191	GUINAN	"I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an ""echo"" of the person you know. A part she left behind."
L545960	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
L545959	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
L545958	u2906	m191	PICARD	But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
L545957	u2901	m191	GUINAN	For you. This is where you wanted to be.
L545956	u2906	m191	PICARD	This is the Nexus?
L545955	u2901	m191	GUINAN	You're in the Nexus.
L545954	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
L545737	u2906	m191	PICARD	But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
L545736	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
L545735	u2906	m191	PICARD	"Your ""sixth sense""- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?"
L545734	u2901	m191	GUINAN	It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
L545730	u2901	m191	GUINAN	I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
L545729	u2906	m191	PICARD	What happened to you?
L545728	u2901	m191	GUINAN	That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
L545726	u2906	m191	PICARD	"What's the ""Nexus""?"
L545725	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
L545724	u2906	m191	PICARD	Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
L545723	u2901	m191	GUINAN	Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
L545722	u2906	m191	PICARD	Do you remember him?
L545429	u2903	m191	KIRK	Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
L545428	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
L545416	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
L545415	u2903	m191	KIRK	You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
L545414	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	We don't have a tractor beam.
L545391	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Please, I insist.
L545390	u2903	m191	KIRK	No, no. Thank you.
L545389	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
L545388	u2903	m191	KIRK	Oh, of course.
L545387	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
L545365	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	Please, please.
L545364	u2903	m191	KIRK	Well, may we have a look around?
L545362	u2903	m191	KIRK	It's our pleasure.
L545361	u2902	m191	HARRIMAN	I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
L546053	u2903	m191	KIRK	Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
L546052	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes.  Thank you.
L546051	u2903	m191	KIRK	Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
L546050	u2906	m191	PICARD	I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
L546042	u2903	m191	KIRK	Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
L546041	u2906	m191	PICARD	You could say that.
L546040	u2903	m191	KIRK	I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
L546039	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's right.
L546038	u2903	m191	KIRK	How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
L546035	u2906	m191	PICARD	I hadn't planned on it.
L546034	u2903	m191	KIRK	Close to retirement?
L546033	u2906	m191	PICARD	That's right.
L546032	u2903	m191	KIRK	Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
L546030	u2903	m191	KIRK	She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
L546029	u2906	m191	PICARD	Antonia?
L546024	u2903	m191	KIRK	This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
L546023	u2906	m191	PICARD	Better?
L546022	u2903	m191	KIRK	No, no, it's not. It's better.
L546018	u2903	m191	KIRK	I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
L546017	u2906	m191	PICARD	You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
L546016	u2903	m191	KIRK	You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
L546013	u2903	m191	KIRK	Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
L546012	u2906	m191	PICARD	Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
L546011	u2903	m191	KIRK	So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
L545996	u2906	m191	PICARD	I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
L545995	u2903	m191	KIRK	This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
L545988	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes, yes, it is.
L545987	u2903	m191	KIRK	Beautiful day, isn't it?
L545482	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
L545481	u2903	m191	KIRK	Kirk here.
L545478	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	I always do.
L545477	u2903	m191	KIRK	Keep her together until I get back.
L545473	u2903	m191	KIRK	Where are the deflector relays?
L545472	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
L545469	u2903	m191	KIRK	Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
L545468	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Aye.
L545467	u2903	m191	KIRK	A photon torpedo?
L545466	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
L545465	u2903	m191	KIRK	I thought you might.
L545464	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	But I do have a theory...
L545462	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
L545461	u2903	m191	KIRK	The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
L545443	u2903	m191	KIRK	Phasing? To where?
L545442	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
L545384	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
L545383	u2903	m191	KIRK	Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
L545382	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	And what would that be, sir?
L545381	u2903	m191	KIRK	You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
L545356	u2903	m191	KIRK	When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
L545355	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
L545354	u2903	m191	KIRK	I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
L545351	u2908	m191	SCOTTY	I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
L545350	u2903	m191	KIRK	Oh
L545758	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
L545757	u2909	m191	SORAN	We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
L545756	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No, I didn't know that.
L545755	u2909	m191	SORAN	I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
L545754	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
L545753	u2909	m191	SORAN	Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
L545751	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
L545750	u2909	m191	SORAN	What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
L545749	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	No.
L545748	u2909	m191	SORAN	Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
L545747	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	I was ordered to by the Captain.
L545746	u2909	m191	SORAN	I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
L545743	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What do you want?
L545742	u2909	m191	SORAN	Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
L545741	u2904	m191	LA FORGE	What's normal?
L545740	u2909	m191	SORAN	A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
L546082	u2906	m191	PICARD	You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
L546081	u2907	m191	RIKER	I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
L545831	u2906	m191	PICARD	Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
L545830	u2907	m191	RIKER	That's a pretty big margin of error.
L545822	u2906	m191	PICARD	They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
L545821	u2907	m191	RIKER	Maybe they're not out there.
L545672	u2906	m191	PICARD	How is that possible?
L545671	u2907	m191	RIKER	A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
L545670	u2906	m191	PICARD	Report.
L545584	u2906	m191	PICARD	No. Thank you.
L545583	u2907	m191	RIKER	Sir, is there anything wrong?
L545582	u2906	m191	PICARD	Understood. That will be all.
L545581	u2907	m191	RIKER	There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
L545580	u2906	m191	PICARD	Thank you, Number One.
L545579	u2907	m191	RIKER	No, sir.
L545578	u2906	m191	PICARD	Is there a problem?
L545577	u2907	m191	RIKER	You want me to contact Starfleet?
L545576	u2906	m191	PICARD	Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
L545575	u2907	m191	RIKER	We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
L545574	u2906	m191	PICARD	There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
L545547	u2906	m191	PICARD	Make it so.
L545546	u2907	m191	RIKER	Sir?
L545524	u2907	m191	RIKER	Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
L545523	u2906	m191	PICARD	Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
L545521	u2907	m191	RIKER	Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
L545520	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
L545511	u2907	m191	RIKER	When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
L545510	u2906	m191	PICARD	Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
L545824	u2906	m191	PICARD	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
L545823	u2910	m191	TROI	Or perhaps they're on the surface.
L545664	u2910	m191	TROI	There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
L545663	u2906	m191	PICARD	My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
L545662	u2910	m191	TROI	You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
L545661	u2906	m191	PICARD	Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
L545660	u2910	m191	TROI	Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
L545659	u2906	m191	PICARD	In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
L545658	u2910	m191	TROI	It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
L545657	u2906	m191	PICARD	What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
L545656	u2910	m191	TROI	Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
L545654	u2906	m191	PICARD	All right, all right. You've made your point.
L545653	u2910	m191	TROI	"Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  ""Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"""
L545652	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
L545651	u2910	m191	TROI	You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
L545650	u2906	m191	PICARD	As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
L545649	u2910	m191	TROI	I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
L545648	u2906	m191	PICARD	Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
L545647	u2910	m191	TROI	Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
L545646	u2906	m191	PICARD	Counselor. What can I do for you?
L545532	u2906	m191	PICARD	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
L545531	u2910	m191	TROI	Captain, are you all right?
L545884	u2906	m191	PICARD	Thank you.
L545883	u2909	m191	SORAN	Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
L545880	u2909	m191	SORAN	Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
L545879	u2906	m191	PICARD	The Nexus.
L545878	u2909	m191	SORAN	What if I told you I found a new truth?
L545877	u2906	m191	PICARD	We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
L545867	u2906	m191	PICARD	Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
L545866	u2909	m191	SORAN	I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
L545856	u2909	m191	SORAN	The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
L545855	u2906	m191	PICARD	The thought had crossed my mind.
L545854	u2909	m191	SORAN	You must think I'm quite the madman.
L545604	u2906	m191	PICARD	We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
L545603	u2909	m191	SORAN	The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
L545602	u2906	m191	PICARD	Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
L545601	u2909	m191	SORAN	Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
L545600	u2906	m191	PICARD	Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
L545599	u2909	m191	SORAN	Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
L545598	u2906	m191	PICARD	Doctor Soran?
L545909	u2907	m191	RIKER	We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
L545908	u2911	m191	WORF	Aye, sir.
L545907	u2907	m191	RIKER	Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
L545905	u2907	m191	RIKER	Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
L545904	u2911	m191	WORF	As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
L545900	u2911	m191	WORF	I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
L545899	u2907	m191	RIKER	Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
L545898	u2911	m191	WORF	It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
L545894	u2907	m191	RIKER	Lock phasers and return fire!
L545893	u2911	m191	WORF	They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
L545708	u2907	m191	RIKER	Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
L545707	u2911	m191	WORF	I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
L545674	u2907	m191	RIKER	The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
L545673	u2911	m191	WORF	Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
L545612	u2911	m191	WORF	Aye, sir.
L545611	u2907	m191	RIKER	Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
L545610	u2907	m191	RIKER	Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
L545609	u2911	m191	WORF	An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
L545608	u2907	m191	RIKER	Trilithium?
L545607	u2911	m191	WORF	One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
L545549	u2907	m191	RIKER	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
L545548	u2911	m191	WORF	These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
L545542	u2911	m191	WORF	There are no other ships in the system.
L545541	u2907	m191	RIKER	It looks like we're too late.
L545536	u2907	m191	RIKER	You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
L545535	u2911	m191	WORF	The royal...studs?
L535048	u2927	m192	STYLES	Execute!
L535047	u2912	m192	1ST OFFICER	Transwarp at your command, Sir!
L535039	u2927	m192	STYLES	If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
L535038	u2912	m192	1ST OFFICER	Tractor beam, aye!
L535037	u2927	m192	STYLES	And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
L535036	u2912	m192	1ST OFFICER	Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
L535028	u2927	m192	STYLES	Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
L535027	u2912	m192	1ST OFFICER	All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
L535026	u2927	m192	STYLES	Status!
L534663	u2931	m192	WOMAN	Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
L534662	u2913	m192	CAPTAIN	What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
L534648	u2913	m192	CAPTAIN	Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
L534647	u2931	m192	WOMAN	Put me on the hailing frequency.
L534646	u2913	m192	CAPTAIN	Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
L534645	u2931	m192	WOMAN	He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
L534644	u2913	m192	CAPTAIN	Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
L535160	u2918	m192	KIRK	Scotty...?
L535159	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
L535121	u2918	m192	KIRK	Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
L535120	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Nothing on my scanner, sir.
L535113	u2918	m192	KIRK	Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
L535112	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	For an instant... A scout class vessel.
L535111	u2918	m192	KIRK	What did you see, Chekov?
L535110	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
L535093	u2918	m192	KIRK	Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
L535092	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Still no response, sir.
L535084	u2918	m192	KIRK	Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
L535083	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
L535081	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Aye, sir.
L535080	u2918	m192	KIRK	What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
L535079	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Nothing. As before.
L535078	u2918	m192	KIRK	Response?
L535077	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
L535076	u2918	m192	KIRK	You did great, Bones... Just great.
L535041	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
L535040	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
L535019	u2918	m192	KIRK	No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
L535018	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
L535017	u2918	m192	KIRK	Calm yourself, Bones.
L534974	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
L534973	u2918	m192	KIRK	Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
L534875	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
L534874	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
L534788	u2918	m192	KIRK	I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
L534787	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Will we get another ship?
L534717	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
L534716	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
L534715	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	"An energy reading from 'C"" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters..."
L534714	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Chekov -- ?
L534912	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	On screen.
L534911	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
L534910	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Locate.
L534909	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
L534682	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
L534681	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
L534594	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
L534593	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Aye sir, coding now.
L534691	u2916	m192	DAVID	Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
L534690	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
L534685	u2916	m192	DAVID	Not from here, no.
L534684	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	"Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: ""nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated."" Can you guarantee that?"
L534683	u2916	m192	DAVID	Why don't we beam it up?
L534676	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	What is it?
L534675	u2916	m192	DAVID	I don't believe it...
L534613	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
L534612	u2916	m192	DAVID	It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
L534611	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Could it be Spock's?
L535199	u2916	m192	DAVID	I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
L535198	u2918	m192	KIRK	David, I don't understand...
L535197	u2916	m192	DAVID	I went wrong.
L535196	u2918	m192	KIRK	David!... What went wrong?
L535195	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
L535194	u2918	m192	KIRK	David... Sorry I'm late.
L535193	u2916	m192	DAVID	Hello, sir. It's David.
L535070	u2916	m192	DAVID	No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
L535069	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'll go...
L535068	u2916	m192	DAVID	Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
L535067	u2916	m192	DAVID	I still don't...
L535066	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
L535065	u2916	m192	DAVID	I don't understand.
L535064	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
L535063	u2916	m192	DAVID	Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
L535062	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... How long?
L535061	u2916	m192	DAVID	The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
L535060	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	And Spock with it. They are joined together.
L535059	u2916	m192	DAVID	This planet is aging in surges.
L534951	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
L534950	u2916	m192	DAVID	If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
L534949	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	So, like your father, you changed the rules...
L534948	u2916	m192	DAVID	My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
L534947	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Did your collaborator know?
L534946	u2916	m192	DAVID	It was the only way to solve certain problems --
L534945	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
L534944	u2916	m192	DAVID	I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
L534943	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Why?
L534942	u2916	m192	DAVID	Not exactly.
L534941	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
L534940	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I have already made one transmission too many...
L534939	u2916	m192	DAVID	Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
L534938	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	That may be difficult...
L534937	u2916	m192	DAVID	How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
L534936	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Logic indicates that is the case.
L534935	u2916	m192	DAVID	You mean, we're stranded down here?!
L534934	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
L534933	u2916	m192	DAVID	Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
L534849	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
L534848	u2916	m192	DAVID	Later. Let's go...
L534783	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Spock's burial robe.
L534782	u2916	m192	DAVID	What is it?
L534780	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
L534779	u2916	m192	DAVID	Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
L534778	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	David --
L534777	u2916	m192	DAVID	.          .. Spock's tube...
L534770	u2916	m192	DAVID	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
L534769	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	My readings indicate great instability.
L534768	u2916	m192	DAVID	I'll handle that later.
L534767	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
L534689	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Or <u>who</u>.
L534688	u2916	m192	DAVID	Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
L534680	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
L534679	u2916	m192	DAVID	There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
L534674	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
L534673	u2916	m192	DAVID	Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
L534672	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
L534671	u2916	m192	DAVID	Short range scan.
L534670	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
L534610	u2916	m192	DAVID	A photon tube...!
L534609	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
L534608	u2916	m192	DAVID	There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
L534607	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
L534606	u2916	m192	DAVID	Underground deposit?
L534605	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Same sector. Metallic mass.
L534604	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's a little early to celebrate.
L534603	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
L534602	u2916	m192	DAVID	All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
L534601	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Fascinating.
L534600	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
L534599	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
L534598	u2916	m192	DAVID	Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
L534597	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
L534596	u2916	m192	DAVID	This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
L534920	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
L534919	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, what's happening?!
L534907	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
L534906	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
L534905	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
L534904	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	None that I can detect, sir.
L534903	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
L534902	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
L534901	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
L534896	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
L534895	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
L534847	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Do you have an explanation?
L534846	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
L534845	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
L534776	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'll try to remember that, Captain.
L534775	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
L534774	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
L534773	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
L534687	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger. I know the book, Saavik.
L534686	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
L534678	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	You said there wouldn't be any.
L534677	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
L535294	u2918	m192	KIRK	Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
L535293	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Just him, sir!
L535292	u2918	m192	KIRK	How many more?
L535169	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
L535168	u2918	m192	KIRK	What's wrong?
L535167	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
L535166	u2918	m192	KIRK	I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
L535154	u2918	m192	KIRK	Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
L535153	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
L535152	u2918	m192	KIRK	Good shooting, Scotty.
L535146	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir!
L535145	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
L535143	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir!
L535142	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
L535074	u2918	m192	KIRK	Scan for vessels in pursuit!
L535073	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
L535032	u2918	m192	KIRK	The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
L535031	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Sir...?
L535030	u2918	m192	KIRK	Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
L535013	u2918	m192	KIRK	Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
L535012	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
L535011	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott?
L535008	u2918	m192	KIRK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
L535007	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
L534708	u2918	m192	KIRK	Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
L534707	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
L534706	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott...
L534631	u2918	m192	KIRK	Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
L534630	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
L534629	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
L534628	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
L534627	u2918	m192	KIRK	Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
L534626	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
L535332	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Much is at stake...
L535331	u2918	m192	KIRK	My God...
L535321	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	. He will remain always as he is.
L535320	u2918	m192	KIRK	And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
L535319	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
L535318	u2918	m192	KIRK	But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
L535317	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
L535316	u2918	m192	KIRK	What? What are you saying?
L535315	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
L535307	u2918	m192	KIRK	Goodbye, David.
L535306	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	The Genesis planet is gone.
L535268	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
L535267	u2918	m192	KIRK	Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
L535264	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
L535263	u2918	m192	KIRK	What happened...?
L535192	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
L535191	u2918	m192	KIRK	This Vulcan -- is he alive?
L535190	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
L535189	u2918	m192	KIRK	Saavik... Is... David with you?
L535188	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
L535362	u2918	m192	KIRK	You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
L535361	u2926	m192	SPOCK	The ship... Out of danger...?
L535360	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes, yes, Spock...
L535358	u2918	m192	KIRK	Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
L535357	u2926	m192	SPOCK	Why would you do this...?
L535356	u2918	m192	KIRK	You would have done the same for me.
L535355	u2926	m192	SPOCK	My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
L535354	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes. And I know you.
L535353	u2926	m192	SPOCK	I know you... Do I not?
L535329	u2928	m192	SULU	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
L535328	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
L535323	u2918	m192	KIRK	Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
L535322	u2928	m192	SULU	The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
L535309	u2918	m192	KIRK	Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
L535308	u2928	m192	SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
L535305	u2918	m192	KIRK	Go, Sulu!
L535304	u2928	m192	SULU	If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
L535246	u2918	m192	KIRK	Come on!
L535245	u2928	m192	SULU	Close... There --
L535244	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about surface life signs...?
L535243	u2928	m192	SULU	Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
L535214	u2918	m192	KIRK	With some on the planet...
L535213	u2928	m192	SULU	About a dozen officers and men.
L535212	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
L535151	u2918	m192	KIRK	Fire, Mr. Scott!
L535150	u2928	m192	SULU	Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
L535139	u2918	m192	KIRK	Red alert, Mr. Scott.
L535138	u2928	m192	SULU	... A cloaking device?
L535137	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
L535136	u2928	m192	SULU	I think it's an energy form, sir...
L535135	u2918	m192	KIRK	That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
L535131	u2928	m192	SULU	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
L535130	u2918	m192	KIRK	See! That shimmering area.
L535091	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
L535090	u2928	m192	SULU	We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
L535072	u2918	m192	KIRK	Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
L535071	u2928	m192	SULU	Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
L535050	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
L535049	u2928	m192	SULU	Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
L535045	u2928	m192	SULU	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
L535044	u2918	m192	KIRK	Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
L535035	u2918	m192	KIRK	FULL IMPULSE POWER!
L535034	u2928	m192	SULU	... We have cleared Spacedoors.
L534873	u2918	m192	KIRK	I'll need it, Sulu.
L534872	u2928	m192	SULU	Count on our help, sir.
L534871	u2918	m192	KIRK	The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
L534870	u2928	m192	SULU	The word, sir?
L534786	u2918	m192	KIRK	She's to be decommissioned.
L534785	u2928	m192	SULU	... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
L534621	u2918	m192	KIRK	Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
L534620	u2928	m192	SULU	On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
L535006	u2930	m192	UHURA	"Oh, I'll have ""Mr. Adventure"" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes."
L535005	u2918	m192	KIRK	Will you be able to handle that...?
L534995	u2930	m192	UHURA	Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
L534994	u2918	m192	KIRK	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
L534993	u2930	m192	UHURA	Gentlemen. Good evening.
L534790	u2918	m192	KIRK	That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
L534789	u2930	m192	UHURA	How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
L534703	u2918	m192	KIRK	My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
L534702	u2930	m192	UHURA	Would you look at that?
L534694	u2930	m192	UHURA	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
L534693	u2918	m192	KIRK	Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
L534625	u2918	m192	KIRK	Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
L534624	u2930	m192	UHURA	No, sir, no response.
L534623	u2918	m192	KIRK	Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
L534869	u2922	m192	MORROW	Any time.
L534868	u2918	m192	KIRK	You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
L534867	u2922	m192	MORROW	Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
L534866	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
L534864	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
L534863	u2922	m192	MORROW	Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
L534862	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
L534861	u2922	m192	MORROW	No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
L534860	u2918	m192	KIRK	As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
L534859	u2922	m192	MORROW	Yours...?!
L534858	u2918	m192	KIRK	Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
L534857	u2922	m192	MORROW	Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
L534856	u2918	m192	KIRK	Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
L534855	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
L534747	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
L534746	u2918	m192	KIRK	May I ask why...?
L534745	u2922	m192	MORROW	That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
L534744	u2918	m192	KIRK	Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
L534743	u2922	m192	MORROW	Genesis?! Whatever for?
L534742	u2918	m192	KIRK	But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
L534741	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
L534740	u2918	m192	KIRK	Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
L534734	u2922	m192	MORROW	Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
L534733	u2918	m192	KIRK	Indisposed, sir.
L534732	u2922	m192	MORROW	Where's Doctor McCoy?
L534728	u2922	m192	MORROW	Welcome home, Jim.
L534727	u2918	m192	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Admiral.
L535289	u2918	m192	KIRK	Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
L535287	u2918	m192	KIRK	Give me your hand and we both live.
L535285	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
L535284	u2918	m192	KIRK	If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
L535283	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
L535282	u2918	m192	KIRK	You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
L535281	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
L535280	u2918	m192	KIRK	Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
L535279	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Genesis, I want it.
L535278	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Because you wish it.  
L535277	u2918	m192	KIRK	But, why?
L535276	u2919	m192	KRUGE	No.
L535275	u2918	m192	KIRK	You should take the Vulcan, too.
L535274	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
L535219	u2918	m192	KIRK	No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
L535218	u2919	m192	KRUGE	No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
L535217	u2918	m192	KIRK	Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
L535208	u2918	m192	KIRK	All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
L535207	u2919	m192	KRUGE	There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
L535202	u2918	m192	KIRK	Wait! Give me a chance --
L535201	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
L535200	u2918	m192	KIRK	David?... David!
L535187	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
L535186	u2918	m192	KIRK	Who is this?! How dare you --
L535185	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
L535164	u2918	m192	KIRK	Torpedoes coming in -- !
L535117	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Report status!
L535116	u2918	m192	KIRK	I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
L535352	u2918	m192	KIRK	If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
L535351	u2924	m192	SAREK	But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
L535350	u2918	m192	KIRK	What I have done, I had to do.
L535349	u2924	m192	SAREK	I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
L535348	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about Spock?
L534842	u2924	m192	SAREK	You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
L534841	u2918	m192	KIRK	What you ask is difficult.
L534840	u2924	m192	SAREK	You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
L534839	u2918	m192	KIRK	What must I do?
L534838	u2924	m192	SAREK	One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
L534837	u2918	m192	KIRK	Bones!...
L534826	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
L534825	u2924	m192	SAREK	Yes... But -- how...?
L534824	u2918	m192	KIRK	Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
L534823	u2924	m192	SAREK	I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
L534822	u2918	m192	KIRK	But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
L534821	u2924	m192	SAREK	Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
L534820	u2918	m192	KIRK	... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
L534819	u2924	m192	SAREK	I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
L534818	u2918	m192	KIRK	... Spock...
L534817	u2924	m192	SAREK	... Or the one.
L534816	u2918	m192	KIRK	... The needs of the few...
L534815	u2924	m192	SAREK	... The needs of the many outweigh...
L534814	u2918	m192	KIRK	... Yes...
L534813	u2924	m192	SAREK	He asked you not to grieve...
L534812	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes...
L534811	u2924	m192	SAREK	... He spoke of your friendship.
L534810	u2918	m192	KIRK	Of course...!
L534809	u2924	m192	SAREK	Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
L534808	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then, how --
L534807	u2924	m192	SAREK	He would not have spoken of it openly.
L534806	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
L534805	u2924	m192	SAREK	Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
L534804	u2918	m192	KIRK	But -- why?
L534803	u2924	m192	SAREK	Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
L534802	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes, I was...
L534801	u2924	m192	SAREK	"You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was ""in death,"" Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him."
L534800	u2918	m192	KIRK	I -- saw no future --
L534799	u2924	m192	SAREK	Met his death?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
L534798	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
L534797	u2924	m192	SAREK	Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
L534796	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
L534794	u2924	m192	SAREK	I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
L534793	u2918	m192	KIRK	Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
L535211	u2919	m192	KRUGE	<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
L535210	u2929	m192	TORG	They outnumber us, my Lord --
L535209	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
L535184	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
L535183	u2929	m192	TORG	How can you tell that?
L535176	u2919	m192	KRUGE	They know we would die first.
L535175	u2929	m192	TORG	Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
L535174	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
L535119	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
L535118	u2929	m192	TORG	We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
L535108	u2929	m192	TORG	But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
L535107	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I ordered no interruptions.
L534930	u2929	m192	TORG	I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
L534929	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
L534928	u2929	m192	TORG	Sir, may I suggest --
L534761	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Station!
L534760	u2929	m192	TORG	Success, my lord.
L534759	u2919	m192	KRUGE	"We are going to this ""planet."" Even as our emissaries negotiate for ""peace"" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!"
L534758	u2929	m192	TORG	Understood, my lord.
L534757	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Share this with no one.
L534750	u2929	m192	TORG	Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
L534749	u2919	m192	KRUGE	So!  Speak!
L535254	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
L535253	u2921	m192	MALTZ	But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
L535252	u2919	m192	KRUGE	They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
L535251	u2921	m192	MALTZ	We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
L535250	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
L535249	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Sir, may I --
L535248	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
L535247	u2921	m192	MALTZ	My Lord... what are your orders?
L535178	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Put him on screen!  Study him well.
L535177	u2921	m192	MALTZ	My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
L535147	u2921	m192	MALTZ	500 Kellicams!
L535141	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Wait!... Wait...
L535140	u2921	m192	MALTZ	1,000 Kellicams, closing!
L535132	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Firing range, sir.
L535123	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Steady. Continue on impulse power.
L535122	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Range: 3000 Kellicams.
L534668	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Yes, my lord!
L534667	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
L535003	u2930	m192	UHURA	This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
L535002	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
L535001	u2930	m192	UHURA	I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
L535000	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
L534999	u2930	m192	UHURA	All true.
L534998	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
L534997	u2930	m192	UHURA	Good for you, Lieutenant.
L534996	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
L534992	u2930	m192	UHURA	You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
L534991	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
L534990	u2930	m192	UHURA	Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
L534989	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
L534988	u2930	m192	UHURA	How is that...?
L534987	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	You amaze me, Commander.
L534505	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
L534504	u2932	m193	BONES	You're not going in there -- !
L534503	u2943	m193	SPOCK	But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
L534502	u2932	m193	BONES	Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
L534064	u2932	m193	BONES	Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
L534063	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
L534062	u2932	m193	BONES	Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
L534061	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
L534060	u2932	m193	BONES	It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
L534059	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
L534058	u2932	m193	BONES	But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
L534582	u2938	m193	KIRK	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
L534581	u2932	m193	BONES	You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
L534401	u2932	m193	BONES	I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
L534400	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
L534388	u2938	m193	KIRK	We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
L534387	u2932	m193	BONES	Until now.
L534381	u2938	m193	KIRK	And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
L534380	u2932	m193	BONES	Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
L534372	u2932	m193	BONES	It's like the Garden of Eden...
L534371	u2938	m193	KIRK	Now that's what I call a meal.
L534336	u2938	m193	KIRK	Our first order of business is survival.
L534335	u2932	m193	BONES	How can you think of food at a time like this?
L534334	u2938	m193	KIRK	Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
L534272	u2938	m193	KIRK	Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
L534271	u2932	m193	BONES	But what if they went -- nowhere?
L534270	u2938	m193	KIRK	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
L534269	u2932	m193	BONES	Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
L534224	u2932	m193	BONES	This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
L534223	u2938	m193	KIRK	They even killed the galley chief.
L534213	u2932	m193	BONES	I can spare me...
L534212	u2938	m193	KIRK	He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
L534211	u2932	m193	BONES	Khan could be down there!
L534194	u2938	m193	KIRK	I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
L534193	u2932	m193	BONES	There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
L534192	u2938	m193	KIRK	At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
L534191	u2932	m193	BONES	Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
L534040	u2938	m193	KIRK	Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
L534039	u2932	m193	BONES	I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
L533983	u2938	m193	KIRK	As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
L533982	u2932	m193	BONES	It never rains but when it pours --
L533886	u2938	m193	KIRK	The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
L533885	u2932	m193	BONES	What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
L533861	u2938	m193	KIRK	Ah.
L533860	u2932	m193	BONES	Shore leave, Admiral.
L533791	u2932	m193	BONES	I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
L533790	u2938	m193	KIRK	Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
L533789	u2932	m193	BONES	From yourself, Admiral.
L533788	u2938	m193	KIRK	And who am I hiding from?
L533787	u2932	m193	BONES	Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
L533786	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
L533785	u2932	m193	BONES	What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
L533784	u2938	m193	KIRK	Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
L533783	u2932	m193	BONES	Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
L533782	u2938	m193	KIRK	Thank you.
L533781	u2932	m193	BONES	Say thank you.
L533780	u2938	m193	KIRK	Amazing! I don't know what to say --
L533779	u2932	m193	BONES	Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
L533778	u2932	m193	BONES	Exactly. Happy birthday.
L533777	u2938	m193	KIRK	But I'm allergic to Retlax.
L533776	u2932	m193	BONES	For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
L533775	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh -- what are they?
L533774	u2932	m193	BONES	Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
L533773	u2938	m193	KIRK	Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
L533772	u2932	m193	BONES	More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
L533771	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
L533769	u2932	m193	BONES	Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
L533768	u2938	m193	KIRK	Twenty-two, eighty-three...
L533767	u2932	m193	BONES	I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
L533766	u2938	m193	KIRK	Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
L533765	u2932	m193	BONES	'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
L533764	u2938	m193	KIRK	Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
L533717	u2938	m193	KIRK	They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
L533716	u2932	m193	BONES	Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
L533704	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm not a drama critic.
L533703	u2932	m193	BONES	That's all you have to say?
L533702	u2938	m193	KIRK	Physician, heal thyself.
L533939	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
L533938	u2933	m193	CAROL	This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
L533934	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I have my orders.
L533933	u2933	m193	CAROL	But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
L533932	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
L533931	u2933	m193	CAROL	<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
L533930	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
L533929	u2933	m193	CAROL	I still don't under --
L533928	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
L533927	u2933	m193	CAROL	En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
L533926	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
L533925	u2933	m193	CAROL	Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
L533924	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
L534580	u2938	m193	KIRK	Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
L534579	u2933	m193	CAROL	Is that a poem?
L534578	u2938	m193	KIRK	It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
L534358	u2933	m193	CAROL	The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
L534357	u2938	m193	KIRK	You did this -- in a day?!
L534349	u2933	m193	CAROL	How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
L534348	u2938	m193	KIRK	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
L534347	u2933	m193	CAROL	David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
L534049	u2933	m193	CAROL	Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
L534048	u2938	m193	KIRK	Wait --
L533997	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim please --
L533996	u2938	m193	KIRK	Carol!
L533995	u2933	m193	CAROL	... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
L533994	u2938	m193	KIRK	What order? Who's taking Genesis?
L533993	u2933	m193	CAROL	... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
L533992	u2938	m193	KIRK	Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
L533991	u2933	m193	CAROL	... taking Genesis away from us...
L533990	u2938	m193	KIRK	Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
L533989	u2933	m193	CAROL	... Can't read you... repeat...
L533988	u2938	m193	KIRK	Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
L533987	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim... read me? Can you read me?
L534343	u2935	m193	DAVID	This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
L534342	u2933	m193	CAROL	David. Please.
L534340	u2935	m193	DAVID	But we can't just sit here -- !
L534339	u2933	m193	CAROL	This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
L534328	u2933	m193	CAROL	I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
L534327	u2935	m193	DAVID	So are we, it looks like.
L534285	u2933	m193	CAROL	You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
L534284	u2935	m193	DAVID	Go back. I'm going to kill him.
L534283	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim --
L534282	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mother, go back!
L534281	u2933	m193	CAROL	David --
L533948	u2933	m193	CAROL	Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
L533947	u2935	m193	DAVID	I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
L533944	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
L533943	u2933	m193	CAROL	Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
L533921	u2935	m193	DAVID	Who --
L533920	u2933	m193	CAROL	I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
L533919	u2935	m193	DAVID	Does that about do it?
L533761	u2935	m193	DAVID	Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
L533760	u2933	m193	CAROL	Maybe...
L533759	u2935	m193	DAVID	Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
L533758	u2933	m193	CAROL	Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
L533757	u2935	m193	DAVID	Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
L533756	u2933	m193	CAROL	I know, I know...
L533755	u2935	m193	DAVID	Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
L533754	u2933	m193	CAROL	And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
L533753	u2935	m193	DAVID	How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
L534249	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
L534248	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
L533818	u2946	m193	TERRELL	What do you want with us? I demand --
L533817	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
L533810	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Never mind! Hurry!
L533809	u2946	m193	TERRELL	But the child --
L533807	u2946	m193	TERRELL	What's the matter -- ?
L533806	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
L533805	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Ssssh!
L533804	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I told you! I told you I saw a --
L533801	u2946	m193	TERRELL	There's an air-lock.
L533800	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I saw it -- !
L533799	u2946	m193	TERRELL	You're crazy -- !
L533794	u2946	m193	TERRELL	I can hardly see --
L533793	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
L533792	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Are you sure these are the coordinates?
L533748	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You know what she'll say...
L533747	u2946	m193	TERRELL	All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
L533746	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
L533745	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
L533744	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
L533743	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Don't tell me you've got something.
L533942	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
L533941	u2937	m193	KHAN	Well done, Commander.
L533915	u2937	m193	KHAN	I see. Helmsman?
L533914	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
L533913	u2937	m193	KHAN	Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
L533912	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
L533911	u2937	m193	KHAN	Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
L533910	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
L533835	u2937	m193	KHAN	There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
L533834	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
L533827	u2937	m193	KHAN	And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
L533826	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
L533825	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
L533824	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
L534567	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
L534566	u2938	m193	KIRK	Is that what you came here to say?
L534565	u2935	m193	DAVID	I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
L534564	u2938	m193	KIRK	I am truly sorry.
L534563	u2935	m193	DAVID	So am I. My friends were killed, too.
L534562	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm trying, David.
L534561	u2935	m193	DAVID	But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
L534560	u2938	m193	KIRK	It was just words.
L534559	u2935	m193	DAVID	You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
L534558	u2938	m193	KIRK	Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
L534557	u2935	m193	DAVID	That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
L534556	u2938	m193	KIRK	I didn't expect anything.
L534555	u2935	m193	DAVID	No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
L534554	u2938	m193	KIRK	I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
L534553	u2935	m193	DAVID	Are you running away from me?
L534552	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
L534551	u2935	m193	DAVID	I don't mean to intrude.
L534496	u2935	m193	DAVID	You can't!
L534495	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll beam aboard and stop it --
L534494	u2935	m193	DAVID	We encoded four minutes --
L534493	u2938	m193	KIRK	How soon --
L534492	u2935	m193	DAVID	He's on a build up to detonation!
L534491	u2938	m193	KIRK	What?
L534490	u2935	m193	DAVID	It's the Genesis Wave!
L534330	u2935	m193	DAVID	We appear to have plenty of time.
L534329	u2938	m193	KIRK	It's a long story.
L534290	u2935	m193	DAVID	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
L534289	u2938	m193	KIRK	Why didn't you tell me?
L534280	u2935	m193	DAVID	I'm Doctor Marcus!
L534279	u2938	m193	KIRK	Where's Dr. Marcus --
L534278	u2935	m193	DAVID	<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
L534277	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm Admiral Kirk...
L534370	u2935	m193	DAVID	I don't know.
L534369	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	What are <u>you</u> looking at?
L534368	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Oh, I believe it.
L534367	u2935	m193	DAVID	Don't you believe it.
L534366	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	The Admiral's son.
L534365	u2935	m193	DAVID	What are you looking at?
L534313	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Only half of you would get there.
L534312	u2935	m193	DAVID	Let go -- he can't -- !
L534462	u2937	m193	KHAN	I shall avenge you --
L534461	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Yours... is... the superior...
L534451	u2937	m193	KHAN	Raise the shields...
L534450	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Inoperative.
L534449	u2937	m193	KHAN	Tactical!
L534446	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>Full power damn you</u>!
L534445	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
L534426	u2937	m193	KHAN	Rake her.
L534425	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	We'll lose them if they go in there.
L534363	u2937	m193	KHAN	Visual --
L534362	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Departing dark side, Regula.
L534320	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
L534319	u2937	m193	KHAN	Well?
L534172	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
L534171	u2937	m193	KHAN	No!
L534170	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
L534169	u2937	m193	KHAN	At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
L534167	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
L534166	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They won't --
L534165	u2937	m193	KHAN	Raise them --
L534164	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Sir -- our shields are dropping!
L534099	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Locking phasers on target.
L534098	u2937	m193	KHAN	Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
L534086	u2937	m193	KHAN	Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
L534085	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They're still running with shields down.
L534084	u2937	m193	KHAN	Let them eat static.
L534083	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They're requesting visual communications, sir.
L533909	u2937	m193	KHAN	It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
L533908	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Steady on course. All systems normal.
L534318	u2938	m193	KIRK	KHAN!
L534317	u2937	m193	KHAN	Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
L534311	u2937	m193	KHAN	Perhaps I no longer need to try.
L534310	u2938	m193	KIRK	Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
L534309	u2937	m193	KHAN	Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
L534163	u2938	m193	KIRK	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
L534162	u2937	m193	KHAN	Time's up, Admiral...
L534159	u2938	m193	KIRK	I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
L534158	u2937	m193	KHAN	I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
L534157	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
L534154	u2938	m193	KIRK	... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
L534153	u2937	m193	KHAN	Thirty seconds...
L534140	u2937	m193	KHAN	I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
L534139	u2938	m193	KIRK	Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
L534138	u2937	m193	KHAN	Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
L534137	u2938	m193	KIRK	Genesis, what's that?
L534135	u2937	m193	KHAN	That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
L534134	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
L534133	u2937	m193	KHAN	-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
L534132	u2937	m193	KHAN	Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
L534131	u2938	m193	KIRK	What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
L534130	u2937	m193	KHAN	You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
L534302	u2937	m193	KHAN	First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
L534301	u2946	m193	TERRELL	All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
L534300	u2937	m193	KHAN	Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
L533823	u2937	m193	KHAN	Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
L533822	u2946	m193	TERRELL	I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
L533821	u2937	m193	KHAN	Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
L533820	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Listen to me -- you men and women --
L533819	u2937	m193	KHAN	You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
L533816	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Chekov, who is this man?
L533815	u2937	m193	KHAN	I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
L534482	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
L534481	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
L534210	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm going down to the station.
L534209	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just barely, sir.
L534121	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	A few shots, sir.
L534120	u2938	m193	KIRK	We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
L534119	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
L534118	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty -- what's left?
L534006	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir --
L534005	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll be going to warp speed --
L534004	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir.
L534003	u2938	m193	KIRK	An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
L534488	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
L534487	u2947	m193	UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
L534231	u2947	m193	UHURA	I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
L534230	u2938	m193	KIRK	Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
L534200	u2938	m193	KIRK	Sensors, Captain?
L534199	u2947	m193	UHURA	... No response, sir.
L534127	u2938	m193	KIRK	Do it, while we have time.
L534126	u2947	m193	UHURA	Admiral --
L534125	u2938	m193	KIRK	On screen.
L534110	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty, let's have it.
L534109	u2947	m193	UHURA	Mr. Scott on discrete.
L534095	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock?
L534094	u2947	m193	UHURA	I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
L534076	u2938	m193	KIRK	Picture, Mr. Saavik.
L534075	u2947	m193	UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
L534074	u2938	m193	KIRK	Try the emergency channels...
L534073	u2947	m193	UHURA	She's not responding...
L533986	u2947	m193	UHURA	I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
L533985	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura. Can't you augment?
L534524	u2938	m193	KIRK	He'll die -- !
L534523	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
L534465	u2938	m193	KIRK	All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
L534464	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
L534414	u2938	m193	KIRK	No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
L534413	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
L534180	u2938	m193	KIRK	He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
L534179	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	<u>WHY</u>?
L533884	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Aye, sir.
L533883	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, the word is given.
L533882	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Give the word, Admiral.
L533881	u2938	m193	KIRK	Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
L533880	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
L533879	u2938	m193	KIRK	Midshipman, you're a tiger.
L533859	u2938	m193	KIRK	Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
L533858	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
L533857	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
L534390	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
L534389	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
L534263	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Not at present.
L534262	u2938	m193	KIRK	Meaning you can't even beam us back?
L534260	u2938	m193	KIRK	I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
L534259	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
L534258	u2938	m193	KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
L534187	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
L534186	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
L534185	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, Spock.
L534184	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, this is Spock.
L534183	u2938	m193	KIRK	If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
L534178	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Aye...
L534177	u2938	m193	KIRK	The word is given: warp speed.
L534176	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Is the word given?
L533877	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
L533876	u2938	m193	KIRK	Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
L533875	u2939	m193	PRESTON	I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
L533866	u2938	m193	KIRK	I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
L533865	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Yes, SIR.
L533864	u2938	m193	KIRK	Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
L533863	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
L533862	u2938	m193	KIRK	And who is this?
L534535	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
L534534	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock...!
L534533	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
L534532	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Or the one.
L534531	u2938	m193	KIRK	... the good of the few...
L534529	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes --
L534528	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The ship -- out of danger?
L534527	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock!
L534471	u2943	m193	SPOCK	He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
L534470	u2938	m193	KIRK	He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
L534469	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
L534437	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, patch me in --
L534436	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Admiral, they're reducing speed.
L534424	u2938	m193	KIRK	Steady as you go...
L534423	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
L534421	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best speed, Scotty...
L534420	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
L534412	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty, can we make it inside?
L534411	u2943	m193	SPOCK	She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
L534410	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh oh.
L534406	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Best we could do in two hours.
L534405	u2938	m193	KIRK	That's it?
L534404	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
L534403	u2938	m193	KIRK	What IS working around here?
L534219	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Be careful, Jim...
L534218	u2938	m193	KIRK	Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
L534217	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Aye sir --
L534216	u2938	m193	KIRK	All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
L534208	u2938	m193	KIRK	Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
L534207	u2943	m193	SPOCK	A distinct possibility.
L534206	u2938	m193	KIRK	Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
L534205	u2943	m193	SPOCK	"Regula is class ""D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space."
L534204	u2938	m193	KIRK	... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
L534203	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Affirmative, Admiral.
L534202	u2938	m193	KIRK	And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
L534201	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
L534156	u2938	m193	KIRK	Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
L534155	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
L534152	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
L534151	u2938	m193	KIRK	You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
L534146	u2938	m193	KIRK	It's all we've got.
L534145	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The prefix code?
L534142	u2938	m193	KIRK	At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
L534141	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
L534123	u2938	m193	KIRK	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
L534122	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Not enough against their shields.
L534116	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Too late --
L534115	u2938	m193	KIRK	Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
L534114	u2943	m193	SPOCK	One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
L534113	u2938	m193	KIRK	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
L534112	u2943	m193	SPOCK	They knew just where to hit us.
L534101	u2938	m193	KIRK	Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
L534100	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
L534080	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It would explain a great many things --
L534079	u2938	m193	KIRK	Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
L534072	u2938	m193	KIRK	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
L534071	u2943	m193	SPOCK	What's she doing here?
L534066	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
L534065	u2938	m193	KIRK	Gentlemen, this isn't --
L534057	u2938	m193	KIRK	The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
L534056	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Have they proceeded with their experiments?
L534055	u2938	m193	KIRK	The power of creation --
L534054	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It literally is Genesis...
L534045	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes.
L534044	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Carol Marcus --
L534037	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
L534036	u2938	m193	KIRK	Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
L534035	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
L534034	u2938	m193	KIRK	How far?
L534033	u2943	m193	SPOCK	There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
L534028	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
L534027	u2938	m193	KIRK	Will you accompany me to the bridge?
L534025	u2938	m193	KIRK	Or the one.
L534024	u2943	m193	SPOCK	That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
L534023	u2938	m193	KIRK	I would not presume to debate you.
L534022	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
L534021	u2938	m193	KIRK	You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
L534020	u2943	m193	SPOCK	You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
L534019	u2938	m193	KIRK	But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
L534018	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
L534017	u2938	m193	KIRK	That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
L534016	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
L534015	u2938	m193	KIRK	I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
L534014	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
L534013	u2938	m193	KIRK	Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
L533898	u2938	m193	KIRK	To be sure, Captain.
L533897	u2943	m193	SPOCK	There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
L533856	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, we've been through death and life together.
L533855	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
L533854	u2938	m193	KIRK	Permission to come aboard, Captain?
L533734	u2938	m193	KIRK	Home.
L533733	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
L533732	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
L533731	u2943	m193	SPOCK	None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
L533730	u2938	m193	KIRK	'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
L533729	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I know of your fondness for antiques.
L533728	u2938	m193	KIRK	Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
L533727	u2943	m193	SPOCK	She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
L533726	u2938	m193	KIRK	So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot?g?'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
L533725	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
L533724	u2938	m193	KIRK	It had the virtue of never having been tried.
L533723	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
L533722	u2938	m193	KIRK	They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
L533721	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I am understandably curious.
L533720	u2938	m193	KIRK	I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
L534266	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
L534265	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
L534264	u2938	m193	KIRK	Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
L534000	u2938	m193	KIRK	Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
L533999	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
L533998	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
L533981	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Yes, sir.
L533980	u2938	m193	KIRK	In my quarters, Uhura.
L533979	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
L533978	u2938	m193	KIRK	Kirk here.
L534573	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir --
L534572	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
L534571	u2938	m193	KIRK	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
L534570	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
L534569	u2938	m193	KIRK	As you were, Mr. Saavik.
L534568	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Admiral on the bridge!
L534549	u2938	m193	KIRK	Dismiss the company.
L534548	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Understood, sir.
L534547	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
L534546	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534545	u2938	m193	KIRK	After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
L534515	u2938	m193	KIRK	Distance from Reliant...
L534514	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
L534513	u2938	m193	KIRK	Time!
L534509	u2938	m193	KIRK	Engine room! What's happening?!
L534508	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Two minutes, ten seconds.
L534507	u2938	m193	KIRK	Time from my mark...
L534500	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534499	u2938	m193	KIRK	Saavik, get us out, best speed!
L534480	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
L534479	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Power levels quite low, sir.
L534478	u2938	m193	KIRK	Cease fire. Look sharp.
L534474	u2938	m193	KIRK	Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
L534473	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	All stop, sir.
L534472	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Saavik, all stop.
L534457	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	At what.
L534456	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hold your course. Look sharp...
L534434	u2938	m193	KIRK	They just don't want us going in there.
L534433	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	That was close --
L534397	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
L534396	u2938	m193	KIRK	Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
L534393	u2938	m193	KIRK	Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
L534392	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
L534386	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
L534385	u2938	m193	KIRK	I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
L534384	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	<u>WHAT</u>?
L534383	u2938	m193	KIRK	I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
L534382	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	How?
L534379	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
L534378	u2938	m193	KIRK	Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
L534375	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
L534374	u2938	m193	KIRK	What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
L534345	u2938	m193	KIRK	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
L534344	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Admiral?
L534257	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Stage Two of what?
L534256	u2938	m193	KIRK	If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
L534255	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
L534245	u2938	m193	KIRK	Erased...
L534244	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
L534222	u2938	m193	KIRK	Phasers on stun. Move out.
L534221	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Indeterminate life signs.
L534215	u2938	m193	KIRK	There is no such regulation.

L534148	u2938	m193	KIRK	We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
L534147	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	On screen...
L534144	u2938	m193	KIRK	HURRY.
L534143	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Reliant's command...
L534129	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Who?
L534128	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan!
L534093	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Energize defense fields.
L534092	u2938	m193	KIRK	This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
L533972	u2938	m193	KIRK	Take the test again.
L533971	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Yes.
L533969	u2938	m193	KIRK	We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
L533968	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
L533967	u2938	m193	KIRK	That was a little joke.
L533966	u2938	m193	KIRK	You may ask, Lieutenant.
L533965	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
L533964	u2938	m193	KIRK	There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
L533963	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I failed to resolve the situation.
L533962	u2938	m193	KIRK	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
L533961	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I did not think so.
L533960	u2938	m193	KIRK	You earned it.
L533959	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
L533958	u2938	m193	KIRK	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
L533957	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	May I speak, sir?
L533956	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	It is still regulation, Admiral.
L533955	u2938	m193	KIRK	Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
L533715	u2938	m193	KIRK	Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
L533714	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
L533713	u2938	m193	KIRK	How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
L533712	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	... No, sir. It has not.
L533711	u2938	m193	KIRK	A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
L533710	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Because... there was no way to win.
L533709	u2938	m193	KIRK	And why not?
L533708	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
L533707	u2938	m193	KIRK	Very well.
L533706	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Permission to speak candidly, sir?
L533705	u2938	m193	KIRK	Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
L533700	u2938	m193	KIRK	Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
L533699	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Any suggestions, Admiral?
L534454	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.

L534174	u2938	m193	KIRK	<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
L534173	u2945	m193	SULU	Sir, you did it.
L534161	u2945	m193	SULU	Phasers locked...
L534160	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...

L534002	u2945	m193	SULU	Stop engines.
L534001	u2938	m193	KIRK	Stop engines.
L533850	u2938	m193	KIRK	You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
L533849	u2945	m193	SULU	Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
L533848	u2938	m193	KIRK	I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
L533847	u2945	m193	SULU	I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
L533846	u2938	m193	KIRK	I really must thank you.
L534542	u2945	m193	SULU	Honors -- hup!
L534541	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
L534010	u2945	m193	SULU	Ready, sir.
L534009	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Prepare for warp speed.
L533905	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Course heading, Captain?
L533904	u2945	m193	SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
L533900	u2945	m193	SULU	Aft thrusters, sir.
L533899	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
L533685	u2945	m193	SULU	I'll try, Captain.
L533684	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
L533681	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
L533680	u2945	m193	SULU	Shields activated!
L533672	u2945	m193	SULU	... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
L533671	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
L533670	u2945	m193	SULU	May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
L533655	u2945	m193	SULU	Aye, Captain.
L533654	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
L533653	u2945	m193	SULU	Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
L534399	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I exaggerated.
L534398	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	You lied.
L534395	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	By the book...
L534394	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Certainly...
L534091	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534090	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
L534089	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
L533896	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L533895	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
L533894	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Never, sir.
L533893	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
L533892	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
L533891	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	All moorings are clear, Captain.
L533890	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L533889	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
L533873	u2943	m193	SPOCK	We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
L533872	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	He's very human.
L533871	u2943	m193	SPOCK	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
L533870	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	He's not what I expected, Sir.
L533695	u2943	m193	SPOCK	No power to the weapons system, sir.
L533694	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Fire all phasers...!
L535439	u2949	m194	AMANDA	... They do, indeed.
L535438	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Humans make illogical decisions...
L535437	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
L535436	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I would accept that as an axiom.
L535435	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
L535434	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I do this because I was there,
L535433	u2949	m194	AMANDA	You do this -- for friendship?
L535432	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To Earth. To offer testimony.
L535431	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Where must you go?
L535430	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
L535429	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
L535428	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The question is irrelevant.
L535427	u2949	m194	AMANDA	You are half human. The Computer knows that.
L535426	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I do not understand the final question...
L536022	u2950	m194	BOB	Gillian --
L536021	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
L535774	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Why don't I?
L535773	u2950	m194	BOB	Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
L535772	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
L535771	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
L535770	u2950	m194	BOB	And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
L535769	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Yeah.
L535768	u2950	m194	BOB	I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
L535767	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Bob... it's tearing me apart.
L535766	u2950	m194	BOB	Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
L535765	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Fine. Just fine.
L535764	u2950	m194	BOB	How're you doing?
L535763	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Just a couple of kooks...
L535762	u2950	m194	BOB	Heard there was some excitement.
L535880	u2951	m194	BONES	A moment alone, please.
L535879	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
L535869	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Please...
L535868	u2951	m194	BONES	He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
L535859	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
L535858	u2951	m194	BONES	Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
L535857	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
L535836	u2951	m194	BONES	I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
L535835	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
L536268	u2958	m194	KIRK	Not me, Bones... They did it.
L536267	u2951	m194	BONES	Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
L536105	u2958	m194	KIRK	Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
L536104	u2951	m194	BONES	He's coming 'round, Jim...
L536103	u2958	m194	KIRK	Come on, Pavel...
L536102	u2951	m194	BONES	Wake up, man, wake up!
L536090	u2951	m194	BONES	Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
L536089	u2958	m194	KIRK	An experimental device, doctor.
L536082	u2951	m194	BONES	Cramps.
L536081	u2958	m194	KIRK	What did you say she was getting?
L536057	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you think, Spock?
L536056	u2951	m194	BONES	Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
L535649	u2958	m194	KIRK	Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
L535648	u2951	m194	BONES	Oh, joy.
L535643	u2958	m194	KIRK	Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
L535642	u2951	m194	BONES	It doesn't look all that different.
L535572	u2958	m194	KIRK	If you have a better idea - now's the time.
L535571	u2951	m194	BONES	That's crazy!
L535570	u2958	m194	KIRK	-- That's the general idea.
L535569	u2951	m194	BONES	I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
L535568	u2958	m194	KIRK	Would you prefer to do nothing?
L535567	u2951	m194	BONES	Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
L535566	u2958	m194	KIRK	We've done it before.
L535565	u2951	m194	BONES	You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
L535551	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
L535550	u2951	m194	BONES	Now wait just a damn minute.
L535530	u2951	m194	BONES	No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
L535529	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bones, stay here.
L535518	u2951	m194	BONES	Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
L535517	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bones --
L535478	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
L535477	u2951	m194	BONES	Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
L535476	u2958	m194	KIRK	It'll come back to him.
L535475	u2951	m194	BONES	I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
L535474	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you mean?
L535473	u2951	m194	BONES	You sure this is such a bright idea?
L535417	u2951	m194	BONES	I just wish we could cloak the stench.
L535416	u2958	m194	KIRK	We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
L535415	u2951	m194	BONES	You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
L536211	u2951	m194	BONES	It is.
L536210	u2967	m194	SPOCK	You're saying... It is a compliment.
L536209	u2951	m194	BONES	"No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your ""guesses"" than most other peoples facts."
L536208	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... I don't think he understands...
L536163	u2951	m194	BONES	Well nobody's perfect...
L536162	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Guessing is not in my nature...
L536161	u2951	m194	BONES	Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
L536160	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... Best shot...?
L536159	u2951	m194	BONES	Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
L536158	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Acceleration is no longer a constant.
L536157	u2951	m194	BONES	Naturally.  So what is your problem?
L536156	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
L536155	u2951	m194	BONES	You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
L535593	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
L535592	u2951	m194	BONES	Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
L535549	u2951	m194	BONES	Then how.?
L535548	u2967	m194	SPOCK	That is what I said, Doctor.
L535547	u2951	m194	BONES	You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
L535538	u2951	m194	BONES	... My God...
L535537	u2967	m194	SPOCK	10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
L535535	u2951	m194	BONES	That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
L535534	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Specifically, Humpback Whales.
L535516	u2951	m194	BONES	I liked him better before he died.
L535515	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
L535514	u2951	m194	BONES	"Really? You think this is its way of saying ""Hi there"" to the people of the Earth?"
L535513	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
L535507	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
L535506	u2951	m194	BONES	You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
L535505	u2967	m194	SPOCK	A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
L535504	u2951	m194	BONES	You're joking...!
L535503	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
L535502	u2951	m194	BONES	Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
L535501	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
L535500	u2951	m194	BONES	Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
L535499	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... My shoes...
L535498	u2951	m194	BONES	Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
L535497	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
L535496	u2951	m194	BONES	Hi... Busy?
L536096	u2951	m194	BONES	My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
L536095	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
L536094	u2951	m194	BONES	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
L536093	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	Fundoscopic examination --
L536092	u2951	m194	BONES	How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
L536091	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	What's your degree in, dentistry?
L536088	u2951	m194	BONES	Reading the patient's vital signs.
L536087	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L536086	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	I was not informed about observers.
L536085	u2951	m194	BONES	We're just -- observing.
L536084	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
L535383	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
L535382	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
L535381	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	Damage report!
L535375	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
L535374	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	Can you isolate the wave?
L535373	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
L535372	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	What's causing that!?
L535944	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
L535943	u2970	m194	UHURA	How long?
L535784	u2970	m194	UHURA	It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
L535783	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	... It gives me a great sense of history.
L535782	u2970	m194	UHURA	I have the coordinates of the reactor...
L535781	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
L535695	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	"Yes, under ""U.S. Government."" Now we need directions."
L535694	u2970	m194	UHURA	Find it?
L536004	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I'm wery sorry, but --
L536003	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Go ahead. Stun me.
L536002	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
L536001	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
L535995	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I am? May I go now?
L535994	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	You play games with me and you're through
L535993	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I do not know your name.
L535992	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	No, <u>my</u> name.
L535991	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	My name?
L535990	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Name?
L535989	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	The top of what?
L535988	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	All right. Let's take it from the top.
L535987	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
L535986	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
L535985	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Like what?
L535984	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
L536246	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
L536245	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
L536140	u2958	m194	KIRK	Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
L536139	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
L535789	u2958	m194	KIRK	Understood. What is your plan?
L535788	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
L535787	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ah, well done, team 2.
L535647	u2958	m194	KIRK	Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
L535646	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Yes, sir.
L535603	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Sir, heat shields at maximum!
L535602	u2958	m194	KIRK	No choice now, Scotty!
L535597	u2958	m194	KIRK	May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
L535596	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Shields, aye.
L535595	u2958	m194	KIRK	Shields, Mr. Chekov.
L535494	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
L535493	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
L535460	u2958	m194	KIRK	Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
L535459	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
L535458	u2958	m194	KIRK	I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
L535457	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
L535445	u2960	m194	MORROW	We are launching everything we have.
L535444	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Can you protect us?
L535443	u2960	m194	MORROW	We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
L535442	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Neutralized? How?
L535441	u2960	m194	MORROW	Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
L535440	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Status report, Admiral!
L535886	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
L535885	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You sure you won't change your mind?
L535822	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
L535821	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
L535807	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I was not.
L535806	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	So you were at Berkeley.
L535743	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The hell they did.
L535742	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I suppose they told you that...?
L535741	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
L535735	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
L535734	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Attempting the hell to communicate.
L535717	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
L535716	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
L536284	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
L536283	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
L536282	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Why does it have to be goodbye?
L536281	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean this is -- goodbye?
L536280	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
L536279	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hey! -- Where you going?!
L536220	u2958	m194	KIRK	... You have a point...
L536219	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
L536218	u2958	m194	KIRK	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
L536217	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... What does that mean?
L536178	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
L536177	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Oh my God, we're too late!
L536135	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You need me.
L536134	u2958	m194	KIRK	You tricked me.
L536127	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
L536126	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
L536125	u2958	m194	KIRK	I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
L536124	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
L536123	u2958	m194	KIRK	You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
L536122	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
L536121	u2958	m194	KIRK	All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
L536120	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
L536119	u2958	m194	KIRK	Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
L536117	u2958	m194	KIRK	Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
L536116	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
L536045	u2958	m194	KIRK	A spaceship with a missing man.
L536044	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
L536041	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Damn!
L536040	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
L536039	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Gone?!
L536038	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Kirk. They're gone.
L536037	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
L536036	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	But Kirk...
L536035	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
L536034	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
L536033	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady, now. We need your help.
L536032	u2958	m194	KIRK	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
L536031	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	It's true... what you said...
L535955	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.
L535954	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Here... In the park?
L535953	u2958	m194	KIRK	Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
L535952	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I bet you're a damn good poker player.
L535951	u2958	m194	KIRK	Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
L535950	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	So. There we are.
L535949	u2958	m194	KIRK	It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
L535948	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
L535947	u2958	m194	KIRK	You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
L535946	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	"Well, ""Admiral,"" that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard."
L535938	u2958	m194	KIRK	Noon tomorrow...?!
L535937	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
L535936	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
L535935	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
L535934	u2958	m194	KIRK	You want the details?
L535933	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
L535932	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
L535931	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I'm all ears.
L535930	u2958	m194	KIRK	All right. The truth?
L535929	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
L535928	u2958	m194	KIRK	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
L535927	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
L535926	u2958	m194	KIRK	Who do you think I am?
L535925	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... Who are you?
L535924	u2958	m194	KIRK	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
L535923	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Wanna try it from the top?
L535919	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
L535918	u2958	m194	KIRK	What's what?
L535917	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What's that?
L535916	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
L535915	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you mean now?
L535914	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
L535913	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
L535912	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
L535911	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hm?
L535910	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Where could you take them?
L535909	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
L535908	u2958	m194	KIRK	If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
L535907	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Thanks. Cheers.
L535906	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
L535905	u2958	m194	KIRK	You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
L535904	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
L535903	u2958	m194	KIRK	Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
L535902	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
L535901	u2958	m194	KIRK	How will that be done, exactly?
L535900	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... You're very perceptive.
L535899	u2958	m194	KIRK	You're upset about losing the whales.
L535898	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Just lucky, I guess.
L535897	u2958	m194	KIRK	So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
L535894	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
L535893	u2958	m194	KIRK	Implicitly.
L535892	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Do you trust me?
L535891	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's his way.
L535890	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
L535888	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
L535887	u2958	m194	KIRK	Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
L535831	u2958	m194	KIRK	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
L535830	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Or believe, I'll bet.
L535829	u2958	m194	KIRK	In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
L535828	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Then --
L535827	u2958	m194	KIRK	We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
L535826	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
L535824	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
L535823	u2958	m194	KIRK	No, ma'am. No dipshit.
L535817	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
L535816	u2958	m194	KIRK	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
L535815	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They're gonna hafta take their chances.
L535814	u2958	m194	KIRK	What's going to happen when you release the whales?
L535813	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Go ahead.
L535812	u2958	m194	KIRK	Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
L535811	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
L535810	u2958	m194	KIRK	Iowa.
L535809	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
L535808	u2958	m194	KIRK	Memory problems, too.
L535805	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
L535804	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thanks.
L535803	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You've already been that. C'mon.
L535802	u2958	m194	KIRK	We don't want to be any trouble.
L535801	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
L535800	u2958	m194	KIRK	He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
L535799	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I buy that. What about him?
L535798	u2958	m194	KIRK	There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
L535797	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
L535796	u2958	m194	KIRK	Back to San Francisco.
L535740	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
L535739	u2958	m194	KIRK	I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
L535738	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
L535726	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
L535725	u2958	m194	KIRK	How soon?
L535724	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
L535723	u2958	m194	KIRK	Why's that?
L535722	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
L535720	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
L535719	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
L535714	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
L535713	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean man...
L536257	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I will, Admiral.
L536256	u2958	m194	KIRK	You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
L536244	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
L536243	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock: Condition report!
L536234	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then... Where the hell are we?
L536233	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They did, Admiral.
L536232	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
L536227	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
L536226	u2958	m194	KIRK	Can we make breakaway speed!?
L536207	u2958	m194	KIRK	<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
L536206	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
L536205	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
L536130	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
L536129	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
L536061	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.  Will you help us?
L536060	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
L536059	u2958	m194	KIRK	Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
L536058	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
L536047	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you, Spock.
L536046	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral. Full power is restored.
L535962	u2958	m194	KIRK	Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
L535961	u2967	m194	SPOCK	In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
L535960	u2958	m194	KIRK	Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
L535959	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
L535958	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
L535957	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The tank will be finished by morning...
L535956	u2958	m194	KIRK	Status?
L535819	u2958	m194	KIRK	He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
L535818	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I meant --
L535793	u2967	m194	SPOCK	How will playing cards help?
L535792	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
L535760	u2958	m194	KIRK	... I see.
L535759	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
L535758	u2958	m194	KIRK	They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
L535757	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
L535756	u2958	m194	KIRK	What else did you learn from your mind meld?
L535755	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The hell I can't
L535754	u2958	m194	KIRK	You've done it before. Can't you remember?
L535753	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Exaggerate.
L535752	u2958	m194	KIRK	You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
L535751	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I cannot tell a lie.
L535750	u2958	m194	KIRK	And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
L535749	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I see.
L535748	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
L535747	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Why not?
L535746	u2958	m194	KIRK	About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
L535745	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Yes?
L535744	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock...
L535737	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
L535736	u2958	m194	KIRK	Come on, fellah -- speak up!
L535708	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Ah... The giants.
L535707	u2958	m194	KIRK	Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
L535706	u2967	m194	SPOCK	For example?
L535705	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
L535704	u2967	m194	SPOCK	"Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: ""Double dumb ass on you"" -- and so forth..."
L535703	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
L535702	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, may I ask you a question?
L535701	u2958	m194	KIRK	Yes.
L535700	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As you observed, a primitive Culture.
L535687	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Simple logic.
L535686	u2967	m194	SPOCK	How do you know this...?
L535685	u2958	m194	KIRK	I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
L535683	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
L535682	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
L535678	u2958	m194	KIRK	And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
L535677	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
L535641	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
L535640	u2958	m194	KIRK	Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
L535639	u2967	m194	SPOCK	We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
L535638	u2958	m194	KIRK	But you said toxic.
L535637	u2967	m194	SPOCK	If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
L535636	u2958	m194	KIRK	Explain.
L535635	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There is a 20th Century possibility.
L535621	u2958	m194	KIRK	Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
L535620	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
L535619	u2958	m194	KIRK	Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
L535616	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well done, Mr. Spock.
L535615	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
L535614	u2958	m194	KIRK	Earth... But when?... Spock?
L535591	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I have.
L535590	u2958	m194	KIRK	You've programmed that from memory...?
L535589	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
L535588	u2958	m194	KIRK	What are the variables...?
L535587	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
L535586	u2958	m194	KIRK	Surely you can be more specific...
L535585	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The late 20th Century.
L535584	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is our target in time?
L535583	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
L535575	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
L535574	u2967	m194	SPOCK	In progress, Admiral.
L535573	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Spock, your computations?
L535546	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
L535545	u2958	m194	KIRK	But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
L535544	u2967	m194	SPOCK	That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
L535543	u2958	m194	KIRK	That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
L535542	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
L535541	u2958	m194	KIRK	Is there any other planet where this species exists?
L535540	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
L535539	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
L535533	u2958	m194	KIRK	Whales?
L535532	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
L535531	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock...?
L535528	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
L535527	u2958	m194	KIRK	Where are you going?!
L535521	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
L535520	u2967	m194	SPOCK	A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
L535519	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
L535472	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
L535471	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
L535470	u2958	m194	KIRK	Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
L535469	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Thank you, Admiral.
L535468	u2958	m194	KIRK	Permission granted.
L535467	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Permission to come aboard.
L536303	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir!
L536302	u2958	m194	KIRK	Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
L536254	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
L536253	u2968	m194	SULU	Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
L536248	u2958	m194	KIRK	Picture, Uhura!
L536247	u2968	m194	SULU	I have no control, sir!
L536184	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
L536183	u2968	m194	SULU	10 seconds, sir!
L536148	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
L536147	u2958	m194	KIRK	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
L536146	u2968	m194	SULU	10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
L536144	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
L536143	u2968	m194	SULU	Three-one-zero, aye!
L536142	u2958	m194	KIRK	Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
L536141	u2968	m194	SULU	Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
L536137	u2958	m194	KIRK	Go, Mr. Sulu.
L536136	u2968	m194	SULU	Ready sir.
L535645	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
L535644	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir. Descending.
L535613	u2958	m194	KIRK	Picture, please.
L535612	u2968	m194	SULU	Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
L535611	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is our condition?
L535610	u2968	m194	SULU	... Aye sir...?
L535609	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
L535607	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
L535606	u2968	m194	SULU	Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
L535605	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
L535604	u2968	m194	SULU	Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
L535599	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady as she goes...
L535598	u2968	m194	SULU	Warp two... three...
L535492	u2958	m194	KIRK	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
L535491	u2968	m194	SULU	Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
L535456	u2958	m194	KIRK	Weapons systems?
L535455	u2968	m194	SULU	Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
L536250	u2958	m194	KIRK	Out of control, and blind as a bat!
L536249	u2970	m194	UHURA	I can't, sir -- Nothing!
L536199	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott -- how soon?
L536198	u2970	m194	UHURA	Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
L536176	u2970	m194	UHURA	Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
L536175	u2958	m194	KIRK	Estimate range, ship to whales!
L536172	u2958	m194	KIRK	On screen.
L536171	u2970	m194	UHURA	Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
L536168	u2958	m194	KIRK	Put them on screen!
L536167	u2970	m194	UHURA	Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
L536166	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bearing!
L536053	u2970	m194	UHURA	Mercy Hospital.
L536052	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura!... Where!
L536051	u2970	m194	UHURA	I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
L536012	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
L536011	u2970	m194	UHURA	Nothing... I should never have left him...
L536010	u2958	m194	KIRK	Any luck...?
L535660	u2958	m194	KIRK	Everyone remember where we parked.
L535659	u2970	m194	UHURA	283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
L535658	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
L535651	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
L535650	u2970	m194	UHURA	I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
L535625	u2958	m194	KIRK	From a city? That doesn't make sense....
L535624	u2970	m194	UHURA	Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
L535618	u2958	m194	KIRK	On speakers.
L535617	u2970	m194	UHURA	Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
L535525	u2970	m194	UHURA	Yes, sir.
L535524	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
L535510	u2958	m194	KIRK	On screen!
L535509	u2970	m194	UHURA	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
L535508	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is it?
L535454	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu?
L535453	u2970	m194	UHURA	Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
L535452	u2958	m194	KIRK	Systems report.  Communications?
L536297	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
L536296	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
L536263	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral, you'll be trapped!
L536262	u2958	m194	KIRK	Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
L536261	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
L536260	u2958	m194	KIRK	The explosive override -- ?
L536259	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	No power to the bay doors.
L536258	u2958	m194	KIRK	The whales...?!
L536222	u2958	m194	KIRK	On my way...!
L536221	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
L536214	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
L536213	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
L536203	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, if you please.
L536202	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Full power, sir.
L536201	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
L536200	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
L536197	u2958	m194	KIRK	Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
L536196	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'll have to re-energize.
L536195	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
L536194	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral! There be whales here!
L536193	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
L536192	u2958	m194	KIRK	How long, Scotty?
L536191	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
L536150	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
L536149	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
L536132	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu?
L536131	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
L536016	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
L536015	u2958	m194	KIRK	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
L536014	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
L535922	u2958	m194	KIRK	Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
L535921	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
L535920	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
L535634	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
L535633	u2958	m194	KIRK	I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
L535632	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
L535631	u2958	m194	KIRK	Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
L535630	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
L535563	u2958	m194	KIRK	It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
L535562	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Two?
L535561	u2958	m194	KIRK	You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
L535560	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
L535559	u2958	m194	KIRK	Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
L535558	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Humpbacked - people.?
L535557	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
L535555	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
L535554	u2958	m194	KIRK	That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
L535553	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	About 60 feet, Admiral.
L535552	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, how long is this bay?
L535462	u2958	m194	KIRK	Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
L535461	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
L535414	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
L535413	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
L535464	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
L535463	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
L535423	u2958	m194	KIRK	You will be in good hands here.
L535422	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	I am well, Admiral.
L535421	u2958	m194	KIRK	Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
L535420	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
L535419	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
L535418	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
L535398	u2964	m194	SAREK	Do you have the right to murder?
L535397	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
L535396	u2964	m194	SAREK	Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
L535395	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
L535394	u2964	m194	SAREK	Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
L535393	u2964	m194	SAREK	Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
L535392	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	"Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called ""The Genesis Planet..."" A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!"
L535876	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
L535875	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	That's the ticket, laddie.
L535874	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Transparent aluminum?
L535873	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	The keyboard... How quaint.
L535872	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Just use the keyboard...
L535871	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Hello? Computer...?
L535867	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... Are you joking?
L535866	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
L535865	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
L535864	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
L535863	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Sill? What else would I be working with?
L535862	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I notice you're still working with polymers.
L535861	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... Yes?
L535860	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
L535849	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Of course.
L535848	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I will. Can my assistant come, too?
L535847	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	If you'll follow me, Professor --
L535846	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Well, that's different.
L535845	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	With pleasure.
L535842	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I demand to see the owners! I demand --
L535841	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Professor Scott, if you'll --
L535838	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Millions?
L535837	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
L535856	u2968	m194	SULU	Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
L535855	u2962	m194	PILOT	All right, then this is old stuff to you.
L535854	u2968	m194	SULU	Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
L535853	u2962	m194	PILOT	Right on. You fly?
L535852	u2968	m194	SULU	Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
L535851	u2962	m194	PILOT	Hi.
L536293	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Tell her I feel fine...
L536292	u2964	m194	SAREK	Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
L536291	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They are my friends.
L536290	u2964	m194	SAREK	As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
L536289	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Most kind, Father.
L536288	u2964	m194	SAREK	It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
L536287	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It is kind of you to make this effort.
L536286	u2964	m194	SAREK	I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
L536285	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Father...?
L535672	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
L535671	u2968	m194	SULU	Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
L535670	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Sulu Hikaru.
L535669	u2968	m194	SULU	Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
L535668	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
L535667	u2968	m194	SULU	Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
L535666	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
L537130	u2980	m195	PICARD	"The ""mighty"" Federation could learn a few things from this village..."
L537129	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
L537117	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I'll be here.
L537116	u2980	m195	PICARD	But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
L537112	u2980	m195	PICARD	I thought it might begin the healing process.
L537111	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Mother and son. You arranged this...?
L537007	u2980	m195	PICARD	You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
L537006	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
L536893	u2980	m195	PICARD	This way!
L536892	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
L536867	u2980	m195	PICARD	I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
L536866	u2971	m195	ANIJ	What's the rush?
L536865	u2980	m195	PICARD	"How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you ""just haven't gotten around to it yet""..."
L536863	u2980	m195	PICARD	By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
L536862	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
L536859	u2980	m195	PICARD	Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
L536858	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Jak'tahla?
L536799	u2980	m195	PICARD	We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
L536798	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There are caves in those mountains.
L536797	u2980	m195	PICARD	When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
L536730	u2971	m195	ANIJ	For someone so young.
L536729	u2980	m195	PICARD	... an offlander?
L536728	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
L536727	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
L536726	u2980	m195	PICARD	There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
L536725	u2971	m195	ANIJ	It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
L536724	u2980	m195	PICARD	I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
L536723	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
L536722	u2980	m195	PICARD	Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
L536721	u2971	m195	ANIJ	When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
L536720	u2980	m195	PICARD	A perfect moment?
L536719	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
L536718	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will it?
L536717	u2971	m195	ANIJ	More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
L536716	u2980	m195	PICARD	An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
L536715	u2971	m195	ANIJ	This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
L536714	u2980	m195	PICARD	The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
L536713	u2980	m195	PICARD	You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
L536712	u2971	m195	ANIJ	... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
L536711	u2980	m195	PICARD	In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
L536710	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
L536709	u2980	m195	PICARD	There are days.
L536708	u2971	m195	ANIJ	But not you.
L536707	u2980	m195	PICARD	Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
L536706	u2971	m195	ANIJ	We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
L536705	u2980	m195	PICARD	Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
L536696	u2980	m195	PICARD	We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
L536695	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
L536663	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
L536662	u2980	m195	PICARD	Don't panic...
L536657	u2980	m195	PICARD	To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
L536656	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Deceive us?
L536653	u2980	m195	PICARD	Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
L536652	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
L536609	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Then you must spend your life answering questions.
L536608	u2980	m195	PICARD	I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
L536607	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Why?
L536606	u2980	m195	PICARD	I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
L536549	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
L536548	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have warp capability?
L536543	u2980	m195	PICARD	If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
L536542	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
L536541	u2980	m195	PICARD	My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
L536537	u2971	m195	ANIJ	It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
L536536	u2980	m195	PICARD	We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
L537134	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Bye.
L537133	u2974	m195	DATA	I have to go home now.
L536968	u2974	m195	DATA	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
L536967	u2972	m195	ARTIM	No... I want to stay with you...
L536966	u2974	m195	DATA	Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
L536965	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Anij!
L536855	u2972	m195	ARTIM	If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
L536854	u2974	m195	DATA	No one's ever asked me that before.
L536853	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Why not...?
L536852	u2974	m195	DATA	Androids... don't have...fun.
L536851	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
L536850	u2974	m195	DATA	But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
L536849	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
L536848	u2974	m195	DATA	For what purpose?
L536847	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Chase me!
L536844	u2972	m195	ARTIM	No, I mean...
L536843	u2974	m195	DATA	I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
L536842	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Do machines ever play?
L536841	u2974	m195	DATA	I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
L536840	u2972	m195	ARTIM	But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
L536839	u2974	m195	DATA	My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
L536838	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Sometimes I do.
L536837	u2974	m195	DATA	But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
L536836	u2972	m195	ARTIM	For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
L536835	u2974	m195	DATA	Really.
L536834	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Really?
L536833	u2974	m195	DATA	Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
L536832	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
L536831	u2974	m195	DATA	My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
L536830	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Don't you ever get tired?
L536829	u2974	m195	DATA	Perhaps, that is true.
L536828	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
L536827	u2974	m195	DATA	I aspire to be more than I am.
L536826	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
L536825	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I don't.
L536824	u2974	m195	DATA	I understand.
L536823	u2972	m195	ARTIM	My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
L536612	u2974	m195	DATA	I am better.
L536611	u2972	m195	ARTIM	You're what?
L536610	u2974	m195	DATA	There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
L536701	u2980	m195	PICARD	If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
L536700	u2972	m195	ARTIM	The artificial lifeform was right?
L536699	u2980	m195	PICARD	To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
L536639	u2980	m195	PICARD	No.
L536638	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Won't he rust?
L536637	u2980	m195	PICARD	Data doesn't breathe.
L536636	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Can he breathe under water?
L536684	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
L536683	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
L536682	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	Are they in any danger?
L536681	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
L536680	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	And our people?
L536679	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
L536988	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Safer than leaving her here.
L536987	u2980	m195	PICARD	Is it safe to move her?
L536986	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	She's stabilizing.
L536956	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Yes. But look at this medscan...
L536955	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will he live?
L536535	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
L536534	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
L536349	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
L536348	u2980	m195	PICARD	Very funny...
L536328	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
L536327	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
L536326	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
L536934	u2974	m195	DATA	I believe it is safe, sir.
L536933	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will the structure hold if we blast through?
L536932	u2974	m195	DATA	I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
L536927	u2974	m195	DATA	Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
L536926	u2980	m195	PICARD	How many?
L536801	u2980	m195	PICARD	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
L536800	u2974	m195	DATA	Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
L536659	u2980	m195	PICARD	I don't know.
L536658	u2974	m195	DATA	Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
L536655	u2980	m195	PICARD	What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
L536654	u2974	m195	DATA	... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
L536651	u2980	m195	PICARD	What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
L536650	u2974	m195	DATA	Incomplete, I might add.
L536645	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
L536644	u2974	m195	DATA	It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
L536643	u2980	m195	PICARD	A ship,
L536634	u2980	m195	PICARD	How about a passive radiation scan?
L536633	u2974	m195	DATA	Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
L536617	u2974	m195	DATA	And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
L536616	u2980	m195	PICARD	Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
L536615	u2974	m195	DATA	... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
L536614	u2980	m195	PICARD	It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
L536613	u2974	m195	DATA	I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
L536601	u2974	m195	DATA	I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
L536600	u2980	m195	PICARD	From the mission...
L536599	u2974	m195	DATA	'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
L536598	u2980	m195	PICARD	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
L536597	u2974	m195	DATA	Yes... that looks like them.
L536594	u2980	m195	PICARD	You're aboard the Enterprise.
L536593	u2974	m195	DATA	Captain, Geordi...?
L536592	u2980	m195	PICARD	Hello, Data...
L537013	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
L537012	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	I do not take orders from you.
L537011	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	It is over.
L537010	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	It is not over.
L537009	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
L536999	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
L536998	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You're not going to launch anything until...
L536820	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
L536819	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'll order Riker to turn around.
L536816	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
L536815	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
L536814	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
L536813	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
L536467	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
L536466	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
L536464	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
L536463	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
L536392	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
L536391	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
L536390	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Another time.
L536389	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
L536387	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
L536386	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
L536385	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
L536996	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	There's nothing further to be gained from this...
L536995	u2980	m195	PICARD	I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
L536992	u2980	m195	PICARD	If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
L536991	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
L536764	u2980	m195	PICARD	How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
L536763	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
L536762	u2980	m195	PICARD	We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
L536761	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Ba'ku.
L536760	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
L536759	u2980	m195	PICARD	Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
L536758	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
L536757	u2980	m195	PICARD	Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
L536756	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
L536755	u2980	m195	PICARD	There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
L536754	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
L536753	u2980	m195	PICARD	Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
L536752	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
L536751	u2980	m195	PICARD	Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
L536750	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
L536749	u2980	m195	PICARD	A planet in Federation space...
L536748	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
L536747	u2980	m195	PICARD	Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
L536746	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
L536745	u2980	m195	PICARD	How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
L536744	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
L536743	u2980	m195	PICARD	... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
L536742	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
L536741	u2980	m195	PICARD	"Your ""Briar Patch"" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected."
L536740	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
L536557	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
L536556	u2980	m195	PICARD	You're not finished here?
L536555	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
L536554	u2980	m195	PICARD	In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
L536553	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
L536552	u2980	m195	PICARD	... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
L536471	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Good luck. Dougherty out.
L536470	u2980	m195	PICARD	Understood.
L536469	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
L536462	u2980	m195	PICARD	Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
L536461	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
L536460	u2980	m195	PICARD	This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
L536459	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
L536376	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
L536375	u2980	m195	PICARD	What kind of concerns?
L536374	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
L536373	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
L536372	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
L536371	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
L537095	u2980	m195	PICARD	Scan for lifesigns.
L537094	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
L537039	u2980	m195	PICARD	What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
L537038	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
L537037	u2980	m195	PICARD	If we could lure him away from the bridge...
L537036	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
L537035	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know how to disable the injector?
L537034	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
L537032	u2980	m195	PICARD	I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
L537031	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
L537030	u2980	m195	PICARD	A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
L537023	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Thank-you for reminding me.
L537022	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
L537021	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
L537020	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
L537019	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
L537018	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Deploy the collector.
L537017	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	May I talk to you alone?
L537016	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
L536818	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
L536817	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
L536812	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Recommendations?
L536811	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
L536791	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
L536790	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
L536789	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
L536771	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
L536770	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
L536769	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
L536734	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
L536733	u2980	m195	PICARD	... had regenerated.
L536732	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
L536591	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
L536590	u2980	m195	PICARD	Implants bothering you?
L536589	u2980	m195	PICARD	And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
L536588	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
L536587	u2980	m195	PICARD	So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
L536586	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
L536585	u2980	m195	PICARD	Fail-safe?
L536584	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
L536583	u2980	m195	PICARD	Why would they fire at him without provocation?
L536582	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I don't believe it happened that way.
L536581	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
L536580	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
L536579	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know how they were damaged?
L536578	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
L536454	u2980	m195	PICARD	When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
L536453	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
L536414	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you have everything you need from command?
L536413	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
L536383	u2980	m195	PICARD	Are they...?
L536382	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	They... are in opposite directions, sir...
L536381	u2980	m195	PICARD	I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
L536916	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
L536915	u2982	m195	RIKER	That's your expert opinion?
L536914	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	You got me, Commander.
L536913	u2982	m195	RIKER	Will that stop the tear?
L536881	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I'll be in Engineering.
L536880	u2982	m195	RIKER	If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
L536879	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
L536878	u2982	m195	RIKER	Full impulse.
L536877	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
L536876	u2982	m195	RIKER	A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
L536945	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
L536944	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	If it works you mean.
L536943	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
L536939	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The purpose being...?
L536938	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
L536937	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
L536912	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Eject the core.
L536911	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Options?
L536910	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
L536942	u2982	m195	RIKER	It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
L536941	u2978	m195	NARA	Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
L536940	u2982	m195	RIKER	The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
L536918	u2982	m195	RIKER	Eject the core.
L536917	u2978	m195	NARA	The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
L536906	u2982	m195	RIKER	On screen.
L536905	u2978	m195	NARA	Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
L536875	u2982	m195	RIKER	Why not?
L536874	u2978	m195	NARA	I don't think they believe us.
L536950	u2982	m195	RIKER	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
L536949	u2979	m195	PERIM	They're powering their forward weapons array.
L536925	u2982	m195	RIKER	We're through running from these bastards.
L536924	u2979	m195	PERIM	We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
L536908	u2982	m195	RIKER	Remind me to lodge a protest...
L536907	u2979	m195	PERIM	I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
L536901	u2982	m195	RIKER	Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
L536900	u2979	m195	PERIM	Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
L536899	u2982	m195	RIKER	What's inside that nebula cluster?
L536870	u2979	m195	PERIM	Eighteen minutes...
L536869	u2982	m195	RIKER	How long 'til they reach us?
L536868	u2979	m195	PERIM	Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
L537092	u2980	m195	PICARD	Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
L537091	u2982	m195	RIKER	The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
L536786	u2982	m195	RIKER	Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
L536785	u2980	m195	PICARD	There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
L536777	u2980	m195	PICARD	Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
L536776	u2982	m195	RIKER	You must be planning on doing some hunting.
L536767	u2982	m195	RIKER	Aye, sir.
L536766	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
L536676	u2982	m195	RIKER	You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
L536675	u2980	m195	PICARD	Deck five.
L536674	u2980	m195	PICARD	We're not going anywhere.
L536673	u2982	m195	RIKER	Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
L536410	u2982	m195	RIKER	The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
L536409	u2980	m195	PICARD	So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
L536408	u2982	m195	RIKER	Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
L536407	u2980	m195	PICARD	We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
L536406	u2982	m195	RIKER	... and gorgonzolla cheese.
L536402	u2982	m195	RIKER	Commander Riker...
L536401	u2980	m195	PICARD	Who is it?
L536342	u2982	m195	RIKER	Deck ten.
L536341	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
L536340	u2980	m195	PICARD	... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
L536339	u2982	m195	RIKER	The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
L536338	u2980	m195	PICARD	We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
L536337	u2982	m195	RIKER	They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
L537110	u2985	m195	SOJEF	I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
L537109	u2980	m195	PICARD	Ask them.
L537108	u2985	m195	SOJEF	I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
L536694	u2985	m195	SOJEF	Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
L536693	u2980	m195	PICARD	You've not aged a day since then?
L536692	u2985	m195	SOJEF	We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
L536533	u2985	m195	SOJEF	As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
L536532	u2980	m195	PICARD	No, we're here to... rescue them.
L536531	u2985	m195	SOJEF	Would you like something to eat?
L536530	u2980	m195	PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
L536529	u2985	m195	SOJEF	My name is Sojef, Captain.
L536981	u2980	m195	PICARD	I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
L536980	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
L536979	u2980	m195	PICARD	Worf, you must hurry...
L536976	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	We're trying to get to you, sir...
L536975	u2980	m195	PICARD	Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
L536974	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	Worf to Picard...
L536449	u2980	m195	PICARD	We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
L536448	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
L536412	u2980	m195	PICARD	Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
L536411	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
L537099	u2980	m195	PICARD	Is there any other way to disable the injector?
L537098	u2988	m195	WORF	Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
L537097	u2980	m195	PICARD	Can you beam him off?
L537096	u2988	m195	WORF	One. It's Ru'afo.
L537075	u2980	m195	PICARD	Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
L537074	u2988	m195	WORF	All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
L536891	u2980	m195	PICARD	We have to find shelter...
L536890	u2988	m195	WORF	Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
L536861	u2980	m195	PICARD	Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
L536860	u2988	m195	WORF	The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
L536857	u2988	m195	WORF	Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
L536856	u2980	m195	PICARD	You need a haircut, Commander.
L536803	u2980	m195	PICARD	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
L536802	u2988	m195	WORF	Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
L536678	u2980	m195	PICARD	Picard to Crusher...
L536677	u2988	m195	WORF	Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
L536669	u2980	m195	PICARD	Gorch?
L536668	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir. It is a gorch.
L536667	u2980	m195	PICARD	Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
L536666	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir...
L536665	u2980	m195	PICARD	Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
L536515	u2980	m195	PICARD	Transferring controls to manual.
L536514	u2988	m195	WORF	The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
L536510	u2980	m195	PICARD	I'm not letting go of him.
L536509	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
L536494	u2980	m195	PICARD	"They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  ""A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."""
L536493	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
L536492	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
L536490	u2980	m195	PICARD	Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
L536489	u2988	m195	WORF	Scanners are off line!
L536487	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
L536486	u2988	m195	WORF	He's activated a transport inhibitor.
L536485	u2980	m195	PICARD	Beam him out!
L536484	u2988	m195	WORF	Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
L536483	u2980	m195	PICARD	Make it so.
L536482	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
L536478	u2980	m195	PICARD	Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
L536477	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir?
L536476	u2980	m195	PICARD	Come out, come out wherever you are...
L536475	u2980	m195	PICARD	The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
L536474	u2988	m195	WORF	He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
L536473	u2980	m195	PICARD	Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
L536472	u2988	m195	WORF	Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
L536418	u2980	m195	PICARD	It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
L536417	u2988	m195	WORF	I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
L536353	u2980	m195	PICARD	Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
L536352	u2988	m195	WORF	Captain...
L536528	u2987	m195	TROI	They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
L536527	u2980	m195	PICARD	Counselor?
L536416	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
L536415	u2987	m195	TROI	We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
L536332	u2980	m195	PICARD	Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
L536331	u2987	m195	TROI	Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
L536325	u2987	m195	TROI	Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
L536324	u2980	m195	PICARD	Say the greeting again...
L536323	u2987	m195	TROI	... Population three hundred million...
L536883	u2987	m195	TROI	And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
L536882	u2982	m195	RIKER	All hands. Battle stations!
L536575	u2987	m195	TROI	I never kissed you with a beard before.
L536574	u2982	m195	RIKER	Augh?
L536573	u2987	m195	TROI	Augh.
L536572	u2987	m195	TROI	On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
L536571	u2982	m195	RIKER	What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
L536570	u2987	m195	TROI	... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
L536569	u2982	m195	RIKER	... I'm not sleeping well...
L536568	u2987	m195	TROI	... I believe you...
L536567	u2982	m195	RIKER	Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
L536565	u2987	m195	TROI	You're in quite a mood today.
L536564	u2982	m195	RIKER	Or you could try lying down.
L536563	u2987	m195	TROI	Why don't you try sitting up?
L536562	u2982	m195	RIKER	But it's comfortable.
L536561	u2987	m195	TROI	This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
L536560	u2987	m195	TROI	Whatever makes you comfortable...
L536559	u2982	m195	RIKER	Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
L536558	u2987	m195	TROI	Come in.  Hi.
L536440	u2982	m195	RIKER	If that's true, they're a dying race.
L536439	u2987	m195	TROI	No children?
L536438	u2982	m195	RIKER	It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
L536437	u2987	m195	TROI	Was I doing something to your neck?
L536436	u2982	m195	RIKER	What you're doing to my neck...
L536435	u2987	m195	TROI	What...?
L536434	u2982	m195	RIKER	You haven't done that in a long time...
L536433	u2982	m195	RIKER	Good question.
L536432	u2987	m195	TROI	Why would we be involved with these people?
L536429	u2982	m195	RIKER	You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
L536428	u2987	m195	TROI	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
L536427	u2982	m195	RIKER	Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
L536426	u2987	m195	TROI	You should feel right at home with them.
L536425	u2982	m195	RIKER	Wine, women and song.
L536424	u2987	m195	TROI	What are they interested in...?
L536423	u2982	m195	RIKER	I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
L536421	u2987	m195	TROI	Environmental concerns, again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
L536420	u2982	m195	RIKER	Why was Data assigned?
L536419	u2987	m195	TROI	The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
L537083	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
L537082	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
L537081	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
L537068	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	All ship functions are off-line.
L537067	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
L537066	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
L537065	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Exactly as the simulations predicted...
L537042	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	Activating injector assembly.
L537041	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Initiate launch sequence.
L540238	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	I look forward to reading your report.
L540237	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
L540236	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
L540235	u2997	m196	PICARD	Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
L539574	u2997	m196	PICARD	Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
L539573	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	Good hunting. Hayes out.
L539572	u2997	m196	PICARD	Absolutely.
L539571	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
L540019	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	"I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our ""sense of duty."" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not."
L540018	u2997	m196	PICARD	Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
L540017	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
L540016	u2997	m196	PICARD	Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
L540013	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	That might not be so bad... at least for you.
L540012	u2997	m196	PICARD	If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
L540011	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	You think they're still up there?
L540010	u2997	m196	PICARD	Not yet.
L540009	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
L540008	u2997	m196	PICARD	How did Doctor Almack react to that?
L540007	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
L540006	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
L540005	u2997	m196	PICARD	You actually performed surgery...?
L539788	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
L539787	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
L539774	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	That'll be interesting.
L539773	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
L539772	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
L539721	u2997	m196	PICARD	Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
L539720	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	There must be some good people... even in this time.
L539719	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
L539718	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Are you saying they won't help us?
L539717	u2997	m196	PICARD	It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
L539716	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	What are we waiting for? Let's go.
L539715	u2997	m196	PICARD	As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
L539714	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
L539713	u2997	m196	PICARD	It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
L539708	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
L539707	u2997	m196	PICARD	It's Cochrane.
L539661	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
L539660	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
L539659	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
L539658	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes...
L539657	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
L539656	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
L539655	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
L539651	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
L539650	u2997	m196	PICARD	Montana.  Energize.
L539906	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
L539905	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
L539761	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Bag him.
L539760	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
L539755	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
L539754	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
L539753	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Is it Japanese?
L539746	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	At least four hours.
L539745	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	How long has he been unconscious?
L540182	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Do it.
L540181	u2993	m196	DATA	I believe so.
L540180	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Can you configure it?
L540179	u2993	m196	DATA	The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
L540178	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
L540163	u2993	m196	DATA	No.
L540162	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Vulcan?
L540161	u2993	m196	DATA	There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
L540142	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
L540141	u2993	m196	DATA	No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
L540140	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
L540139	u2993	m196	DATA	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
L540138	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Isn't it better like this...?
L540136	u2993	m196	DATA	No... no, please... you cannot...
L540135	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
L540133	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
L540132	u2993	m196	DATA	Yes...
L540131	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
L540130	u2993	m196	DATA	I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
L540036	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	I'm your creator now.
L540035	u2993	m196	DATA	My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
L540034	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
L540033	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	More lies.
L540032	u2993	m196	DATA	I wish to... go back to the way I was.
L540031	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
L540030	u2993	m196	DATA	I... do not want this...
L540029	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
L540028	u2993	m196	DATA	That is not true. They have tried to help me.
L540027	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
L540026	u2993	m196	DATA	No. I will not betray my friends.
L539932	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
L539931	u2993	m196	DATA	It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
L539930	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Do you know what this is, Data?
L539929	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
L539928	u2993	m196	DATA	I do not know what you are referring to.
L539927	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
L539864	u2993	m196	DATA	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
L539863	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
L539858	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
L539857	u2993	m196	DATA	You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
L539637	u2993	m196	DATA	Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
L539636	u2997	m196	PICARD	Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
L539620	u2993	m196	DATA	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
L539619	u2997	m196	PICARD	What year is it?
L539595	u2997	m196	PICARD	Contact Starfleet Command.
L539594	u2993	m196	DATA	The vortex is collapsing, sir.
L539592	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's the Sphere?
L539591	u2993	m196	DATA	I have helm control.
L539578	u2997	m196	PICARD	What?
L539577	u2993	m196	DATA	It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
L539576	u2997	m196	PICARD	Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
L539575	u2993	m196	DATA	We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
L539555	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ready quantum torpedo.
L539554	u2993	m196	DATA	The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
L539550	u2997	m196	PICARD	Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
L539549	u2993	m196	DATA	Dispersive armor is holding.
L539856	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
L539855	u2993	m196	DATA	That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
L539854	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the Borg.
L539853	u2993	m196	DATA	Who are you?
L539744	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
L539743	u2993	m196	DATA	I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
L539742	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	But now... they are all one with the Borg.
L539670	u3003	m196	TROI	I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
L539669	u2993	m196	DATA	No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
L539668	u3003	m196	TROI	We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
L539667	u2993	m196	DATA	I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
L539666	u3003	m196	TROI	Data... are you sure you're all right?
L539665	u2993	m196	DATA	Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
L539664	u3003	m196	TROI	Did you know her?
L539602	u3003	m196	TROI	But how?
L539601	u2993	m196	DATA	The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
L539771	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
L539770	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	What did you do to the batteries?
L539766	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
L539765	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where?
L539764	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	I told you, there's no --
L539763	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's the battery room for the hospital?
L539757	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
L539756	u2997	m196	PICARD	Juice?
L539750	u2997	m196	PICARD	Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
L539749	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	APR cell count? What the hell are you talking about?
L540185	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're crossing the threshold!
L540184	u2995	m196	GEORDI	They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
L540174	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
L540173	u2997	m196	PICARD	Their com system must still be down.
L540172	u2997	m196	PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
L540171	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain, the Enterprise!
L540170	u2997	m196	PICARD	One minute to warp threshold...
L540169	u2995	m196	GEORDI	There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
L540168	u2997	m196	PICARD	Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
L540167	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
L540166	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm on it...
L540165	u2997	m196	PICARD	Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
L540149	u2997	m196	PICARD	<U>Engage.</U>
L540148	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
L540147	u2997	m196	PICARD	Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
L540146	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
L540145	u2997	m196	PICARD	As they used to say... all systems are go.
L540144	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
L540127	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
L540126	u2997	m196	PICARD	There's a red light on the second intake valve.
L540125	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Entering the upper ionospere...
L540124	u2997	m196	PICARD	Altitude fifty kilometers...
L540123	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
L540097	u2997	m196	PICARD	Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
L540096	u2995	m196	GEORDI	What's still there?
L540095	u2997	m196	PICARD	Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
L540094	u2995	m196	GEORDI	No... the door's too thick.
L540092	u2997	m196	PICARD	It'll have to wait. Come on.
L540091	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
L540089	u2997	m196	PICARD	This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
L540088	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain --
L540070	u2997	m196	PICARD	She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
L540069	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
L540068	u2997	m196	PICARD	We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
L540064	u2997	m196	PICARD	Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
L540063	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Always am.
L540062	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ready to make a little history?
L539983	u2995	m196	GEORDI	They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
L539982	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
L539851	u2997	m196	PICARD	If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
L539850	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
L539844	u2995	m196	GEORDI	We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
L539843	u2997	m196	PICARD	We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
L539842	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
L539841	u2997	m196	PICARD	Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
L539840	u2995	m196	GEORDI	This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
L539710	u2995	m196	GEORDI	It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
L539709	u2997	m196	PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
L539701	u2997	m196	PICARD	There should be some kind of manual release...
L539700	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
L539695	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have the password right here.
L539694	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
L539692	u2997	m196	PICARD	There should be an access hatch nearby...
L539691	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
L539689	u2997	m196	PICARD	Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
L539688	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
L539687	u2997	m196	PICARD	How serious is the damage?
L539686	u2995	m196	GEORDI	This must be it.
L539654	u2997	m196	PICARD	Let's go.
L539653	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
L539560	u2997	m196	PICARD	Understood. Keep me informed.
L539559	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
L540057	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
L540056	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Ready.
L540055	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	Main bus...
L540054	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Active.
L540053	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	ATR setting...
L539991	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
L539990	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
L539989	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
L539988	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	It'll be tight, but we should make it.
L539987	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
L540112	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
L540111	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
L540110	u2997	m196	PICARD	From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
L540107	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
L540106	u2997	m196	PICARD	There is no invasion...
L540102	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	"These people you're calling ""Vulcans""... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?"
L540101	u2997	m196	PICARD	Invasion.
L540100	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	The invasion plans.
L540099	u2997	m196	PICARD	What do you want?
L539817	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Not yet.
L539816	u2997	m196	PICARD	Something wrong with that?
L539815	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	You seem to have an answer for everything.
L539814	u2997	m196	PICARD	I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
L539813	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
L539812	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes.
L539811	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
L539810	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
L539809	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
L539808	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Huh.
L539807	u2997	m196	PICARD	It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
L539806	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
L539805	u2997	m196	PICARD	There's a few of us left.
L539804	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
L539803	u2997	m196	PICARD	California. San Francisco.
L539802	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Where are you from most recently?
L539801	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
L539800	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
L539799	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Where in the States?
L539797	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	You don't sound French.
L539796	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes.
L539795	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Great name. French?
L539794	u2997	m196	PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard.
L539793	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
L539792	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
L540217	u3001	m196	RUBY	You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
L540216	u2997	m196	PICARD	This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
L540215	u3001	m196	RUBY	Why?
L540214	u2997	m196	PICARD	That's impossible.
L540213	u3001	m196	RUBY	I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
L540212	u2997	m196	PICARD	No... I'm from France.
L540211	u3001	m196	RUBY	It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
L540210	u2997	m196	PICARD	No. It's a lot further than that.
L540209	u3001	m196	RUBY	Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
L540208	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have to...
L540207	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're leaving, aren't you?
L539955	u2997	m196	PICARD	I am not a thief...
L539954	u3001	m196	RUBY	And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
L539953	u2997	m196	PICARD	Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
L539950	u3001	m196	RUBY	Or...?
L539949	u2997	m196	PICARD	We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
L539948	u3001	m196	RUBY	All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
L539947	u2997	m196	PICARD	A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
L539946	u3001	m196	RUBY	Lie. That's one. Keep going.
L539945	u2997	m196	PICARD	Some.
L539944	u3001	m196	RUBY	Friends from Cornell...
L539943	u2997	m196	PICARD	Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
L539942	u3001	m196	RUBY	We?
L539941	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
L539940	u3001	m196	RUBY	Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
L539939	u3001	m196	RUBY	Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
L539938	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'd say you already have.
L539917	u3001	m196	RUBY	Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
L539916	u2997	m196	PICARD	It can't wait until tomorrow...
L539915	u3001	m196	RUBY	I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
L539914	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
L539909	u2997	m196	PICARD	How did you know about that?
L539908	u3001	m196	RUBY	No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
L539907	u2997	m196	PICARD	Were the two of you... involved?
L539903	u2997	m196	PICARD	Are you always sucha good judge of character?
L539902	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
L539901	u2997	m196	PICARD	What makes you say that?
L539900	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're lying.
L539899	u2997	m196	PICARD	What?
L539898	u3001	m196	RUBY	'Fraid not.
L539897	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
L539896	u3001	m196	RUBY	Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
L539895	u2997	m196	PICARD	No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
L539894	u3001	m196	RUBY	You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
L539893	u2997	m196	PICARD	I can try.
L539892	u3001	m196	RUBY	Money. So you can get dome money...
L539889	u2997	m196	PICARD	Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
L539888	u3001	m196	RUBY	Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
L539887	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
L539886	u3001	m196	RUBY	Did you need something?
L539884	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm very sorry.
L539883	u3001	m196	RUBY	Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
L539882	u2997	m196	PICARD	Cochrane?
L539881	u3001	m196	RUBY	Thank God this plate was already fixed.
L539880	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
L539879	u3001	m196	RUBY	What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
L539780	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes, he is.
L539779	u3001	m196	RUBY	Take care of him. He's a very special man.
L539626	u3003	m196	TROI	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
L539625	u2997	m196	PICARD	Track their weapons fire.
L539610	u2997	m196	PICARD	We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
L539609	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain...?
L539600	u3003	m196	TROI	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
L539599	u2997	m196	PICARD	Life signs?
L539562	u2997	m196	PICARD	On screen.
L539561	u3003	m196	TROI	Incoming transmission from the Borg.
L539548	u3003	m196	TROI	Aye, sir.
L539547	u2997	m196	PICARD	Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
L540234	u2997	m196	PICARD	Onscreen.
L540233	u3005	m196	WORF	Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
L539642	u3005	m196	WORF	Aye, sir.
L539641	u2997	m196	PICARD	Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
L539635	u2997	m196	PICARD	Fire!
L539634	u3005	m196	WORF	Target locked!
L539624	u2997	m196	PICARD	Go to manual.
L539623	u3005	m196	WORF	Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
L539622	u2997	m196	PICARD	Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
L539621	u3005	m196	WORF	Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
L539613	u2997	m196	PICARD	Steady as she goes.
L539612	u3005	m196	WORF	Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
L539608	u2997	m196	PICARD	Data, set a course for that vortex.
L539607	u3005	m196	WORF	Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
L539584	u3005	m196	WORF	Aye, sir.
L539583	u2997	m196	PICARD	Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
L539552	u2997	m196	PICARD	Fire.
L539551	u3005	m196	WORF	Port battery, ready sir!
L540231	u2999	m196	RIKER	No, sir.
L540230	u2997	m196	PICARD	Unless you'd like to stay.
L540229	u2999	m196	RIKER	Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
L540228	u2997	m196	PICARD	Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
L540227	u2999	m196	RIKER	Yes, sir.
L540226	u2997	m196	PICARD	Return to our own time?
L539648	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
L539647	u2999	m196	RIKER	Good luck, sir.
L539646	u2997	m196	PICARD	Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
L539645	u2999	m196	RIKER	And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
L539644	u2997	m196	PICARD	In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
L539643	u2999	m196	RIKER	Captain?
L539640	u2999	m196	RIKER	Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
L539639	u2997	m196	PICARD	Life signs?
L539638	u2999	m196	RIKER	Looks like they damaged the silo...
L539618	u2997	m196	PICARD	On screen.
L539617	u2999	m196	RIKER	We're still in Earth orbit.
L539616	u2997	m196	PICARD	Report.
L539604	u2999	m196	RIKER	They did it... they assimilated Earth.
L539603	u2997	m196	PICARD	They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
L539590	u2997	m196	PICARD	Worf... torpedo... now!
L539589	u2999	m196	RIKER	We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
L540158	u3005	m196	WORF	Nothing.
L540157	u2999	m196	RIKER	Emergency override!
L540156	u3005	m196	WORF	We've lost Bridge control!
L540155	u2999	m196	RIKER	Report!
L540052	u3005	m196	WORF	Understood!
L540051	u2999	m196	RIKER	Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
L540049	u2999	m196	RIKER	I'll keep that in mind.
L540048	u3005	m196	WORF	And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
L540047	u2999	m196	RIKER	Right.
L540046	u3005	m196	WORF	Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
L540045	u2999	m196	RIKER	Just a little queasy...
L540044	u3005	m196	WORF	Are you alright?
L540039	u3005	m196	WORF	The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
L540038	u2999	m196	RIKER	I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
L540037	u3005	m196	WORF	You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
L539974	u3005	m196	WORF	Destroy the deflector dish.
L539973	u2999	m196	RIKER	Agreed. Options?
L539972	u3005	m196	WORF	We have to stop them from sending that message.
L539968	u3005	m196	WORF	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
L539967	u2999	m196	RIKER	They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
L539966	u2999	m196	RIKER	Computer -- thermal enhancement.
L539965	u3005	m196	WORF	They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
L539960	u3005	m196	WORF	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
L539959	u2999	m196	RIKER	What are they doing?
L539877	u2999	m196	RIKER	We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
L539876	u3005	m196	WORF	To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
L539871	u2999	m196	RIKER	We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
L539870	u3005	m196	WORF	We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
L539733	u3005	m196	WORF	It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
L539732	u2999	m196	RIKER	What the hell is happening, Worf?
L539730	u2999	m196	RIKER	What?
L539729	u3005	m196	WORF	A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
L539723	u2999	m196	RIKER	Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
L539722	u3005	m196	WORF	I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
L539569	u3005	m196	WORF	Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
L539568	u2999	m196	RIKER	Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
L540153	u2999	m196	RIKER	Hold that thought.
L540152	u3003	m196	TROI	I have to admit there was a moment there when --
L539980	u2999	m196	RIKER	I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
L539979	u3003	m196	TROI	What are you suggesting?
L539978	u2999	m196	RIKER	I remember it made me sick.
L539962	u2999	m196	RIKER	Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
L539961	u3003	m196	TROI	To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
L539925	u2999	m196	RIKER	Where the hell are they going?
L539924	u3003	m196	TROI	They're bypassing Engineering...
L539869	u3003	m196	TROI	Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
L539868	u2999	m196	RIKER	All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
L539737	u2999	m196	RIKER	Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
L539736	u3003	m196	TROI	Wil... Data was down there.
L539735	u2999	m196	RIKER	The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
L539734	u3003	m196	TROI	Someone...?
L539728	u3003	m196	TROI	We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
L539727	u2999	m196	RIKER	Report.
L539838	u3005	m196	WORF	Commander... we have a problem.
L539837	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	What the hell happened down there, Worf?
L539832	u3005	m196	WORF	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
L539831	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Worf? Is something wrong?
L539828	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
L539827	u3005	m196	WORF	Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
L539824	u3005	m196	WORF	There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
L539823	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Riker here.
L539822	u3005	m196	WORF	Worf to Bridge.
L539970	u3005	m196	WORF	What kind of message?
L539969	u3003	m196	TROI	They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
L539873	u3005	m196	WORF	Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
L539872	u3003	m196	TROI	Even Data?
L539725	u3005	m196	WORF	There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
L539724	u3003	m196	TROI	Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
L539632	u3005	m196	WORF	Target...
L539631	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
L539597	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
L539596	u3005	m196	WORF	No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
L538174	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
L538173	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
L538172	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
L538167	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
L538166	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
L538165	u3017	m197	PRESIDENT	Admiral Donald...Bill...
L538164	u3006	m197	ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President.
L538792	u3007	m197	BONES	That's the question -
L538791	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Or not to be -
L538749	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
L538748	u3007	m197	BONES	Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
L538747	u3007	m197	BONES	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
L538746	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
L538738	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We DO sleep lying down.
L538737	u3007	m197	BONES	Spock, that was actually funny.
L538736	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Vulcans sleep lying down...
L538735	u3007	m197	BONES	Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
L538731	u3007	m197	BONES	Fascinating...
L538730	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You may need assistance, doctor...
L538729	u3007	m197	BONES	I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
L538582	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The charge is murder.
L538581	u3007	m197	BONES	I believe the operation is over.
L538104	u3007	m197	BONES	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
L538103	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Good luck, Captain.
L538790	u3012	m197	KIRK	To be -
L538789	u3007	m197	BONES	And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
L538788	u3012	m197	KIRK	Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
L538557	u3012	m197	KIRK	Come on...
L538556	u3007	m197	BONES	ABSOLUTELY NOT!
L538545	u3012	m197	KIRK	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
L538544	u3007	m197	BONES	Damned clever if you ask me...
L538526	u3012	m197	KIRK	She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
L538525	u3007	m197	BONES	ARE YOU CRAZY?
L538515	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock's looking for us...
L538514	u3007	m197	BONES	If they're even looking for us...
L538513	u3012	m197	KIRK	Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
L538512	u3007	m197	BONES	That cunning little Vulcan...
L538511	u3012	m197	KIRK	It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
L538510	u3012	m197	KIRK	No way.  You see this?
L538509	u3007	m197	BONES	Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
L538489	u3012	m197	KIRK	Don't remind me.
L538488	u3007	m197	BONES	What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
L538470	u3007	m197	BONES	More than ever.
L538469	u3012	m197	KIRK	Still think we're finished?
L538468	u3007	m197	BONES	What is it with you, anyway?
L538456	u3007	m197	BONES	Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
L538455	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
L538454	u3007	m197	BONES	Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
L538453	u3012	m197	KIRK	No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
L538452	u3007	m197	BONES	Specifically of...?
L538451	u3012	m197	KIRK	Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
L538450	u3007	m197	BONES	Are we playing multiple choice?
L538449	u3012	m197	KIRK	I didn't mean this future.
L538448	u3007	m197	BONES	That was the general idea I intended to convey.
L538447	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bones, are you afraid of the future?
L538446	u3007	m197	BONES	- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
L538445	u3007	m197	BONES	Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
L538444	u3012	m197	KIRK	We're not finished.
L538443	u3007	m197	BONES	Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
L538432	u3007	m197	BONES	Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
L538431	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
L538396	u3012	m197	KIRK	We've been set up all along.

L538390	u3007	m197	BONES	What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
L538389	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thanks...
L538129	u3007	m197	BONES	Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
L538128	u3012	m197	KIRK	No!
L538125	u3007	m197	BONES	Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
L538124	u3012	m197	KIRK	Can you - ?
L538123	u3007	m197	BONES	Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
L538097	u3012	m197	KIRK	I wish I knew. Uhura?
L538096	u3007	m197	BONES	What the Hell's going on?
L537921	u3012	m197	KIRK	You heard the order, Lieutenant.
L537920	u3007	m197	BONES	Uh, Jim...
L538777	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
L538776	u3007	m197	BONES	They don't arrest people for having feelings.
L538722	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	In space, no one can hear you sweat.
L538721	u3007	m197	BONES	Too bad we can't SMELL her.
L538698	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
L538697	u3007	m197	BONES	This is fun...
L538672	u3007	m197	BONES	Now there's a poser.
L538671	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
L538031	u3007	m197	BONES	"Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of ""exploration""..."
L538030	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	We're explorers not diplomats!
L538010	u3007	m197	BONES	And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
L538009	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
L538283	u3008	m197	CHANG	The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
L538282	u3007	m197	BONES	I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
L538281	u3008	m197	CHANG	You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
L538280	u3007	m197	BONES	I was nervous -
L538277	u3008	m197	CHANG	You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
L538276	u3007	m197	BONES	I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
L538275	u3008	m197	CHANG	"Have you saved patients as ""barely"" alive as he was?"
L538274	u3007	m197	BONES	Barely.
L538273	u3008	m197	CHANG	Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
L538268	u3008	m197	CHANG	Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
L538267	u3007	m197	BONES	Retire.
L538266	u3008	m197	CHANG	Stand...?
L538265	u3007	m197	BONES	For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
L538264	u3007	m197	BONES	Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
L538263	u3008	m197	CHANG	Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
L538121	u3007	m197	BONES	Then let me help!
L538120	u3008	m197	CHANG	We were until your torpedoes!
L538119	u3007	m197	BONES	Are you carrying a surgeon?
L538523	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
L538522	u3007	m197	BONES	I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
L538521	u3014	m197	MARTIA	It takes a lot of effort.
L538427	u3007	m197	BONES	That's a comfort...
L538426	u3014	m197	MARTIA	They'll respect him now...
L538403	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
L538402	u3007	m197	BONES	What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
L538401	u3014	m197	MARTIA	They'll make it look like an accident...
L538400	u3007	m197	BONES	I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
L538324	u3008	m197	CHANG	Your honors, the State rests.
L538323	u3012	m197	KIRK	As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
L538320	u3008	m197	CHANG	So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
L538319	u3012	m197	KIRK	I am.
L538318	u3008	m197	CHANG	Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
L538317	u3012	m197	KIRK	I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
L538316	u3008	m197	CHANG	You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
L538315	u3012	m197	KIRK	Well, I -
L538314	u3008	m197	CHANG	You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
L538311	u3008	m197	CHANG	And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
L538310	u3012	m197	KIRK	I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
L538309	u3008	m197	CHANG	For insubordination.
L538308	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes.
L538307	u3008	m197	CHANG	You were demoted...
L538296	u3012	m197	KIRK	Those words WERE spoken by me.
L538295	u3008	m197	CHANG	Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
L538294	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes...
L538293	u3008	m197	CHANG	Spoken by you?
L538292	u3012	m197	KIRK	Yes.
L538291	u3008	m197	CHANG	Are those your words?
L538286	u3008	m197	CHANG	That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
L538285	u3012	m197	KIRK	That isn't true...!
L538284	u3008	m197	CHANG	And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
L538250	u3012	m197	KIRK	That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
L538249	u3008	m197	CHANG	And what did they tell you?
L538248	u3012	m197	KIRK	I checked the data banks, yes.
L538247	u3008	m197	CHANG	Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
L538246	u3012	m197	KIRK	There... were no other ships in the sector.
L538245	u3008	m197	CHANG	And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
L538244	u3012	m197	KIRK	The drink WAS served...
L538243	u3008	m197	CHANG	Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
L538242	u3012	m197	KIRK	What?
L538136	u3008	m197	CHANG	Take them away.
L538135	u3012	m197	KIRK	He just tried to save him!
L538134	u3008	m197	CHANG	Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
L538118	u3008	m197	CHANG	How can I trust --
L538117	u3012	m197	KIRK	He's a DOCTOR!
L538115	u3008	m197	CHANG	You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
L538114	u3012	m197	KIRK	WHAT HAPPENED?
L538113	u3008	m197	CHANG	You feign ignorance?
L538112	u3012	m197	KIRK	My God, what happened here?
L538001	u3012	m197	KIRK	I beg your pardon?
L538000	u3008	m197	CHANG	To be or not to be, that is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
L537992	u3008	m197	CHANG	Very much.
L537991	u3012	m197	KIRK	Would you care to go topside?
L537981	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm not sure how to take that.
L537980	u3008	m197	CHANG	I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
L538794	u3012	m197	KIRK	Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
L538793	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Course heading, Captain?
L538733	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...
L538732	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
L538692	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...
L538691	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
L538690	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Shields up. Battle stations.
L538689	u3012	m197	KIRK	Shields. Battle stations.
L538686	u3012	m197	KIRK	Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
L538685	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	But if she's cloaked...
L538684	u3012	m197	KIRK	She's here - somewhere.
L538624	u3012	m197	KIRK	She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
L538623	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Where IS the conference?
L538604	u3012	m197	KIRK	Who else?
L538603	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	From Starfleet?
L538570	u3012	m197	KIRK	First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
L538569	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	"Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on ""Stun"" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body..."
L538090	u3012	m197	KIRK	Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
L538089	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
L538069	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, monitor!
L538068	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Torpedo room--?
L538065	u3012	m197	KIRK	I know what you mean...
L538064	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Just the size of my head -
L537994	u3012	m197	KIRK	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
L537993	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
L537864	u3012	m197	KIRK	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
L537863	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Where is Mr. Sulu?
L538584	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	She programmed the torpedo hits?
L538583	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
L538499	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
L538498	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
L538476	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	ALL uniforms?
L538475	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
L538474	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Now we go to Starfleet?
L538473	u3020	m197	SPOCK	This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
L538472	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
L538471	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Klingon blood.
L538369	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You tell them, Lieutenant.
L538368	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
L538367	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
L538083	u3009	m197	CHEKOV	Shields up, Captain --?
L538082	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're preparing to fire.
L538298	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
L538297	u3021	m197	SULU	"Send to commander Enterprise: ""We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior."" Attach our co-ordinates."
L537857	u3021	m197	SULU	Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
L537856	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Do we report this, sir?
L537855	u3021	m197	SULU	An INCIDENT?
L537852	u3021	m197	SULU	Onscreen.
L537851	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
L537845	u3021	m197	SULU	Mr. Valtane, any more data?
L537844	u3010	m197	COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Aye, sir.
L538037	u3012	m197	KIRK	We must do this again soon.
L538036	u3011	m197	GORKON	Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
L537990	u3011	m197	GORKON	This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
L537989	u3012	m197	KIRK	Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
L537988	u3011	m197	GORKON	Your research laboratory is most impressive...
L537978	u3011	m197	GORKON	Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
L537977	u3012	m197	KIRK	Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
L537967	u3011	m197	GORKON	I shall look forward to it.
L537966	u3012	m197	KIRK	We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
L537965	u3011	m197	GORKON	We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
L537964	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
L537963	u3011	m197	GORKON	Thank you, Captain.
L537962	u3012	m197	KIRK	Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
L537961	u3011	m197	GORKON	This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
L538542	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not me, idiot - HIM!
L538541	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Kill him! He's the one!!
L538540	u3012	m197	KIRK	What took you so long?
L538539	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	I like it here...
L538538	u3012	m197	KIRK	Isn't it about time you became something else?
L538534	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	They'll be here...
L538533	u3012	m197	KIRK	Your friends are late...
L538531	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
L538530	u3012	m197	KIRK	An accident wasn't good enough...
L538520	u3015	m197	MARTIA'S VOICE	Give a girl a chance, Captain.
L538519	u3012	m197	KIRK	"I've heard of chameloids - ""Shapeshifters"" - I thought you were mythical."
L538466	u3012	m197	KIRK	Candidate for what?
L538465	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
L538464	u3012	m197	KIRK	Possibly.
L538463	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
L538462	u3012	m197	KIRK	Where do we come in?
L538461	u3014	m197	MARTIA	I know how to get outside the shield.
L538460	u3014	m197	MARTIA	It IS possible.
L538459	u3012	m197	KIRK	Except us.
L538458	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
L538434	u3012	m197	KIRK	There's gotta be a way out of this place...
L538433	u3014	m197	MARTIA	When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
L538430	u3012	m197	KIRK	Anything else you want to tell me?
L538429	u3014	m197	MARTIA	That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
L538405	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
L538404	u3012	m197	KIRK	How much time's left of your sentence?
L538399	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
L538398	u3012	m197	KIRK	We didn't kill Gorkon.
L538397	u3014	m197	MARTIA	We don't get many presidential assassins.
L538394	u3014	m197	MARTIA	There's a reward for your death.
L538393	u3012	m197	KIRK	How did you know...?
L538387	u3014	m197	MARTIA	Krandog aranty.
L538386	u3012	m197	KIRK	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
L538385	u3014	m197	MARTIA	And your coat.
L538384	u3012	m197	KIRK	He's got it.
L538383	u3014	m197	MARTIA	He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
L538612	u3012	m197	KIRK	WHO ELSE...?
L538611	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	This is incredible -
L538095	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Aye, sir.
L538094	u3012	m197	KIRK	Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
L538093	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Captain, if --
L538092	u3012	m197	KIRK	Stand down your weapons.
L537975	u3012	m197	KIRK	Energize...
L537974	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
L538642	u3012	m197	KIRK	You hear that?
L538641	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Just the prototype.
L538600	u3012	m197	KIRK	Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
L538599	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
L538598	u3012	m197	KIRK	"Who is ""US?"""
L538085	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, signal our surrender.
L538084	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain, our shields -- !
L538063	u3012	m197	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
L538062	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sir?
L538061	u3012	m197	KIRK	Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
L537969	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain.
L537968	u3012	m197	KIRK	I hope you're happy.
L537958	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
L537957	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
L537942	u3012	m197	KIRK	Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
L537941	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I always wanted to try that.
L537940	u3012	m197	KIRK	You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
L537939	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
L537937	u3012	m197	KIRK	Right -
L537936	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
L537935	u3012	m197	KIRK	Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
L537934	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sorry -
L537930	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L537929	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
L537928	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Kronos, sir?
L537927	u3012	m197	KIRK	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
L537926	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L537919	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
L537918	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
L537917	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Aft thrusters -
L537901	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
L537900	u3012	m197	KIRK	As you were. Lieutenant...?
L538647	u3021	m197	SULU	Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
L538646	u3012	m197	KIRK	Thank you, Captain Sulu.
L538645	u3021	m197	SULU	According to my information, today.
L538644	u3012	m197	KIRK	When does this conference start?
L538643	u3021	m197	SULU	I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
L538640	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
L538639	u3021	m197	SULU	Surely not.
L538638	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
L538637	u3021	m197	SULU	The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
L538636	u3012	m197	KIRK	Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
L538635	u3021	m197	SULU	I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
L538634	u3012	m197	KIRK	You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
L538633	u3021	m197	SULU	Standing by, Captain Kirk.
L538632	u3012	m197	KIRK	Sulu!
L538631	u3021	m197	SULU	This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
L538779	u3020	m197	SPOCK	... is to trust him.
L538778	u3012	m197	KIRK	The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
L538769	u3012	m197	KIRK	Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
L538768	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
L538767	u3012	m197	KIRK	"But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - ""the undiscovered country""..."
L538704	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
L538703	u3012	m197	KIRK	What's she waiting for?
L538688	u3012	m197	KIRK	Make ourselves a target?
L538687	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
L538679	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Not yet... Section 4236...
L538678	u3012	m197	KIRK	Close enough to beam down?
L538667	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock, you want to know something?
L538666	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But I am not human. I am only -
L538665	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
L538664	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I SHOULD have been -
L538663	u3012	m197	KIRK	"Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter ""S."" You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -"
L538662	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
L538661	u3012	m197	KIRK	Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
L538660	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
L538659	u3012	m197	KIRK	You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
L538658	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
L538657	u3012	m197	KIRK	I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
L538656	u3012	m197	KIRK	The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
L538655	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
L538654	u3012	m197	KIRK	Are you dining on worms?
L538629	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Commander is an old friend of yours.
L538628	u3012	m197	KIRK	Why would they give them to us?
L538627	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
L538620	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
L538619	u3012	m197	KIRK	What peace conference?
L538618	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The peace conference.
L538565	u3012	m197	KIRK	So, that's it..
L538564	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
L538553	u3012	m197	KIRK	He was just about to explain the whole damn -
L538552	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Captain...
L538102	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Perhaps you're right.
L538101	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
L538100	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
L538079	u3020	m197	SPOCK	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
L538078	u3012	m197	KIRK	We HAVEN'T fired -
L538067	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
L538066	u3012	m197	KIRK	What the -
L538060	u3012	m197	KIRK	From Enterprise?
L538059	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
L538058	u3012	m197	KIRK	Where?
L538057	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
L538056	u3012	m197	KIRK	Spock, I'm really tired...
L538055	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am uncertain.
L538054	u3012	m197	KIRK	What is it?
L538048	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
L538047	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
L538013	u3012	m197	KIRK	Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
L538012	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
L537956	u3020	m197	SPOCK	The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
L537955	u3012	m197	KIRK	Never been this close.
L537903	u3012	m197	KIRK	Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
L537902	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
L537892	u3012	m197	KIRK	LET THEM DIE.
L537891	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're dying.
L537890	u3012	m197	KIRK	DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
L537889	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
L537888	u3012	m197	KIRK	I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
L537887	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I was asked by my father to open neg-
L537886	u3012	m197	KIRK	How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
L537885	u3020	m197	SPOCK	There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
L537884	u3012	m197	KIRK	WE volunteered?
L537881	u3012	m197	KIRK	You have personally -
L537880	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
L537878	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
L537877	u3012	m197	KIRK	Me?
L538720	u3012	m197	KIRK	Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
L538719	u3022	m197	UHURA	Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
L538694	u3022	m197	UHURA	Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
L538693	u3012	m197	KIRK	Uhura?
L538608	u3012	m197	KIRK	Who else?
L538607	u3022	m197	UHURA	Gorkon's own man??
L538099	u3012	m197	KIRK	I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
L538098	u3022	m197	UHURA	It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
L538088	u3022	m197	UHURA	This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
L538087	u3012	m197	KIRK	WE SURRENDER.
L538086	u3022	m197	UHURA	Captain --
L537960	u3012	m197	KIRK	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
L537959	u3022	m197	UHURA	Channel open, Captain.
L537912	u3012	m197	KIRK	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
L537911	u3022	m197	UHURA	Control tower, reading, Sir.
L538595	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
L538594	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
L538588	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	You can't prove any of this...
L538587	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
L538579	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe you. Please...
L538578	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I don't want to.
L538577	u3020	m197	SPOCK	If you are logical.
L538421	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An error.
L538420	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
L538413	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
L538412	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
L538408	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
L538407	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
L538406	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Any progress?
L538233	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An omission. After that -
L538232	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
L538231	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
L538230	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
L538229	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
L538228	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Not as yet, sir.
L538227	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
L538224	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Such things have happened before, sir.
L538223	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Her own father...?
L538146	u3020	m197	SPOCK	In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
L538145	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	How did you - ?
L538142	u3020	m197	SPOCK	What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
L538141	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
L537951	u3020	m197	SPOCK	That the universe will unfold as it should.
L537950	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Faith...?
L537949	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You must have faith.
L537946	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
L537945	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
L537944	u3020	m197	SPOCK	You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
L538622	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
L538621	u3022	m197	UHURA	We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
L538186	u3022	m197	UHURA	We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
L538185	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
L538184	u3022	m197	UHURA	We've been ordered to -
L538183	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Trouble?
L538071	u3022	m197	UHURA	Confirmed, Captain!
L538070	u3013	m197	LT. SAAVIK	Direct hit -
L538442	u3016	m197	OFFICER	No, sir.
L538441	u3021	m197	SULU	You having hearing problems, mister?
L538440	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Sir?
L538439	u3021	m197	SULU	Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
L538438	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
L538437	u3021	m197	SULU	What?
L538436	u3016	m197	OFFICER	Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
L537850	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	What's left of it.
L537849	u3021	m197	SULU	Praxis?
L537848	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
L537847	u3021	m197	SULU	What is it?
L537846	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
L537843	u3021	m197	SULU	"Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: ""This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"""
L537842	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
L537841	u3021	m197	SULU	Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
L537829	u3021	m197	SULU	Visual!
L537828	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
L537827	u3021	m197	SULU	Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
L537826	u3018	m197	SCIENCE OFFICER	Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
L537825	u3021	m197	SULU	According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
L538497	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Aye, aye, sir.
L538496	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
L538419	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
L538418	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	- could take weeks, sir.
L538359	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I believe I am.
L538358	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
L538357	u3020	m197	SPOCK	This one can.
L538356	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
L538353	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Would they?
L538352	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
L538351	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
L538348	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Not from us!
L538347	u3020	m197	SPOCK	There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
L538346	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
L538235	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I know precisely where he'll be.
L538234	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
L538226	u3020	m197	SPOCK	That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
L538225	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
L538220	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Then someone forged a data bank entry.
L538219	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	And if they're still in place?
L538218	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Nevertheless.
L538217	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	That could take hours!
L538216	u3020	m197	SPOCK	We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
L538215	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
L538214	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I think  not.
L538213	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	A computer canna lie, sir.
L538212	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
L538211	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
L538148	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
L538147	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	NO WAY!
L538144	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
L538143	u3019	m197	SCOTTY	At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
L538775	u3020	m197	SPOCK	But you didn't join a conspiracy.
L538774	u3022	m197	UHURA	They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
L538728	u3022	m197	UHURA	Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
L538727	u3020	m197	SPOCK	"Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it ""Plasma"" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas."
L538725	u3022	m197	UHURA	Maybe we should write them a letter?
L538724	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
L538425	u3020	m197	SPOCK	At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
L538424	u3022	m197	UHURA	You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
L538416	u3020	m197	SPOCK	Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
L538415	u3022	m197	UHURA	I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
L538364	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
L538363	u3022	m197	UHURA	Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
L538362	u3020	m197	SPOCK	And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
L538345	u3020	m197	SPOCK	It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
L538344	u3022	m197	UHURA	What exactly does that mean?
L538343	u3020	m197	SPOCK	An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
L538301	u3020	m197	SPOCK	He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
L538300	u3022	m197	UHURA	Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
L538140	u3022	m197	UHURA	Yes, sir.
L538139	u3020	m197	SPOCK	I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
L538008	u3022	m197	UHURA	How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
L538007	u3020	m197	SPOCK	They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
L540855	u3023	m198	B-9	How long is that?
L540854	u3025	m198	DATA	Indefinitely.
L540853	u3023	m198	B-9	For how long?
L540852	u3025	m198	DATA	No. I must deactivate you.
L540851	u3023	m198	B-9	No. Can I move now?
L540850	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
L540849	u3023	m198	B-9	No.
L540848	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
L540847	u3025	m198	DATA	I know.
L540846	u3023	m198	B-9	I do not understand.
L540845	u3025	m198	DATA	You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
L540844	u3023	m198	B-9	Why?
L540843	u3025	m198	DATA	Because you are dangerous.
L540842	u3023	m198	B-9	Why?
L540841	u3025	m198	DATA	No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
L540840	u3023	m198	B-9	Brother. I cannot move.
L540519	u3025	m198	DATA	Is that your final answer?
L540518	u3023	m198	B-9	No.
L540517	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
L540516	u3023	m198	B-9	No.
L540515	u3025	m198	DATA	Can you remember our father?
L540514	u3023	m198	B-9	I am in a room with lights.
L540513	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you know where you are?
L540449	u3025	m198	DATA	No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
L540448	u3023	m198	B-9	You are me.
L540447	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you know who I am?
L540445	u3023	m198	B-9	"I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the ?Talosians"" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the ?Pakleds"" took me from my homeworld. They are fat?"
L540444	u3025	m198	DATA	Yes, please continue.
L540443	u3023	m198	B-9	Fuzzy face is gone.
L540436	u3023	m198	B-9	"I was taken from my homeworld by people called the ""PakJeds."" They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the ""Bolians."" The ""Bolians"" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship..."
L540435	u3025	m198	DATA	Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
L541108	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	Soon then.  I?ll save the last dance for you.
L541107	u3031	m198	PICARD	Not tonight, I have work here.
L541106	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
L541105	u3031	m198	PICARD	Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
L541104	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
L540878	u3031	m198	PICARD	How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
L540877	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	That was another time.
L540876	u3031	m198	PICARD	To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran?s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
L540869	u3031	m198	PICARD	I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
L540868	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
L540838	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
L540837	u3031	m198	PICARD	How long does he have?
L540832	u3031	m198	PICARD	Dying?
L540831	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
L540830	u3031	m198	PICARD	But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
L540829	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
L540729	u3031	m198	PICARD	Can you describe it, Deanna?
L540728	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
L540709	u3031	m198	PICARD	I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
L540708	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
L540705	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes.
L540704	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	Is he very much like you were?
L540703	u3031	m198	PICARD	I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
L540702	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	He turned out all right.
L540701	u3031	m198	PICARD	He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
L540700	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	He was a bit proud as I recall.
L540699	u3031	m198	PICARD	Remember him?
L540698	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	You're working late.
L540697	u3031	m198	PICARD	Beverly, come in.
L540694	u3031	m198	PICARD	Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
L540693	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
L540604	u3031	m198	PICARD	I think a skin cell?s the more likely of the two.
L540603	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
L540602	u3031	m198	PICARD	When was he... created?
L540269	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There?s no crying in Starfleet.
L540268	u3031	m198	PICARD	Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
L540267	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
L540264	u3024	m198	BEVERLY	It'll serve you right.
L540263	u3031	m198	PICARD	I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole? me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don?t show up for my physical on time!
L541055	u3025	m198	DATA	Sir.
L541054	u3031	m198	PICARD	Negative.
L541053	u3025	m198	DATA	Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
L541022	u3031	m198	PICARD	Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
L541021	u3025	m198	DATA	We are being hailed.
L541006	u3031	m198	PICARD	Divert power and compensate.
L541005	u3025	m198	DATA	Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
L540915	u3031	m198	PICARD	Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
L540914	u3025	m198	DATA	We are losing dorsal shields.
L540903	u3031	m198	PICARD	Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
L540902	u3025	m198	DATA	Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
L540901	u3031	m198	PICARD	It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
L540900	u3025	m198	DATA	We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
L540898	u3025	m198	DATA	I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
L540897	u3031	m198	PICARD	How can you be sure?
L540896	u3025	m198	DATA	No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
L540895	u3031	m198	PICARD	He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
L540894	u3025	m198	DATA	"He would deny a ""human"" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman."
L540893	u3031	m198	PICARD	But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
L540892	u3025	m198	DATA	I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
L540891	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes.
L540890	u3025	m198	DATA	Of you?
L540889	u3031	m198	PICARD	For now we see but through a glass darkly... He said he's a mirror.
L540888	u3025	m198	DATA	At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
L540887	u3031	m198	PICARD	How long until we reach the fleet?
L540811	u3031	m198	PICARD	Fire!
L540810	u3025	m198	DATA	Ready, Captain.
L540809	u3031	m198	PICARD	We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
L540808	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you think this is a wise course of action?
L540807	u3031	m198	PICARD	Well then... only one way to go.
L540806	u3025	m198	DATA	Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
L540805	u3031	m198	PICARD	Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
L540804	u3025	m198	DATA	Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
L540803	u3031	m198	PICARD	What do you imagine this is?
L540801	u3031	m198	PICARD	While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
L540800	u3025	m198	DATA	They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
L540799	u3031	m198	PICARD	Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
L540795	u3025	m198	DATA	There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
L540794	u3031	m198	PICARD	We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
L540793	u3025	m198	DATA	Yes, sir.
L540792	u3031	m198	PICARD	It'll only work for one of us.
L540791	u3025	m198	DATA	Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
L540790	u3025	m198	DATA	It would appear so.
L540789	u3031	m198	PICARD	A weapon.
L540787	u3025	m198	DATA	Aye, sir... This way.
L540786	u3031	m198	PICARD	A bit less florid, Data.
L540784	u3025	m198	DATA	He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
L540783	u3031	m198	PICARD	Good work. The download?
L540782	u3025	m198	DATA	My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
L540707	u3031	m198	PICARD	On my way.
L540706	u3025	m198	DATA	Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
L540503	u3031	m198	PICARD	Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
L540502	u3025	m198	DATA	Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
L540423	u3025	m198	DATA	Sorry, sir.
L540422	u3031	m198	PICARD	Data!
L540414	u3031	m198	PICARD	I can see that.
L540413	u3025	m198	DATA	He is very observant.
L540392	u3031	m198	PICARD	Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
L540391	u3025	m198	DATA	The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
L540383	u3031	m198	PICARD	Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
L540382	u3025	m198	DATA	The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
L540314	u3031	m198	PICARD	New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
L540313	u3025	m198	DATA	To new worlds...
L540312	u3031	m198	PICARD	Now, you make a toast.
L540311	u3025	m198	DATA	"If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would ""miss you."""
L540310	u3031	m198	PICARD	You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
L540309	u3025	m198	DATA	The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
L540307	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
L540306	u3025	m198	DATA	That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
L540305	u3031	m198	PICARD	Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
L540304	u3025	m198	DATA	"And this makes you ""sad""?"
L540303	u3031	m198	PICARD	Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
L540302	u3025	m198	DATA	And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
L540301	u3031	m198	PICARD	I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
L540300	u3025	m198	DATA	Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
L540299	u3025	m198	DATA	To happy endings.
L540298	u3031	m198	PICARD	So... To happy endings.
L540421	u3029	m198	HEAD	Why?
L540420	u3025	m198	DATA	Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
L540419	u3029	m198	HEAD	Why?
L540418	u3025	m198	DATA	This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
L540417	u3029	m198	HEAD	You have a red shirt.
L540401	u3029	m198	HEAD	You do not look like me.
L540400	u3025	m198	DATA	You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
L540399	u3029	m198	HEAD	Why am I looking at me?
L541061	u3025	m198	DATA	What is our approximate distance?
L540989	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Emergency force fields are holding.
L540988	u3025	m198	DATA	We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
L540530	u3025	m198	DATA	I am not.
L540529	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
L540528	u3025	m198	DATA	But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
L540527	u3025	m198	DATA	No, I do not mind.
L540526	u3028	m198	GEORDI	It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
L540525	u3025	m198	DATA	Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
L540524	u3028	m198	GEORDI	It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
L540523	u3025	m198	DATA	What purpose does this serve?
L540511	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
L540510	u3025	m198	DATA	Yes.
L540509	u3028	m198	GEORDI	An individual more like you, you mean.
L540508	u3025	m198	DATA	I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
L540507	u3028	m198	GEORDI	He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
L540506	u3025	m198	DATA	Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
L540505	u3028	m198	GEORDI	I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
L540504	u3025	m198	DATA	At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
L540430	u3025	m198	DATA	Do you have a name, sir?
L540429	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I?d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
L540375	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
L540374	u3025	m198	DATA	Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
L540360	u3025	m198	DATA	I thought only me, myself and Lore.
L540359	u3028	m198	GEORDI	How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
L540358	u3025	m198	DATA	Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
L540411	u3025	m198	DATA	Thank you.
L540410	u3037	m198	WORF	If you wouldn't mind.
L540403	u3025	m198	DATA	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
L540402	u3037	m198	WORF	No.
L540398	u3025	m198	DATA	The resemblance is... striking.
L540397	u3037	m198	WORF	It's you.
L540388	u3025	m198	DATA	Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
L540387	u3037	m198	WORF	Why is it moving?
L540386	u3025	m198	DATA	It appears to be...  ... an arm.
L541049	u3031	m198	PICARD	This isn't about me anymore.
L541048	u3026	m198	DEANNA	But how can he? He'll kill you.
L540994	u3031	m198	PICARD	Make it so.
L540993	u3026	m198	DEANNA	The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
L540992	u3031	m198	PICARD	Counselor?
L540991	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
L540864	u3031	m198	PICARD	I know how he thinks.
L540863	u3026	m198	DEANNA	How can you be certain?
L540732	u3031	m198	PICARD	Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
L540731	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
L540612	u3031	m198	PICARD	I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
L540611	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
L540610	u3031	m198	PICARD	How could I not?
L540609	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
L540608	u3026	m198	DEANNA	I don't know.
L540607	u3031	m198	PICARD	Is he sincere about wanting peace?
L540606	u3026	m198	DEANNA	I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
L540471	u3026	m198	DEANNA	And I you.
L540470	u3031	m198	PICARD	I'm going to miss you.
L540469	u3026	m198	DEANNA	I don't believe that, sir. We?ve shared many disappointing journeys.
L540468	u3031	m198	PICARD	As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
L540467	u3026	m198	DEANNA	The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
L540466	u3031	m198	PICARD	You're speaking of emotional investment?
L540465	u3026	m198	DEANNA	"It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a ""family"" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9."
L540464	u3031	m198	PICARD	Of course, sit down.
L540463	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Do you have a moment, sir?
L540462	u3031	m198	PICARD	Counselor.
L540289	u3026	m198	DEANNA	With pleasure, Captain.
L540288	u3031	m198	PICARD	May I have this dance?
L540281	u3031	m198	PICARD	The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
L540280	u3026	m198	DEANNA	And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
L540279	u3031	m198	PICARD	The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I?m a talking head.
L540278	u3026	m198	DEANNA	Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
L540714	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I can feel your desire, Deanna.
L540713	u3026	m198	DEANNA	No.
L540712	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
L540711	u3026	m198	DEANNA	You're not here.
L540625	u3026	m198	DEANNA	You sick bastard!
L540624	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
L540622	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
L540621	u3026	m198	DEANNA	This isn't real.
L540620	u3034	m198	SHINZON	He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
L540619	u3026	m198	DEANNA	No!
L540618	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Imzadi. This is so good.
L540570	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
L540569	u3026	m198	DEANNA	I'm only half human.
L541078	u3031	m198	PICARD	Thank you, Commander.
L541077	u3027	m198	DONATRA	This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
L541076	u3031	m198	PICARD	Open a channel.
L540987	u3031	m198	PICARD	Understood.
L540985	u3031	m198	PICARD	Do you have life support?
L540984	u3027	m198	DONATRA	I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
L540965	u3031	m198	PICARD	When this is over, I owe you a drink.
L540964	u3027	m198	DONATRA	The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
L540963	u3031	m198	PICARD	Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
L540962	u3027	m198	DONATRA	Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
L541081	u3031	m198	PICARD	Number One.  You have the bridge.
L541080	u3028	m198	GEORDI	I'll take care of it, sir.
L541079	u3031	m198	PICARD	Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
L541075	u3031	m198	PICARD	On screen.
L541074	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Sir, we're being hailed.
L541058	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Aye, sir.
L541057	u3031	m198	PICARD	You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
L541052	u3031	m198	PICARD	That's an order, Commander.
L541051	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Sir, we won?t be able to bring you back. It?s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
L541050	u3031	m198	PICARD	Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
L541047	u3028	m198	GEORDI	The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
L541046	u3031	m198	PICARD	How long until he can fire?
L541031	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Ready, sir!
L541030	u3031	m198	PICARD	Deanna, on my mark.
L541029	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Aye, sir.
L541028	u3031	m198	PICARD	Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
L541019	u3031	m198	PICARD	We?ve got him!
L541018	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Sir?
L541017	u3031	m198	PICARD	He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
L541016	u3031	m198	PICARD	He wants to look me in the eye.
L541015	u3028	m198	GEORDI	What's he doing?
L541012	u3031	m198	PICARD	What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
L541011	u3028	m198	GEORDI	He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
L540858	u3031	m198	PICARD	And that's exactly what he's going to do.
L540857	u3028	m198	GEORDI	It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
L540692	u3031	m198	PICARD	As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
L540691	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
L540690	u3031	m198	PICARD	I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
L540688	u3028	m198	GEORDI	There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
L540687	u3031	m198	PICARD	Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
L540686	u3028	m198	GEORDI	That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
L540685	u3031	m198	PICARD	What programs were accessed?
L540684	u3028	m198	GEORDI	It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
L540497	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
L540496	u3031	m198	PICARD	Cannon fodder.
L540373	u3031	m198	PICARD	What do we know about the population?
L540372	u3028	m198	GEORDI	I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
L540357	u3031	m198	PICARD	Theories?
L540356	u3028	m198	GEORDI	Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
L540355	u3031	m198	PICARD	What do we know about the planet?
L540354	u3028	m198	GEORDI	It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
L540487	u3030	m198	JANEWAY	Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
L540486	u3031	m198	PICARD	Just lucky, Admiral.
L540484	u3031	m198	PICARD	Not with the Romulans.
L540482	u3031	m198	PICARD	Understood.
L540481	u3030	m198	JANEWAY	 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
L540480	u3030	m198	JANEWAY	There's more... as always. He's Reman.
L540479	u3031	m198	PICARD	New Praetor?
L540478	u3030	m198	JANEWAY	A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
L540477	u3031	m198	PICARD	With or without the rest of the fleet?
L540475	u3031	m198	PICARD	Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
L540778	u3036	m198	VICEROY	I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
L540777	u3031	m198	PICARD	There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
L540776	u3036	m198	VICEROY	It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
L540775	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
L540774	u3031	m198	PICARD	That will never happen.
L540773	u3036	m198	VICEROY	I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
L540772	u3031	m198	PICARD	What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
L540771	u3036	m198	VICEROY	So, human... you've met your better self!
L540555	u3036	m198	VICEROY	I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
L540554	u3031	m198	PICARD	Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
L540553	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
L541118	u3037	m198	WORF	Your new chair, sir.
L541117	u3031	m198	PICARD	What's this?
L541089	u3031	m198	PICARD	On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
L541088	u3037	m198	WORF	Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
L540969	u3037	m198	WORF	Aye, sir.
L540968	u3031	m198	PICARD	Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
L540922	u3031	m198	PICARD	On screen.
L540921	u3037	m198	WORF	Sir, we're being hailed.
L540911	u3037	m198	WORF	Aye, sir
L540910	u3031	m198	PICARD	Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
L540683	u3031	m198	PICARD	Who was it?
L540682	u3037	m198	WORF	Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
L540552	u3031	m198	PICARD	On screen.
L540551	u3037	m198	WORF	We're being hailed.
L540548	u3037	m198	WORF	Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
L540547	u3031	m198	PICARD	Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
L540546	u3037	m198	WORF	Captain!
L540545	u3031	m198	PICARD	No!
L540539	u3031	m198	PICARD	Not yet, Mister Worf.
L540538	u3037	m198	WORF	Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
L540394	u3031	m198	PICARD	If you don't mind.
L540393	u3037	m198	WORF	To find the head, sir?
L540352	u3031	m198	PICARD	What sort of signature?
L540351	u3037	m198	WORF	I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
L540350	u3031	m198	PICARD	Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
L540349	u3037	m198	WORF	Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
L540348	u3031	m198	PICARD	Won?t do what, Mister Worf?
L540347	u3037	m198	WORF	I won't do it.
L541101	u3031	m198	PICARD	The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
L541100	u3033	m198	RIKER	Serving with you has been an honor.
L541099	u3033	m198	RIKER	I intend to.
L541098	u3031	m198	PICARD	When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
L541097	u3033	m198	RIKER	Anything.
L541096	u3031	m198	PICARD	I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
L541095	u3033	m198	RIKER	But she's not the Enterprise.
L541094	u3033	m198	RIKER	She's the most beautiful ship I?ve ever seen.
L541093	u3031	m198	PICARD	The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
L540920	u3031	m198	PICARD	Agreed.
L540919	u3033	m198	RIKER	Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
L540918	u3031	m198	PICARD	Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
L540907	u3033	m198	RIKER	He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
L540906	u3031	m198	PICARD	Report.
L540871	u3031	m198	PICARD	We can only hope so.
L540870	u3033	m198	RIKER	Strength in numbers?
L540862	u3031	m198	PICARD	And the Romulans invade.
L540861	u3033	m198	RIKER	Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
L540860	u3031	m198	PICARD	His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
L540859	u3033	m198	RIKER	Sir?
L540834	u3031	m198	PICARD	Can anything be done for him?
L540833	u3033	m198	RIKER	He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
L540557	u3031	m198	PICARD	Away team. Transporter room four.
L540556	u3033	m198	RIKER	Not very chatty.
L540550	u3031	m198	PICARD	She's a predator.
L540549	u3033	m198	RIKER	She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
L540541	u3031	m198	PICARD	Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
L540540	u3033	m198	RIKER	Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
L540536	u3031	m198	PICARD	Counselor?
L540535	u3033	m198	RIKER	It's working.
L540534	u3031	m198	PICARD	It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
L540533	u3033	m198	RIKER	Why don't they answer our hails?
L540500	u3033	m198	RIKER	The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
L540499	u3031	m198	PICARD	A coup d'etat?
L540498	u3033	m198	RIKER	We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
L540473	u3031	m198	PICARD	Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
L540472	u3033	m198	RIKER	Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
L540380	u3031	m198	PICARD	Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
L540379	u3033	m198	RIKER	Sir --
L540378	u3031	m198	PICARD	I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
L540377	u3033	m198	RIKER	Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
L540365	u3031	m198	PICARD	Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you?ll excuse me.  I?ll be in the gym.
L540364	u3033	m198	RIKER	Thank you, sir...
L540363	u3031	m198	PICARD	I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
L540362	u3031	m198	PICARD	Still well on our side...
L540361	u3033	m198	RIKER	Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
L541025	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
L541024	u3031	m198	PICARD	I am.
L541023	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
L540954	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
L540953	u3031	m198	PICARD	You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
L540952	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It?s too late.
L540951	u3031	m198	PICARD	Please.
L540950	u3034	m198	SHINZON	That's your life... not mine.
L540948	u3031	m198	PICARD	But you want to.
L540947	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I don't know.
L540946	u3031	m198	PICARD	So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
L540945	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Yes.
L540941	u3034	m198	SHINZON	He is what his life has made him!
L540940	u3031	m198	PICARD	The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
L540938	u3031	m198	PICARD	I see more than what you are.
L540937	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
L540936	u3031	m198	PICARD	Not so long.
L540935	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Long ago.
L540934	u3031	m198	PICARD	I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
L540933	u3031	m198	PICARD	Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
L540932	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
L540931	u3031	m198	PICARD	You know that's not possible.
L540930	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
L540929	u3031	m198	PICARD	And what of the Enterprise?
L540928	u3034	m198	SHINZON	To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
L540927	u3031	m198	PICARD	Why are you here?
L540926	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
L540925	u3031	m198	PICARD	We are.
L540924	u3034	m198	SHINZON	You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
L540759	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
L540758	u3031	m198	PICARD	I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
L540757	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It amazes me how little you know yourself.
L540756	u3031	m198	PICARD	Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
L540755	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
L540754	u3031	m198	PICARD	If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
L540753	u3034	m198	SHINZON	My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
L540752	u3031	m198	PICARD	I won't defend my life to you.
L540751	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
L540750	u3031	m198	PICARD	I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
L540749	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
L540748	u3031	m198	PICARD	You're not Reman.
L540747	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
L540746	u3031	m198	PICARD	What's this all about?
L540745	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I?ll snap its ugly head off.
L540742	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
L540741	u3031	m198	PICARD	All of this so you could capture me?
L540739	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
L540738	u3031	m198	PICARD	What are you doing?
L540736	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I was lonely...
L540735	u3031	m198	PICARD	Why am I here?
L540734	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Hello, Jean Luc.
L540676	u3031	m198	PICARD	In time.
L540675	u3034	m198	SHINZON	In time, Jean Luc.
L540674	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
L540673	u3031	m198	PICARD	If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
L540672	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I know.
L540671	u3031	m198	PICARD	Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
L540670	u3034	m198	SHINZON	There is that.
L540669	u3031	m198	PICARD	With a full head of hair.
L540668	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I always hoped I would hit two meters.
L540667	u3031	m198	PICARD	So I'm not as tall as you expected?
L540666	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Age before rank, Jean Luc.
L540665	u3031	m198	PICARD	After you, Praetor.
L540664	u3031	m198	PICARD	New worlds.
L540663	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
L540662	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes.
L540661	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Looking up at the stars.
L540660	u3031	m198	PICARD	No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
L540659	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Were we always explorers?
L540658	u3031	m198	PICARD	There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
L540657	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
L540656	u3034	m198	SHINZON	All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
L540655	u3031	m198	PICARD	And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
L540654	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you?d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
L540653	u3031	m198	PICARD	I have no reason to.
L540652	u3034	m198	SHINZON	You don't trust me.
L540651	u3034	m198	SHINZON	No race should be a slave to another.
L540650	u3031	m198	PICARD	You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
L540649	u3034	m198	SHINZON	For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
L540648	u3034	m198	SHINZON	They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
L540647	u3031	m198	PICARD	How did you end up on Remus?
L540646	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
L540645	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes. The eyes have it.
L540644	u3034	m198	SHINZON	A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
L540643	u3031	m198	PICARD	Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
L540642	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It's not quite the face you remember.
L540641	u3031	m198	PICARD	You'll acquire a taste for it.
L540640	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
L540639	u3034	m198	SHINZON	As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
L540638	u3031	m198	PICARD	What happened?
L540637	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
L540598	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I know.
L540597	u3031	m198	PICARD	You know I need to verify this.
L540596	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
L540595	u3031	m198	PICARD	We need to talk, just you and I.
L540590	u3031	m198	PICARD	You know I do.
L540589	u3034	m198	SHINZON	No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
L540587	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
L540586	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes.
L540585	u3034	m198	SHINZON	But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
L540584	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
L540583	u3031	m198	PICARD	Yes.
L540582	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Right now, you?re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
L540581	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I have dissolved the Senate.
L540580	u3031	m198	PICARD	And the Senate supports you?
L540579	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
L540578	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
L540577	u3031	m198	PICARD	I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
L540576	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
L540575	u3031	m198	PICARD	Praetor Shinzon. We?re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
L540574	u3034	m198	SHINZON	On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
L540573	u3031	m198	PICARD	Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
L540572	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
L540568	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I've never met a human woman.
L540567	u3031	m198	PICARD	Praetor?
L540562	u3034	m198	SHINZON	No?
L540561	u3031	m198	PICARD	And you're not as we imagined you.
L540559	u3031	m198	PICARD	Praetor Shinzon?
L540558	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
L541044	u3032	m198	REMAN OFFICER	But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
L541043	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Our greater goal is more important, brother.
L541042	u3032	m198	REMAN OFFICER	What about Picard?
L541041	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
L541040	u3032	m198	REMAN OFFICER	Disruptors are off-line, sir.
L541039	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Target disruptors. Destroy them.
L540958	u3032	m198	REMAN OFFICER	Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
L540957	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Report!
L540722	u3034	m198	SHINZON	On my way.
L540721	u3032	m198	REMAN OFFICER	Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
L541008	u3033	m198	RIKER	Let's go.
L541007	u3037	m198	WORF	Intruder alert!
L540960	u3037	m198	WORF	We're being hailed.
L540959	u3033	m198	RIKER	Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
L540917	u3033	m198	RIKER	Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
L540916	u3037	m198	WORF	Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
L540544	u3037	m198	WORF	Should I raise shields?
L540543	u3033	m198	RIKER	My God...
L540459	u3033	m198	RIKER	Runs in the family.
L540458	u3037	m198	WORF	He's a very unusual android.
L540457	u3033	m198	RIKER	So they?ve got him up and running.
L540456	u3037	m198	WORF	It is... invigorating.
L540455	u3033	m198	RIKER	Well, that sounds relaxing too.
L540999	u3036	m198	VICEROY	She is here.
L540998	u3034	m198	SHINZON	What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
L540982	u3034	m198	SHINZON	FULL STOP AND FIRE !
L540981	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Praetor...
L540977	u3034	m198	SHINZON	You heard me.
L540976	u3036	m198	VICEROY	What?!
L540975	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
L540885	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Seven minutes.
L540884	u3034	m198	SHINZON	How long until we reach the Rift?
L540882	u3036	m198	VICEROY	A matter of hours now.
L540881	u3034	m198	SHINZON	How long?
L540724	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
L540723	u3036	m198	VICEROY	It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
L540720	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Do as I tell you!
L540719	u3036	m198	VICEROY	No -- this is wasting time.
L540718	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Find her again.
L540717	u3036	m198	VICEROY	The bond is broken.
L540680	u3034	m198	SHINZON	My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
L540679	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
L540678	u3034	m198	SHINZON	He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
L540677	u3036	m198	VICEROY	This is a mistake.
L540339	u3036	m198	VICEROY	Yes, Praetor.
L540338	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Are we prepared?
L540821	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
L540820	u3035	m198	SURAN	For the moment.
L540819	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
L540818	u3035	m198	SURAN	And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
L540817	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
L540815	u3034	m198	SHINZON	The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
L540635	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Now go. I have some personal business.
L540634	u3035	m198	SURAN	Praetor.
L540633	u3034	m198	SHINZON	You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard?s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
L540632	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Silence, Romulan!
L540631	u3035	m198	SURAN	Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
L540630	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I have a purpose.
L540629	u3035	m198	SURAN	And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
L540628	u3034	m198	SHINZON	You don't have to understand.
L540627	u3035	m198	SURAN	Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
L540336	u3034	m198	SHINZON	I came this far alone ...
L540335	u3035	m198	SURAN	But surely...
L540334	u3034	m198	SHINZON	The Scimitar will serve my needs.
L540333	u3035	m198	SURAN	Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
L540332	u3034	m198	SHINZON	None.
L540331	u3035	m198	SURAN	How many Warbirds will you need?
L540325	u3034	m198	SHINZON	It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
L540324	u3035	m198	SURAN	They will obey, Praetor.
L540323	u3034	m198	SHINZON	And?
L540322	u3035	m198	SURAN	They're holding position.
L540321	u3034	m198	SHINZON	Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
L542546	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
L542545	u3038	m199	BENNY	I don't think so... 
L542544	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
L542533	u3047	m199	OFFICER	No, we can handle this.
L542532	u3038	m199	BENNY	Don't you think you should call a backup?
L542530	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Probably kids.
L542529	u3038	m199	BENNY	What did I tell you?
L542526	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
L542525	u3038	m199	BENNY	There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
L542524	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, there's nothing there.
L542523	u3038	m199	BENNY	It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
L542522	u3047	m199	OFFICER	I don't see anything.
L542521	u3038	m199	BENNY	Right in line with that burning tree.
L542517	u3038	m199	BENNY	I don't want to scare them away.
L542516	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, God, take it easy...
L543352	u3039	m199	CLERK	We should have. Let me see.
L543351	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
L543094	u3039	m199	CLERK	It's still the full price.
L543093	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're only going to be here a few hours...
L543092	u3039	m199	CLERK	I'll have to run your card off now.
L543091	u3043	m199	JENNY	Credit card.
L543090	u3039	m199	CLERK	Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
L543089	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'll take that.
L543088	u3039	m199	CLERK	Sure.
L543087	u3043	m199	JENNY	You have one with two beds?
L543086	u3039	m199	CLERK	Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
L543085	u3043	m199	JENNY	How much are your rooms?
L543084	u3039	m199	CLERK	What can I do for you folks?
L542956	u3039	m199	CLERK	Have a nice trip.
L542955	u3043	m199	JENNY	Thank you.
L542954	u3039	m199	CLERK	Gate three. It's boarding now.
L543242	u3040	m199	COOK	And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
L543241	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Thank you.
L543240	u3040	m199	COOK	Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
L543182	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It is beautiful.
L543181	u3040	m199	COOK	What do you think of America?
L543180	u3040	m199	COOK	They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
L543179	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543178	u3040	m199	COOK	Do you have children?
L543173	u3040	m199	COOK	You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
L543172	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543171	u3040	m199	COOK	Make any money?
L543170	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Eh... yes.
L543169	u3040	m199	COOK	Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
L543168	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I make maps.
L543167	u3040	m199	COOK	What do you do?
L543166	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543165	u3040	m199	COOK	Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
L543152	u3041	m199	DRIVER	About five miles back.
L543151	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where's that?
L543150	u3041	m199	DRIVER	Elmo's...
L543149	u3043	m199	JENNY	What was your last stop?
L543148	u3041	m199	DRIVER	Stay right there...
L543147	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you stop last?
L543146	u3041	m199	DRIVER	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L543145	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you stop last?
L543117	u3041	m199	DRIVER	He's got a gun!!
L543116	u3043	m199	JENNY	No!!! No!!!
L542621	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	They must have picked it up in space.
L542620	u3042	m199	FOX	Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
L542619	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
L542618	u3042	m199	FOX	Recognize this?
L542590	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
L542589	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
L542588	u3042	m199	FOX	We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
L543433	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin!! Shermin!!!
L543432	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I just retired.
L543431	u3042	m199	FOX	What?
L543430	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George... Do you hear me, George?
L543413	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
L543412	u3042	m199	FOX	No deal.
L543347	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
L543346	u3042	m199	FOX	You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
L543345	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Then you're going to have to do it without me.
L543344	u3042	m199	FOX	No, we don't.
L543343	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	That's the chance we have to take.
L543342	u3042	m199	FOX	We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
L543341	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
L543340	u3042	m199	FOX	You're not hearing me.
L543339	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
L543338	u3042	m199	FOX	Washington thinks it's too late for that.
L543337	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
L543336	u3042	m199	FOX	We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
L543335	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	What's all this for?
L543334	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin...
L543333	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hello George.
L543140	u3042	m199	FOX	You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
L543139	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
L543138	u3042	m199	FOX	Is that what's affecting your performance?
L543137	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
L543136	u3042	m199	FOX	So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
L543135	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
L543134	u3042	m199	FOX	I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
L543133	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
L543132	u3042	m199	FOX	We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
L542889	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
L542888	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
L542887	u3042	m199	FOX	We don't know what else to do. We need results.
L542886	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
L542885	u3042	m199	FOX	Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
L542884	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I don't like it, George...
L542883	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
L542882	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
L542756	u3042	m199	FOX	Oh shit!!!
L542755	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
L542753	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
L542752	u3042	m199	FOX	Clarify that.
L542751	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's taken on a disguise.
L542750	u3042	m199	FOX	Why did you let it get into a populated area?
L542747	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
L542746	u3042	m199	FOX	It's in a green Mustang?
L542745	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
L542744	u3042	m199	FOX	When can we expect containment?
L542743	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
L542629	u3042	m199	FOX	You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
L542628	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
L542627	u3042	m199	FOX	We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
L542626	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
L542625	u3042	m199	FOX	We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
L542624	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
L542623	u3042	m199	FOX	We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
L542622	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Then it's not an accident that they found us.
L542595	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	What do you mean by 'contain?'
L542594	u3042	m199	FOX	Contain it and get back to me.
L542593	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
L542592	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
L542591	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
L542587	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Neither did I.
L542586	u3042	m199	FOX	Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
L542585	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
L542584	u3042	m199	FOX	Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
L542583	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
L542582	u3042	m199	FOX	There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
L542581	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's real, George.
L543428	u3042	m199	FOX	Watch it. They're coming out.
L543427	u3043	m199	JENNY	I won't let anyone hurt you.
L543402	u3042	m199	FOX	Okay...
L543401	u3043	m199	JENNY	If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
L543400	u3042	m199	FOX	You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
L543399	u3043	m199	JENNY	I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
L543398	u3042	m199	FOX	This is George Fox...
L543397	u3042	m199	FOX	Mrs. Haydn...
L543224	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
L543223	u3043	m199	JENNY	He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
L543222	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Mrs. Haydn...
L543221	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
L543220	u3043	m199	JENNY	Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
L543219	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Marc Shermin.
L543218	u3043	m199	JENNY	Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
L543215	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Get a highway patrol unit over there.
L543214	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
L543213	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
L543211	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
L543210	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
L543209	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
L543208	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
L543447	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Goodbye.
L543446	u3043	m199	JENNY	I will.
L543445	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Tell the baby about me.
L543443	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543442	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
L543441	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I love you.
L543440	u3043	m199	JENNY	You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
L543439	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What do I do now?
L543438	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must go.
L543437	u3043	m199	JENNY	Well...
L543417	u3043	m199	JENNY	I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
L543416	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
L543415	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where do you think you're going?
L543393	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will wave to you.
L543392	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
L543391	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The yellow one.
L543390	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where?
L543389	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	There.
L543386	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No, thank you.
L543385	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
L543383	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Many, many days and nights...
L543382	u3043	m199	JENNY	How long will it take you to get home?
L543381	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543380	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You want the baby to laugh at me.
L543379	u3043	m199	JENNY	Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
L543378	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd like to...
L543377	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If you want to keep it, you can.
L543376	u3043	m199	JENNY	This is yours...
L543375	u3043	m199	JENNY	We can.
L543374	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will say that we can be friends.
L543373	u3043	m199	JENNY	What will you say about us?
L543372	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
L543371	u3043	m199	JENNY	It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
L543370	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543369	u3043	m199	JENNY	Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
L543368	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
L543367	u3043	m199	JENNY	It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
L543366	u3043	m199	JENNY	If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
L543365	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L543364	u3043	m199	JENNY	The cook again?
L543363	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
L543362	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
L543361	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to get money for you and the baby.
L543360	u3043	m199	JENNY	You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
L543359	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I know how to gamble now.
L543358	u3043	m199	JENNY	This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
L543357	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.  Thank you.
L543356	u3043	m199	JENNY	Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
L543355	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to gamble.
L543354	u3043	m199	JENNY	What for?
L543353	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	May I have twenty-five cents, please?
L543350	u3043	m199	JENNY	You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
L543349	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
L543331	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
L543330	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
L543329	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
L543328	u3043	m199	JENNY	But...
L543327	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
L543326	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes, they are.
L543325	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	They are beautiful.
L543324	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I gave you a baby last night.
L543323	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, you're pretty...
L543322	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543321	u3043	m199	JENNY	No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
L543320	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Do they talk?!
L543319	u3043	m199	JENNY	Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
L543318	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543317	u3043	m199	JENNY	You don't forget anything, do you?
L543316	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Horses.
L543315	u3043	m199	JENNY	Good morning.
L543314	u3043	m199	JENNY	Nothing.
L543313	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L543309	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not get cold.
L543308	u3043	m199	JENNY	You're damn right I am.
L543307	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You are cold.
L543305	u3043	m199	JENNY	We'll get a ride in the morning.
L543304	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
L543303	u3043	m199	JENNY	Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
L543302	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
L543301	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
L543299	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
L543298	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You can stop. I will go on alone.
L543297	u3043	m199	JENNY	What are you saying?
L543296	u3043	m199	JENNY	What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
L543295	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You promised.
L543294	u3043	m199	JENNY	I will. I will. We still have another day.
L543293	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You promised you would get me to my ship.
L543292	u3043	m199	JENNY	No one's traveling in this weather.
L543291	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I can't stay on this planet.
L543290	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're not going to get a ride tonight.
L543289	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The cook.
L543288	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you learn that?
L543287	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Asshole!!
L543285	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
L543284	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I feel better if I move.
L543283	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why can't we wait here for a ride?
L543282	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must meet my ship.
L543281	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where are you going?
L543275	u3043	m199	JENNY	Come on.
L543274	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't want you to be hurt.
L543273	u3043	m199	JENNY	You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
L543272	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will go. But not you.
L543271	u3043	m199	JENNY	Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
L543270	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
L543269	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
L543268	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
L543267	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
L543266	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
L543113	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
L543112	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Are you angry at me?
L543111	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
L543110	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You can have one.
L543109	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. Get in.
L543108	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
L543107	u3043	m199	JENNY	Hurry up.
L543106	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	On the radio they say it's good.
L543105	u3043	m199	JENNY	You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
L543097	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
L543096	u3043	m199	JENNY	Put that back.
L543083	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes. Sing some more.
L543082	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You liked my singing?
L543081	u3043	m199	JENNY	That was beautiful.
L543080	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am not a good singer.
L543078	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
L543077	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not want to.
L543076	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
L543075	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L543074	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you have music up there?
L543073	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
L543072	u3043	m199	JENNY	I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
L543071	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I like this music.
L543070	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know.
L543069	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L543068	u3043	m199	JENNY	Nobody knows.
L543065	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am your friend.
L543064	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543063	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Are you my friend?
L543062	u3043	m199	JENNY	What are you doing?
L543061	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	He will.
L543060	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's bad.
L543059	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What is hell?
L543058	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
L543057	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543056	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
L543055	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
L543054	u3043	m199	JENNY	A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
L543053	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand 'friend.'
L543052	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
L543051	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
L543050	u3043	m199	JENNY	The captain...
L543049	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
L543048	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543047	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes?
L543046	u3043	m199	JENNY	You did? That's funny. So did we.
L543045	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
L543044	u3043	m199	JENNY	Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
L543043	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
L543042	u3043	m199	JENNY	You thought we were a different planet?!
L543041	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It was a mistake.
L543040	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
L543015	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I was afraid.
L543014	u3043	m199	JENNY	What happened?
L543011	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
L543010	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L543009	u3043	m199	JENNY	Goodbye.
L543005	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Please stay.
L543004	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes?
L543003	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Jennyhaydn.
L543002	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Goodbye.
L543001	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
L543000	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Go?
L542999	u3043	m199	JENNY	Well... I'm going to go now.
L542998	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542997	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
L542995	u3043	m199	JENNY	No.
L542994	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Can I have the gun?
L542993	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
L542991	u3043	m199	JENNY	Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
L542990	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
L542989	u3043	m199	JENNY	Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
L542988	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The car will stop?
L542987	u3043	m199	JENNY	Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
L542986	u3043	m199	JENNY	You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
L542985	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
L542982	u3043	m199	JENNY	Then don't be smart.
L542981	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542980	u3043	m199	JENNY	You want this ticket?
L542979	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
L542978	u3043	m199	JENNY	Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
L542977	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not speak English.
L542976	u3043	m199	JENNY	Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
L542975	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I speak English.
L542974	u3043	m199	JENNY	The driver will...
L542973	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
L542972	u3043	m199	JENNY	Say it.
L542971	u3043	m199	JENNY	That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
L542970	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What is hitchhike?
L542969	u3043	m199	JENNY	I know that. But the buses don't go there.
L542968	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I must go here.
L542967	u3043	m199	JENNY	I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
L542966	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L542965	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
L542964	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L542963	u3043	m199	JENNY	No... The closest...
L542962	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Do you have a baby?
L542961	u3043	m199	JENNY	Eh... yes...
L542960	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	A baby is a new person?
L542959	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L542958	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Is that a baby?
L542957	u3043	m199	JENNY	The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
L542930	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	When we get here.
L542929	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
L542928	u3043	m199	JENNY	I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
L542927	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542926	u3043	m199	JENNY	Then let me go. You don't need me.
L542925	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542924	u3043	m199	JENNY	You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
L542923	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542922	u3043	m199	JENNY	I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
L542921	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I need you.
L542920	u3043	m199	JENNY	That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
L542919	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Three nights... two days.
L542918	u3043	m199	JENNY	How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
L542917	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes. Day... night.
L542916	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
L542915	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542914	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sun...
L542913	u3043	m199	JENNY	How will I do this one?...
L542912	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not understand.
L542911	u3043	m199	JENNY	When do you have to be here?
L542910	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
L542909	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why are you going here? What is here?
L542908	u3043	m199	JENNY	You better.
L542907	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will see it next time.
L542906	u3043	m199	JENNY	You didn't even see it.
L542905	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It was yellow.
L542904	u3043	m199	JENNY	That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
L542878	u3043	m199	JENNY	Music.
L542877	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L542876	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Horses.
L542875	u3043	m199	JENNY	Horses.
L542867	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit!
L542866	u3043	m199	JENNY	What's the matter?
L542863	u3043	m199	JENNY	This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
L542862	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to try it.
L542861	u3043	m199	JENNY	You want to try it?
L542860	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I...
L542859	u3043	m199	JENNY	A drink.

L542833	u3043	m199	JENNY	Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
L542826	u3043	m199	JENNY	Okay.
L542825	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You. Mouth closed.

L542822	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
L542821	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542820	u3043	m199	JENNY	Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
L542819	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Who?
L542816	u3043	m199	JENNY	Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
L542815	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit... shit... what shit?
L542814	u3043	m199	JENNY	No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
L542813	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit?
L542812	u3043	m199	JENNY	Shit.
L542811	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
L542810	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am husband?
L542809	u3043	m199	JENNY	My... husband.
L542808	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Who?

L542803	u3043	m199	JENNY	Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
L542802	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Space?
L542801	u3043	m199	JENNY	Are you from up there? Space?
L542800	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	From?

L542695	u3043	m199	JENNY	He's kidnapping me!!!
L542694	u3046	m199	MAN	You could have killed us both!!
L542693	u3043	m199	JENNY	Help me!!
L543264	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't worry. I'll be all right.
L543263	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
L543262	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sure.
L543261	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Wait. Could I have your autograph?
L543260	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
L543259	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
L543258	u3043	m199	JENNY	Pull over. I've got to get back there.
L543257	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
L543256	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Fly.
L543255	u3043	m199	JENNY	If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
L543254	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
L543239	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
L543238	u3043	m199	JENNY	What? No, of course not.
L543237	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	They after you?
L543236	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
L543235	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know where he is.
L543234	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	In the cars, too?!
L543233	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you I'm looking for someone.
L543232	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
L543231	u3043	m199	JENNY	Slow down, slow down.
L543230	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	My grandmother's rich.
L543229	u3043	m199	JENNY	You sure this is your car?
L543249	u3044	m199	LYMAN	We're ready.
L543248	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You get that, Lyman?
L543130	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I did.
L543129	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Tell him I'm not here.
L543039	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
L543038	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Doesn't make sense.
L543037	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
L542899	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
L542898	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
L542897	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
L542612	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
L542611	u3044	m199	LYMAN	That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
L542609	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Give it a rest, Lyman.
L542608	u3044	m199	LYMAN	This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
L542602	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
L542601	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
L542580	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Get Fox.
L542579	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Is it for real?
L542895	u3044	m199	LYMAN	You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
L542894	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	You have no conception of this, do you?
L542893	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Bullshit!
L542892	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
L542891	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Save us all a lot of trouble.
L542890	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
L542604	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
L542603	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
L542723	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
L542722	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
L542720	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	The police think he was high on drugs...
L542719	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was a man though... right?
L542718	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
L542717	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
L542716	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
L542715	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
L542714	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Yes.
L542713	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	To the same woman?
L542712	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Twenty-eight years.
L542711	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You married, Major?
L542710	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I know, but...
L542709	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was only an accident that we discovered them.
L542708	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
L542573	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	We better get it into the box. Come on...
L542572	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Oh, Jesus.
L542570	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
L542569	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	People have made mistakes in these situations before.
L542568	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
L542567	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It could have been anything.
L542566	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	No, sir. Radar.
L542565	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Was there visual contact?
L542564	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
L542563	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Wait'll you see it.
L542562	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
L542561	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	No.
L542560	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Can you see under the faceplate?
L542559	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
L542558	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
L542557	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Very beautiful country up here...
L542556	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	This has always been my favorite time of day.
L543164	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543163	u3046	m199	MAN	I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
L543162	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand.
L543161	u3046	m199	MAN	Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
L543160	u3046	m199	MAN	Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
L543159	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand.
L543156	u3046	m199	MAN	Hop in.
L543155	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
L543154	u3046	m199	MAN	Where are you going?
L542734	u3046	m199	MAN	Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
L542733	u3052	m199	WOMAN	I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
L542732	u3046	m199	MAN	You know that's impossible!
L542731	u3052	m199	WOMAN	Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
L542730	u3046	m199	MAN	Judy, that's stupid.
L542729	u3052	m199	WOMAN	I told you...
L543036	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
L543035	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
L543034	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I wouldn't think so.
L543033	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
L543032	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
L543031	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You saw that?
L543030	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
L543029	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
L543028	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
L543027	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
L543026	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Is there a reward in this?
L543411	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
L543410	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
L543409	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
L543408	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
L543407	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We can't let you do that.
L543406	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
L543405	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hello...
L550988	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just not the eyes.
L550987	u3053	m200	BEEMER	I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
L550986	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
L550985	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
L550984	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
L550983	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Bullshit politics.
L550982	u3057	m200	LENNY	I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
L550981	u3053	m200	BEEMER	Yeah, that's right.
L550726	u3057	m200	LENNY	A star is born.
L550725	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	No problem.
L550724	u3057	m200	LENNY	Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
L550723	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Yeah, right.
L550722	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it ""being wired,"" but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?"
L550721	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	Hey, fuck you, man.
L550720	u3057	m200	LENNY	Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
L550719	u3054	m200	EDUARDO	What's all this squid shit?
L550718	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
L551312	u3055	m200	FAITH	I live for the moment.
L551311	u3062	m200	TRAN	Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
L551310	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
L551065	u3062	m200	TRAN	Maybe later.
L551064	u3055	m200	FAITH	Fuck you.
L551063	u3062	m200	TRAN	The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
L551062	u3062	m200	TRAN	I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
L551061	u3055	m200	FAITH	He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
L551060	u3062	m200	TRAN	"Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him."
L551059	u3055	m200	FAITH	You said you were going to get her out of this.
L551057	u3062	m200	TRAN	You're going down.
L551056	u3055	m200	FAITH	I made my choice, Lenny.
L551051	u3062	m200	TRAN	A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
L551050	u3055	m200	FAITH	Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
L550939	u3062	m200	TRAN	Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
L550938	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're too goddamned paranoid.
L550937	u3062	m200	TRAN	He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
L550936	u3055	m200	FAITH	Leave him alone, Tran.
L550935	u3062	m200	TRAN	Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
L550931	u3062	m200	TRAN	Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
L550930	u3055	m200	FAITH	We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
L551428	u3055	m200	FAITH	'We might as well make the best of it.'
L551427	u3059	m200	MAX	And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
L551426	u3055	m200	FAITH	Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
L551425	u3059	m200	MAX	I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
L551424	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423	u3059	m200	MAX	You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
L551388	u3055	m200	FAITH	My God.
L551387	u3059	m200	MAX	Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
L551385	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
L551384	u3055	m200	FAITH	Jesus.
L551383	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382	u3055	m200	FAITH	You can't just... kill him.
L551381	u3055	m200	FAITH	What're you going to do?
L551380	u3059	m200	MAX	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378	u3059	m200	MAX	This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300	u3055	m200	FAITH	What a nightmare.
L551299	u3057	m200	LENNY	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298	u3055	m200	FAITH	You think Tran killed her?
L551297	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296	u3055	m200	FAITH	So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Mace is in this.
L551285	u3055	m200	FAITH	We should talk alone.
L551284	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281	u3055	m200	FAITH	What's going on?
L551048	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tell me.
L551047	u3055	m200	FAITH	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045	u3055	m200	FAITH	Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044	u3057	m200	LENNY	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043	u3055	m200	FAITH	Who did it?
L551042	u3057	m200	LENNY	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969	u3055	m200	FAITH	"You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say ""The End."" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
L550968	u3057	m200	LENNY	Can't do it.
L550967	u3055	m200	FAITH	Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966	u3057	m200	LENNY	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963	u3055	m200	FAITH	Damn right.
L550962	u3057	m200	LENNY	Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960	u3055	m200	FAITH	Maybe.
L550959	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958	u3055	m200	FAITH	He has his uses too.
L550957	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956	u3055	m200	FAITH	That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954	u3055	m200	FAITH	Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tonight.
L550950	u3055	m200	FAITH	You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'm already hurting.
L550946	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933	u3055	m200	FAITH	No, Lenny.
L550932	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, call me, okay?
L550926	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920	u3057	m200	LENNY	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919	u3055	m200	FAITH	Cut it out, Tran.
L550881	u3055	m200	FAITH	Make me forget it, baby.
L550880	u3057	m200	LENNY	Forget it's there.
L550879	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877	u3055	m200	FAITH	I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736	u3057	m200	LENNY	Watch and see.
L550735	u3055	m200	FAITH	Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773	u3057	m200	LENNY	You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772	u3056	m200	KEITH	Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769	u3057	m200	LENNY	Step into my office.
L550768	u3056	m200	KEITH	What?  Right Here?
L550767	u3057	m200	LENNY	Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766	u3056	m200	KEITH	Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764	u3056	m200	KEITH	Sounds good.
L550761	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760	u3056	m200	KEITH	What kind of things exactly?
L550759	u3057	m200	LENNY	That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758	u3056	m200	KEITH	Clips.
L550757	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756	u3056	m200	KEITH	Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755	u3057	m200	LENNY	A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754	u3056	m200	KEITH	No.
L550750	u3056	m200	KEITH	That's right.
L550749	u3057	m200	LENNY	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748	u3056	m200	KEITH	I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421	u3059	m200	MAX	This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417	u3059	m200	MAX	Naawww.
L551416	u3057	m200	LENNY	So there never was a death squad.
L551414	u3059	m200	MAX	You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413	u3057	m200	LENNY	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412	u3059	m200	MAX	No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411	u3057	m200	LENNY	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410	u3059	m200	MAX	Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409	u3059	m200	MAX	I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408	u3057	m200	LENNY	I won't say anything.
L551407	u3059	m200	MAX	Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405	u3059	m200	MAX	You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404	u3057	m200	LENNY	Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401	u3059	m200	MAX	That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400	u3057	m200	LENNY	So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399	u3059	m200	MAX	You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus!
L551397	u3059	m200	MAX	You just did.
L551396	u3057	m200	LENNY	What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395	u3059	m200	MAX	I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394	u3057	m200	LENNY	Where's Faith?
L551393	u3059	m200	MAX	I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392	u3059	m200	MAX	Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321	u3059	m200	MAX	I intend to.
L551320	u3057	m200	LENNY	2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318	u3057	m200	LENNY	This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317	u3059	m200	MAX	Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316	u3057	m200	LENNY	What do you mean?
L551315	u3059	m200	MAX	He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269	u3059	m200	MAX	No.  Bad idea.
L551268	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267	u3059	m200	MAX	Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus.
L551261	u3059	m200	MAX	Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260	u3057	m200	LENNY	What stuff?
L551259	u3059	m200	MAX	All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whattya mean?
L551252	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251	u3059	m200	MAX	Is he dead?
L551250	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's been cooked-off
L551248	u3057	m200	LENNY	You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247	u3059	m200	MAX	Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116	u3057	m200	LENNY	Looks like she was holding out.
L551115	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith OK?
L551112	u3057	m200	LENNY	W'sup, Max?
L551111	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why me?
L551028	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025	u3057	m200	LENNY	He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024	u3059	m200	MAX	Top ten.
L551023	u3057	m200	LENNY	But this is a bad one.
L551022	u3059	m200	MAX	So've I.  Too much.
L551021	u3057	m200	LENNY	So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020	u3059	m200	MAX	But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019	u3057	m200	LENNY	He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018	u3059	m200	MAX	And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017	u3057	m200	LENNY	He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015	u3057	m200	LENNY	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014	u3059	m200	MAX	Let's work it.
L551013	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012	u3059	m200	MAX	You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her.
L550975	u3057	m200	LENNY	Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974	u3059	m200	MAX	I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973	u3057	m200	LENNY	You should feel like shit.
L550972	u3059	m200	MAX	I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shutup a second!
L550825	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818	u3059	m200	MAX	An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816	u3059	m200	MAX	See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797	u3059	m200	MAX	I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795	u3059	m200	MAX	Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791	u3057	m200	LENNY	You were lucky, Max.
L550789	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788	u3059	m200	MAX	That's not sayin' much.
L550787	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786	u3059	m200	MAX	D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.
L550784	u3059	m200	MAX	Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781	u3057	m200	LENNY	Least you can do.
L550780	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778	u3059	m200	MAX	You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155	u3057	m200	LENNY	She never gave me a tape.
L551154	u3061	m200	TICK	I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153	u3057	m200	LENNY	What clip?  What was it?
L551152	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150	u3061	m200	TICK	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who was just here?
L551148	u3061	m200	TICK	Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?
L551146	u3061	m200	TICK	Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143	u3061	m200	TICK	Well... the guy's fucked up.
L551142	u3057	m200	LENNY	Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141	u3061	m200	TICK	Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690	u3057	m200	LENNY	What else you got?
L550689	u3061	m200	TICK	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688	u3057	m200	LENNY	I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687	u3061	m200	TICK	Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685	u3061	m200	TICK	Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683	u3061	m200	TICK	Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682	u3061	m200	TICK	Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681	u3057	m200	LENNY	So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678	u3061	m200	TICK	Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676	u3061	m200	TICK	I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674	u3061	m200	TICK	With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673	u3057	m200	LENNY	How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672	u3061	m200	TICK	Sorry.
L550671	u3057	m200	LENNY	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670	u3061	m200	TICK	Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055	u3062	m200	TRAN	I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's alright.  He means it.
L551053	u3062	m200	TRAN	Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052	u3057	m200	LENNY	Charm.
L550928	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927	u3062	m200	TRAN	About what?
L550924	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923	u3062	m200	TRAN	I always do.
L550922	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921	u3062	m200	TRAN	Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918	u3062	m200	TRAN	I already got everything I need from you.
L550917	u3057	m200	LENNY	You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916	u3062	m200	TRAN	You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Your existence.
L550872	u3057	m200	LENNY	Your sex life?
L550871	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870	u3057	m200	LENNY	I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Commissioner Strickland.
L550866	u3057	m200	LENNY	Strickland.
L550865	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Nero.
L551451	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  See you there.
L551450	u3057	m200	LENNY	See you downtown.
L551449	u3058	m200	MACE	Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  We did.
L551447	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we under arrest?
L551363	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362	u3057	m200	LENNY	Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361	u3058	m200	MACE	Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Trust me.
L551359	u3058	m200	MACE	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358	u3057	m200	LENNY	Take it to him.
L551354	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353	u3058	m200	MACE	That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352	u3057	m200	LENNY	I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351	u3058	m200	MACE	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350	u3057	m200	LENNY	Alright.  We're going up.
L551348	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.
L551347	u3057	m200	LENNY	You see Tran?
L551346	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345	u3057	m200	LENNY	Got your ticket?
L551344	u3058	m200	MACE	Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace... you're a girl.
L551340	u3058	m200	MACE	No, it's not.
L551339	u3057	m200	LENNY	But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338	u3058	m200	MACE	You never told me.
L551337	u3057	m200	LENNY	I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  It didn't.
L551335	u3057	m200	LENNY	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334	u3058	m200	MACE	I guess.
L551333	u3057	m200	LENNY	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm not going.
L551322	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294	u3058	m200	MACE	Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293	u3057	m200	LENNY	Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271	u3057	m200	LENNY	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270	u3058	m200	MACE	Who's Strickland?
L551266	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265	u3058	m200	MACE	The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254	u3058	m200	MACE	How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246	u3057	m200	LENNY	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245	u3058	m200	MACE	Why?
L551244	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243	u3058	m200	MACE	I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242	u3057	m200	LENNY	It was a tough call.
L551241	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240	u3057	m200	LENNY	There's a plus side?
L551239	u3058	m200	MACE	Well, look at the plus side.
L551238	u3057	m200	LENNY	So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232	u3057	m200	LENNY	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231	u3058	m200	MACE	People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229	u3058	m200	MACE	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228	u3057	m200	LENNY	We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225	u3058	m200	MACE	I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200	u3058	m200	MACE	Tell me.
L551192	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191	u3058	m200	MACE	You sure?
L551190	u3057	m200	LENNY	Those two guys were cops.
L551186	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185	u3058	m200	MACE	I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180	u3058	m200	MACE	Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179	u3057	m200	LENNY	Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178	u3057	m200	LENNY	The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177	u3058	m200	MACE	This is bad.
L551176	u3058	m200	MACE	It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175	u3057	m200	LENNY	Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173	u3057	m200	LENNY	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172	u3058	m200	MACE	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shit!
L551166	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158	u3058	m200	MACE	Something in your car...
L551157	u3057	m200	LENNY	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156	u3058	m200	MACE	Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful."
L551134	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131	u3057	m200	LENNY	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130	u3058	m200	MACE	You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128	u3058	m200	MACE	Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L551123	u3057	m200	LENNY	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122	u3058	m200	MACE	Where we going?
L551121	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace!
L551120	u3058	m200	MACE	Whatup Lenny?
L551103	u3057	m200	LENNY	S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101	u3058	m200	MACE	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100	u3057	m200	LENNY	How's Zander?
L551099	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure.
L551098	u3057	m200	LENNY	The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097	u3058	m200	MACE	Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096	u3057	m200	LENNY	And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095	u3058	m200	MACE	That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094	u3057	m200	LENNY	Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093	u3058	m200	MACE	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092	u3057	m200	LENNY	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091	u3058	m200	MACE	So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090	u3057	m200	LENNY	"She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason."
L551089	u3058	m200	MACE	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088	u3057	m200	LENNY	No it doesn't.
L551087	u3058	m200	MACE	But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086	u3057	m200	LENNY	See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083	u3058	m200	MACE	It's not your fault.
L551082	u3057	m200	LENNY	She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080	u3058	m200	MACE	No more, Lenny.
L551079	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078	u3058	m200	MACE	Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077	u3057	m200	LENNY	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076	u3058	m200	MACE	So that gives you something.
L551075	u3057	m200	LENNY	He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073	u3057	m200	LENNY	Never really thought about it.
L551072	u3058	m200	MACE	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071	u3057	m200	LENNY	Is this great fabric or what?
L551039	u3058	m200	MACE	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035	u3058	m200	MACE	This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030	u3058	m200	MACE	Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wants to share.
L551026	u3058	m200	MACE	And gives it to you.
L551008	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you sure it's real?
L551007	u3057	m200	LENNY	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006	u3058	m200	MACE	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005	u3057	m200	LENNY	Black.  Jack.
L551004	u3058	m200	MACE	My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000	u3057	m200	LENNY	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L550995	u3057	m200	LENNY	No idea.
L550994	u3058	m200	MACE	What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993	u3057	m200	LENNY	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992	u3058	m200	MACE	What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990	u3058	m200	MACE	You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915	u3057	m200	LENNY	You'll see.
L550914	u3058	m200	MACE	Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913	u3057	m200	LENNY	She's my destiny.
L550912	u3058	m200	MACE	She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911	u3057	m200	LENNY	She still loves me.
L550910	u3058	m200	MACE	Forget her.
L550909	u3057	m200	LENNY	Rams... that's football, right?
L550908	u3058	m200	MACE	Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904	u3057	m200	LENNY	Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903	u3058	m200	MACE	Jesus, Lenny.
L550902	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900	u3057	m200	LENNY	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899	u3058	m200	MACE	Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895	u3058	m200	MACE	No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894	u3057	m200	LENNY	So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893	u3058	m200	MACE	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892	u3057	m200	LENNY	I thought we were friends.
L550891	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be no.
L550887	u3058	m200	MACE	Get it.
L550886	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884	u3057	m200	LENNY	In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876	u3057	m200	LENNY	Let's talk in the car.
L550875	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we having a bad night?
L550864	u3058	m200	MACE	You will not live to see the morning.
L550863	u3057	m200	LENNY	Coming with you.
L550862	u3058	m200	MACE	What the fuck are you doing?
L550860	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859	u3058	m200	MACE	Fumitsu.
L550858	u3057	m200	LENNY	What's his name?
L550856	u3058	m200	MACE	Define love.
L550855	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854	u3058	m200	MACE	Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853	u3057	m200	LENNY	Define illegal.
L550852	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851	u3057	m200	LENNY	Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850	u3058	m200	MACE	Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847	u3057	m200	LENNY	Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846	u3058	m200	MACE	Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845	u3057	m200	LENNY	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844	u3058	m200	MACE	So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843	u3058	m200	MACE	Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841	u3058	m200	MACE	Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838	u3058	m200	MACE	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836	u3058	m200	MACE	Sleaze to peddle.
L550835	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834	u3058	m200	MACE	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820	u3057	m200	LENNY	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819	u3058	m200	MACE	Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Aw, Mom!
L551194	u3058	m200	MACE	We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110	u3058	m200	MACE	Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108	u3058	m200	MACE	What is that?
L551107	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you going to make me beg?
L551106	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Right.  That explains it.
L551105	u3058	m200	MACE	Just Lenny.
L551104	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276	u3059	m200	MAX	You really want that on your head?
L551275	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274	u3059	m200	MAX	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273	u3058	m200	MACE	So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257	u3059	m200	MAX	There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256	u3058	m200	MACE	This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255	u3059	m200	MAX	Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037	u3058	m200	MACE	Take the tape to the cops.
L551036	u3059	m200	MAX	Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033	u3058	m200	MACE	Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032	u3059	m200	MAX	He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830	u3059	m200	MAX	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829	u3058	m200	MACE	But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822	u3059	m200	MAX	Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
L562603	u3064	m201	CANDY	The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
L562602	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Testa?
L562601	u3064	m201	CANDY	To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
L562600	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Besides that.
L562599	u3064	m201	CANDY	Um... he was older.
L562598	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Was this him?
L562506	u3065	m201	DAITZ	Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
L562505	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
L562502	u3065	m201	DAITZ	"You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was ""out to get him."" The decision was made to relieve him."
L562501	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
L562500	u3065	m201	DAITZ	...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
L562499	u3065	m201	DAITZ	Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
L562498	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No.
L562497	u3065	m201	DAITZ	"Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter ""Z,"" turned it on it's side, got ""N"" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?"
L562496	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Have you had a chance to think about --
L562262	u3077	m201	SALINAS	The diner?
L562261	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	No, sir.
L562260	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Anybody talk to the press?
L562259	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
L562258	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
L562221	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
L562220	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
L562200	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Yeah.
L562199	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
L562198	u3066	m201	DUNCAN	Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
L562812	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Winona.
L562811	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
L562810	u3067	m201	DYLAN	She's buried.
L562809	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You have the body?
L562808	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
L562807	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What?
L562806	u3067	m201	DYLAN	You heard?
L562805	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
L562804	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Hi there.
L562803	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
L562802	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Dylan here.
L562389	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
L562388	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
L562387	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
L562385	u3067	m201	DYLAN	And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
L562384	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The room key's in the car. On the seat.
L562382	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's take a look.
L562381	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
L562380	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What does the Manager say?
L562379	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
L562378	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Hey, Sheriff.
L562377	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm on my way.
L562376	u3067	m201	DYLAN	No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
L562375	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You tell me.
L562374	u3067	m201	DYLAN	What's the bad news?
L562373	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
L562372	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
L562371	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Agent Mackelway.
L562296	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
L562295	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This isn't in our database?
L562294	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Who knows.
L562293	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You're thinking...?
L562292	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
L562291	u3067	m201	DYLAN	I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
L562290	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
L562289	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
L562280	u3067	m201	DYLAN	That's right, Jan.
L562279	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
L562243	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Ten miles back on the Texas side.
L562242	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
L562230	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
L562229	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
L562228	u3067	m201	DYLAN	Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
L562227	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You run the plates?
L562844	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
L562843	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	A grill pattern.
L562842	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
L562841	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
L562840	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm sorry. This won't take long.
L562839	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
L562313	u3077	m201	SALINAS	That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
L562312	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
L562306	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This is Agent Mackelway.
L562305	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
L562300	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
L562299	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
L562298	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
L562297	u3068	m201	EAGLEFOOT	Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
L562880	u3078	m201	ZERO	Not as much as you'd think.
L562879	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
L562878	u3078	m201	ZERO	It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
L562877	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
L562876	u3078	m201	ZERO	Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
L562875	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	I have 6 tons.
L562874	u3078	m201	ZERO	Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
L562873	u3069	m201	FOREMAN	There seems to be a discrepancy.
L562196	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Why me? What do you want from me!?
L562195	u3074	m201	LOW	I've been looking for you.
L562192	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What do you want from me?
L562191	u3074	m201	LOW	You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
L562190	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
L562189	u3074	m201	LOW	Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
L562186	u3074	m201	LOW	What's wrong with me?
L562185	u3070	m201	HAROLD	You're a... you're sick.
L562184	u3074	m201	LOW	Not bad, huh?
L562183	u3070	m201	HAROLD	My God.
L562181	u3074	m201	LOW	Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
L562180	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Look, mister...
L562179	u3074	m201	LOW	Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
L562178	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What are you...?
L562177	u3074	m201	LOW	You know, you ever think about other women?
L562176	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Excuse me?
L562175	u3074	m201	LOW	You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
L562174	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Look...
L562173	u3074	m201	LOW	About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
L562172	u3070	m201	HAROLD	What?
L562171	u3074	m201	LOW	Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
L562170	u3070	m201	HAROLD	I don't mean to be rude, but...
L562169	u3074	m201	LOW	Whole country or just hereabouts?
L562168	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Yeah.
L562167	u3074	m201	LOW	You must travel a lot, huh?
L562166	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
L562165	u3074	m201	LOW	Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
L562164	u3070	m201	HAROLD	You... surprised me.
L562163	u3074	m201	LOW	Hi. What's in the case?
L562162	u3070	m201	HAROLD	Jesus.
L562286	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Put a BOLO out on that.
L562285	u3071	m201	JANITA	An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
L562284	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What kind?
L562283	u3071	m201	JANITA	There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
L562282	u3071	m201	JANITA	It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
L562281	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He was sitting here?
L562278	u3071	m201	JANITA	He had an orange hat on.
L562277	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How did you know he was a construction worker?
L562276	u3071	m201	JANITA	I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
L562275	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did he look like?
L562274	u3071	m201	JANITA	Yes.
L562273	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
L562416	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
L562415	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
L562414	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	"Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about ""Zorro Killer"" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?"
L562413	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Maybe something to do with Zorro.
L562412	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	He said it was a clue?
L562316	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
L562315	u3077	m201	SALINAS	At the field office.
L562314	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You have the photo from the diner?
L562311	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What's with the eyelids?
L562310	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
L562309	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What about his killer?
L562308	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
L562950	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
L562949	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
L562948	u3073	m201	KULOK	Please.
L562947	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What are you doing?
L562946	u3073	m201	KULOK	Deputy Director, get out, sir.
L562596	u3073	m201	KULOK	Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
L562595	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Another what?
L562594	u3073	m201	KULOK	We have another one.
L562593	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	What?
L562592	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
L562345	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Smarter than us.
L562344	u3073	m201	KULOK	Maybe cause he's smart.
L562343	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
L562304	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just an observer.
L562303	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
L562904	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
L562903	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Dick Low's a killer too.
L562902	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
L562901	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
L562900	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
L562899	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
L562898	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
L562897	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
L562896	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
L562895	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	He's got you believing in Zero now too.
L562747	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
L562746	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I understand.
L562745	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
L562744	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
L562743	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	There was talk of a file photo.
L562742	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I didn't use Low's name.
L562741	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
L562740	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was looking for a pattern.
L562739	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
L562738	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
L562737	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You didn't tell anyone where you were?
L562736	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was visiting an old college friend.
L562735	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Why did you go to Chicago?
L562625	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
L562624	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Huh?, sir.
L562623	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
L562622	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
L562621	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
L562618	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Collected shoes too?
L562617	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was ""Imelda."" Have to give him that, had a sense of humor."
L562591	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
L562590	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
L562589	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
L562588	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"You knew the arm slash was not ""Zorro."""
L562587	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
L562586	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How long ago?
L562585	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
L562584	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
L562583	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
L562582	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Was?
L562581	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
L562580	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
L562579	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	"Murman was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original ""Catch Me Before I Kill Again"" killer. Short for ""Murder Man."" It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field."
L562558	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
L562557	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm hesitant to...
L562556	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I don't believe this.
L562555	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
L562547	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
L562546	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
L562545	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
L562428	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
L562427	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
L562426	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What I do requires confidentiality.
L562425	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'll take it into consideration.
L562424	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
L562423	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
L562422	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
L562421	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
L562410	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Go ahead.
L562409	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
L562405	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
L562404	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Do you think he singled you out?
L562403	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He got away. I had him. He got away.
L562402	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
L562401	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
L562400	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	How do you feel, Agent
L562369	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Then why do I still have a badge?
L562368	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Its called insubordination.
L562367	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
L562366	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You refused to comply with a direct order.
L562365	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
L562364	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
L562363	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
L562362	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
L562361	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
L562360	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	I'll relay this to CIIAC.
L562353	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	MyDick.
L562352	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	From the grave?
L562351	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Speck. Harold Speck.
L562350	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Who?
L562349	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I think I talked to him.
L562347	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	This better be important.
L562346	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
L562945	u3074	m201	LOW	You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
L562944	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
L562943	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
L562942	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
L562941	u3074	m201	LOW	When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
L562937	u3074	m201	LOW	Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
L562936	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You are so fucked up.
L562935	u3074	m201	LOW	How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
L562934	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
L562933	u3074	m201	LOW	You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
L562932	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Don't you touch him.
L562926	u3072	m201	KOESSLER	Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
L562925	u3074	m201	LOW	Miss me, Dave?
L562907	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm going to Amarillo.
L562906	u3073	m201	KULOK	What happened?
L562872	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
L562871	u3073	m201	KULOK	How are we going to find him?
L562870	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
L562869	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
L562868	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime --
L562867	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've got to take a piss.
L562866	u3073	m201	KULOK	I...
L562865	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
L562863	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"But it was your idea: ""use Zero,"" you said, use Zero to get Low."
L562862	u3073	m201	KULOK	You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
L562861	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
L562860	u3073	m201	KULOK	Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
L562859	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Low calls him Suspect Zero.
L562858	u3073	m201	KULOK	All the same killer?
L562857	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as ""burn residue."" Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection."
L562856	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's quite advanced.
L562853	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's going on?
L562852	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah, of course.
L562851	u3073	m201	KULOK	You okay?
L562850	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
L562849	u3073	m201	KULOK	Tom, you okay?
L562848	u3073	m201	KULOK	Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
L562847	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	But why this pattern?
L562832	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
L562831	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
L562830	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
L562829	u3073	m201	KULOK	You're putting me in a difficult position.
L562828	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
L562827	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
L562826	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
L562825	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'd be real careful if I were you.
L562824	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
L562823	u3073	m201	KULOK	Koessler doesn't know any of this?
L562822	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
L562821	u3073	m201	KULOK	Does one exist?
L562820	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
L562819	u3073	m201	KULOK	And you're working with him?
L562818	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You were right. He found me.
L562817	u3073	m201	KULOK	Slow down a second, you met with Low --
L562816	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
L562815	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's going on?
L562814	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I guess I'm a little paranoid.
L562813	u3073	m201	KULOK	This feels like something out of a spy novel.
L562714	u3073	m201	KULOK	But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
L562713	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
L562712	u3073	m201	KULOK	Suspect Zero.
L562711	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Start killing people for real?
L562710	u3073	m201	KULOK	You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
L562709	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
L562696	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
L562695	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's up?
L562694	u3073	m201	KULOK	Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
L562693	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jaime? Where are you?
L562692	u3073	m201	KULOK	Hello?
L562657	u3073	m201	KULOK	I just need to go a little slow.
L562656	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
L562655	u3073	m201	KULOK	That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
L562654	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not the way I can.
L562653	u3073	m201	KULOK	And nobody else can do that?
L562652	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
L562651	u3073	m201	KULOK	You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
L562650	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's that?
L562649	u3073	m201	KULOK	Then there's the other issue.
L562648	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's true.
L562647	u3073	m201	KULOK	There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
L562646	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh.
L562645	u3073	m201	KULOK	No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
L562644	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
L562643	u3073	m201	KULOK	Maybe we should back off a bit.
L562642	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You did.
L562641	u3073	m201	KULOK	I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
L562640	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
L562639	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
L562620	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
L562619	u3073	m201	KULOK	You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
L562615	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
L562614	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
L562613	u3073	m201	KULOK	You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
L562612	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You mean --
L562611	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sue Ann Hanson.
L562610	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The tattoo?
L562609	u3073	m201	KULOK	We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
L562608	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Jesus.
L562607	u3073	m201	KULOK	We did find these, however.
L562606	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
L562605	u3073	m201	KULOK	No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
L562604	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Find the feet?
L562528	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not yet. Not about this, either.
L562527	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not about coming to see Daitz?
L562526	u3073	m201	KULOK	Just routine stuff.
L562525	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What did you tell him?
L562524	u3073	m201	KULOK	He's called a couple times.
L562523	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Does Koessler ask about me?
L562522	u3073	m201	KULOK	I've been thinking about this.
L562521	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I know.
L562520	u3073	m201	KULOK	It's a no-no.
L562519	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Intra-Agency fraternizing.
L562518	u3073	m201	KULOK	There are Agency regulations about this.
L562517	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Oh yeah, I forgot.
L562516	u3073	m201	KULOK	Because you asked him to, stupid.
L562515	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
L562514	u3073	m201	KULOK	No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
L562513	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
L562512	u3073	m201	KULOK	Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
L562511	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
L562510	u3073	m201	KULOK	Huh?
L562509	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
L562508	u3073	m201	KULOK	Don't be too harsh.
L562507	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
L562473	u3073	m201	KULOK	He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
L562472	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
L562471	u3073	m201	KULOK	I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
L562470	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
L562469	u3073	m201	KULOK	"Me too.  Make any headway with ""Zorro""?"
L562468	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
L562465	u3073	m201	KULOK	My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
L562464	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
L562463	u3073	m201	KULOK	What's this country coming to?
L562462	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He thinks he looks young.
L562461	u3073	m201	KULOK	Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
L562460	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Look at this fellow... or this one.
L562458	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sex.
L562457	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What's that?
L562456	u3073	m201	KULOK	And one other thing.
L562455	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
L562454	u3073	m201	KULOK	I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
L562453	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
L562452	u3073	m201	KULOK	You got a point there.
L562451	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
L562450	u3073	m201	KULOK	This is some serious shit.
L562449	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: ""I went live last month."""
L562448	u3073	m201	KULOK	Gone live?
L562447	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
L562446	u3073	m201	KULOK	They're all criminals?
L562445	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
L562444	u3073	m201	KULOK	You want to have dinner?
L562443	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The other reason?
L562442	u3073	m201	KULOK	That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
L562441	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying ""friends"" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, ""How to Plant Perennials."" Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how."
L562440	u3073	m201	KULOK	What about the chat rooms themselves?
L562439	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes ""ghosted,"" invisible."
L562438	u3073	m201	KULOK	Don't even go there. What's up?
L562437	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The man knew how to dress.
L562436	u3073	m201	KULOK	Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
L562418	u3073	m201	KULOK	It explains a lot.
L562417	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes I do.
L562408	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Where's my watch? It's gone.
L562407	u3073	m201	KULOK	Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
L562336	u3073	m201	KULOK	A very sexy case.
L562335	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	That information's being withheld from the media.
L562334	u3073	m201	KULOK	And who kills in the manner of his victim.
L562333	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
L562332	u3073	m201	KULOK	Doesn't fit.
L562331	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
L562330	u3073	m201	KULOK	This is a sexy case.
L562329	u3073	m201	KULOK	Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
L562328	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Why did he come out here? What's going on?
L562327	u3073	m201	KULOK	Not especially.
L562326	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You work with Koessler?
L562325	u3073	m201	KULOK	Five months. I love it.
L562324	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How long have you been downtown?
L562323	u3073	m201	KULOK	I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
L562322	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The Academy, then CIIAC.
L562321	u3073	m201	KULOK	You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
L562320	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
L562319	u3073	m201	KULOK	None taken.
L562318	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
L562317	u3073	m201	KULOK	Thanks for the ride.
L562986	u3073	m201	KULOK	I'll be back.
L562985	u3074	m201	LOW	Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
L562983	u3073	m201	KULOK	Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
L562982	u3074	m201	LOW	No weapon.
L562981	u3073	m201	KULOK	Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
L562963	u3073	m201	KULOK	I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
L562962	u3074	m201	LOW	Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
L562961	u3074	m201	LOW	Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
L562960	u3073	m201	KULOK	Mack must think Zero has a police band.
L562955	u3073	m201	KULOK	Sit back.
L562954	u3074	m201	LOW	Unlock these cuffs.
L562931	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
L562930	u3073	m201	KULOK	Kulok.
L562929	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent...
L562994	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah.
L562993	u3074	m201	LOW	Was it Zero?
L562992	u3074	m201	LOW	The boy's okay. I saw him...
L562991	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yeah.
L562990	u3074	m201	LOW	Is he dead?
L562799	u3074	m201	LOW	Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
L562798	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You? You went by the book?
L562797	u3074	m201	LOW	This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
L562796	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Maybe you should back off.
L562795	u3074	m201	LOW	We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
L562794	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Those were just fantasies.
L562793	u3074	m201	LOW	I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
L562792	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It was the mall.
L562791	u3074	m201	LOW	You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
L562790	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Who told you about her?
L562789	u3074	m201	LOW	If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
L562788	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I already have an employer.
L562787	u3074	m201	LOW	There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
L562786	u3074	m201	LOW	Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
L562785	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	You knew it was me all along?
L562784	u3074	m201	LOW	And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
L562783	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How do you know who's real and who's not?
L562782	u3074	m201	LOW	After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
L562781	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
L562780	u3074	m201	LOW	Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
L562779	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Zero killed them all?
L562778	u3074	m201	LOW	It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
L562776	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
L562775	u3074	m201	LOW	Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
L562774	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession...
L562773	u3074	m201	LOW	You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
L562772	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I don't carry it with me.
L562771	u3074	m201	LOW	Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
L562770	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	So you went underground?
L562769	u3074	m201	LOW	Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
L562768	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Suspect Zero?
L562767	u3074	m201	LOW	I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
L562766	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	What was your weakness, sir?
L562765	u3074	m201	LOW	He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
L562764	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He's moved on to TV.
L562763	u3074	m201	LOW	He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
L562762	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
L562761	u3074	m201	LOW	How's the arm?
L562760	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
L562759	u3074	m201	LOW	Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
L562752	u3074	m201	LOW	When you exit, head east on 10th.
L562751	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562750	u3074	m201	LOW	This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
L562749	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes.
L562748	u3074	m201	LOW	Agent Mackelway?
L562398	u3074	m201	LOW	I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
L562397	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Who are you?
L562396	u3074	m201	LOW	The little piggie speaks.
L562395	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How did you know Speck was a killer?
L562734	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
L562733	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
L562732	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
L562731	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to go live with you.
L562730	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[What does the file say?]
L562729	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
L562728	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[You tell me.]
L562727	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
L562726	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
L562725	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
L562724	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Not the heart, the watch.]
L562723	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I want to help you.
L562722	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
L562721	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's talk about Zero.
L562717	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
L562716	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
L562674	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
L562673	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
L562672	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
L562671	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	If I owe, I will go.
L562670	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
L562669	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I've been to Chicago.
L562667	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Follow me.]
L562666	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Lead the way, Murman.
L562665	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
L562659	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Something came up, Murman, my man.
L562658	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Lionheart, what happened?]
L562532	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Whatever happened to MyDick?
L562531	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Reality very risky.]
L562478	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
L562477	u3076	m201	MURMAN	[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
L562894	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
L562893	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
L562892	u3077	m201	SALINAS	What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
L562891	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I don't think you understand.
L562887	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
L562886	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
L562885	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
L562884	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
L562883	u3077	m201	SALINAS	350 miles.
L562882	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	How far is Amarillo?
L562420	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
L562419	u3077	m201	SALINAS	But why attack an Agent?
L562359	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I talked to him.
L562358	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Speck is dead.
L562357	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	"Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the ""item"" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick."
L562356	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I don't...
L562355	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
L562354	u3077	m201	SALINAS	MyDick?
L562302	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
L562301	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	No.
L562266	u3077	m201	SALINAS	The same.
L562265	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Koessler?
L562264	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
L562263	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
L562224	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
L562223	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562222	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
L562219	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
L562218	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
L562217	u3077	m201	SALINAS	This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
L562216	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
L562215	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Attitude Adjustment Issues -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
L562214	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Four hundred and sixty, sir.
L562213	u3077	m201	SALINAS	I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
L562212	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I screwed up twice, sir.
L562211	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center. Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
L562210	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Sounds like fun.
L562209	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
L562208	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
L562207	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Thomas Mackelway.
L562206	u3077	m201	SALINAS	Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
L562205	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I believe it's in my file, sir.
L562204	u3077	m201	SALINAS	What did you do to end up here?
L562203	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Yes, sir.
L562202	u3077	m201	SALINAS	So you're the new meat?
L562201	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
L562978	u3078	m201	ZERO	Take your shirt off.
L562977	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	It's over for you.
L562976	u3078	m201	ZERO	"You want to ""profile"" me? Find out what makes me ""tick""? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?"
L562972	u3078	m201	ZERO	Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
L562971	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
L562970	u3078	m201	ZERO	Murman!
L562969	u3075	m201	MACKELWAY	I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
L591891	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
L591890	u3202	m211	HILDA	Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
L591889	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
L591888	u3202	m211	HILDA	He'll be there at 8:30.
L591887	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
L591886	u3202	m211	HILDA	I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
L591885	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
L591884	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
L591883	u3202	m211	HILDA	The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
L591882	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
L591881	u3202	m211	HILDA	You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
L591774	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
L591773	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Maybe a little demonstration.
L591772	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
L591771	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
L591770	u3204	m211	KLAATU	That can easily be arranged.
L591769	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
L591768	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Yes -- of course.
L591767	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
L591766	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Yes.
L591765	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
L591764	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I assure you such power exists.
L591763	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Such power exists?
L591762	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
L591761	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
L591760	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
L591759	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
L591758	u3204	m211	KLAATU	My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
L591757	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
L591756	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- not at all.
L591755	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
L591754	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I leave that in your hands.
L591753	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
L591752	u3204	m211	KLAATU	That's what I came to see you about.
L591751	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
L591750	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
L591749	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	What -- what sort of action do you mean?
L591748	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
L591747	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
L591746	u3204	m211	KLAATU	What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
L591745	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Would you care to be more specific?
L591744	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
L591743	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
L591742	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
L591741	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
L591740	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
L591739	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	If you mean that you are afraid of us--
L591738	u3204	m211	KLAATU	In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
L591737	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Yes -- that is true.
L591736	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
L591735	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	That was my first question.
L591734	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I would like to explain something of my mission here.
L591733	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
L591732	u3204	m211	KLAATU	You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
L591730	u3204	m211	KLAATU	My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
L591729	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
L591728	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
L591727	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
L591726	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
L591725	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
L591723	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
L591722	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
L591721	u3197	m211	BARNHARDT	You wrote this?
L591854	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
L591853	u3201	m211	HELEN	Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
L591852	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
L591847	u3201	m211	HELEN	Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
L591846	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
L591844	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
L591843	u3201	m211	HELEN	He gave these to you?
L591837	u3201	m211	HELEN	You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
L591836	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Yes, I have!
L591835	u3201	m211	HELEN	Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
L591829	u3198	m211	BOBBY	No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
L591828	u3201	m211	HELEN	Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
L591827	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
L591826	u3201	m211	HELEN	Now, Bobby, just a minute--
L591825	u3198	m211	BOBBY	I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
L591824	u3201	m211	HELEN	Tell me what?
L591823	u3198	m211	BOBBY	I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
L591822	u3201	m211	HELEN	Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
L591815	u3201	m211	HELEN	No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
L591814	u3198	m211	BOBBY	I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
L591813	u3201	m211	HELEN	What do you mean, dear?
L591812	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
L591811	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
L591810	u3201	m211	HELEN	Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
L591809	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
L591808	u3201	m211	HELEN	Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
L591807	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Okay.
L591806	u3201	m211	HELEN	Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
L591683	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
L591682	u3201	m211	HELEN	Of course, dear.
L591681	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
L591680	u3201	m211	HELEN	Professor Barnhardt.
L591679	u3198	m211	BOBBY	We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
L591678	u3201	m211	HELEN	I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
L591677	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
L591676	u3201	m211	HELEN	Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
L591667	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
L591666	u3201	m211	HELEN	Did you have a nice day, dear?
L591663	u3201	m211	HELEN	Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
L591662	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Hi Mom!
L591528	u3201	m211	HELEN	That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
L591527	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
L591524	u3201	m211	HELEN	"I think we've all been hearing too much about ""space men."""
L591523	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
L591820	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
L591819	u3198	m211	BOBBY	What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
L591818	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
L591817	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
L591803	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'll say goodnight again.
L591802	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
L591801	u3204	m211	KLAATU	All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
L591675	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Goodnight.
L591674	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
L591673	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
L591669	u3198	m211	BOBBY	We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
L591668	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We certainly did.
L591665	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Mr. Brady's a cop.
L591664	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
L591647	u3198	m211	BOBBY	She doesn't like me to steal from people.
L591646	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Why not, Bobby?
L591645	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
L591643	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Well, sure, but--
L591642	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
L591641	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
L591640	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
L591639	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee -- those look like diamonds!
L591638	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
L591637	u3198	m211	BOBBY	I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
L591636	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
L591635	u3198	m211	BOBBY	No foolin'? Will you?
L591634	u3204	m211	KLAATU	All right.
L591633	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Go to the movies.
L591630	u3204	m211	KLAATU	They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
L591629	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
L591628	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
L591627	u3198	m211	BOBBY	"Mr. Carpenter"" -- you don't seem to know about anything."
L591626	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- I'm afraid not.
L591625	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
L591624	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Did all these people die in wars?
L591610	u3204	m211	KLAATU	He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
L591609	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
L591608	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
L591607	u3198	m211	BOBBY	What does that mean?
L591603	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We can scare him more than he can scare us.
L591602	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
L591601	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Wouldn't you like to meet him?
L591600	u3198	m211	BOBBY	You're just kidding, aren't you?
L591599	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
L591597	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
L591596	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
L591595	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
L591594	u3198	m211	BOBBY	You think they'll ever find him?
L591592	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
L591591	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee! How could they make a landing?
L591590	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
L591588	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Yes -- I think so.
L591587	u3198	m211	BOBBY	You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
L591586	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
L591585	u3198	m211	BOBBY	I thought that was only for bombs.
L591584	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
L591583	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
L591582	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I shouldn't be at all surprised.
L591581	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
L591580	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
L591579	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Where is that?
L591578	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Sure. Right near where my mother works.
L591577	u3204	m211	KLAATU	He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
L591576	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
L591573	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
L591572	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
L591571	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
L591522	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- I'm afraid not.
L591521	u3198	m211	BOBBY	Are you an FBI man?
L591490	u3199	m211	CAPTAIN	He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
L591489	u3206	m211	MAJOR	How does he explain that?
L591488	u3199	m211	CAPTAIN	Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
L591487	u3206	m211	MAJOR	I don't believe it.
L591486	u3199	m211	CAPTAIN	He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
L591485	u3206	m211	MAJOR	Oh, I'd say forty-five.
L591484	u3199	m211	CAPTAIN	And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
L591483	u3206	m211	MAJOR	The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -? heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
L591513	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
L591512	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
L591511	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
L591510	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
L591509	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Your impatience is quite understandable.
L591508	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I can judge only by what I see.
L591507	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
L591506	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
L591505	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
L591504	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
L591503	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
L591502	u3200	m211	HARLEY	"Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  ""The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow.""  ""The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington.""  Well -- there you have it."
L591501	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Thank you... Have you any news?
L591500	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
L591472	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
L591471	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
L591470	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
L591468	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
L591467	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
L591466	u3200	m211	HARLEY	We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
L591465	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
L591464	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Perhaps if you could explain a little--
L591463	u3204	m211	KLAATU	My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
L591462	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I was only hoping to make you understand.
L591461	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
L591460	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
L591459	u3204	m211	KLAATU	The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
L591458	u3200	m211	HARLEY	You must have a rather strange impression of us.
L591457	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
L591456	u3200	m211	HARLEY	You know about the United Nations?
L591455	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
L591454	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
L591453	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
L591452	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I -- I'm not sure I understand--
L591451	u3204	m211	KLAATU	This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
L591450	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
L591449	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
L591448	u3200	m211	HARLEY	We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
L591447	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I mean the reasons for my coming here.
L591446	u3200	m211	HARLEY	The present situation?
L591445	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
L591444	u3200	m211	HARLEY	It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
L591443	u3204	m211	KLAATU	From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
L591442	u3200	m211	HARLEY	Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
L591441	u3204	m211	KLAATU	About 250 million of your miles.
L591440	u3200	m211	HARLEY	You must have come a long way.
L591439	u3204	m211	KLAATU	About five months -- your months.
L591438	u3200	m211	HARLEY	I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
L591437	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Sit down, Mr. Harley.
L591436	u3200	m211	HARLEY	The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
L591435	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Just Klaatu.
L591434	u3200	m211	HARLEY	My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
L591956	u3201	m211	HELEN	I'm not going to marry anybody.
L591955	u3207	m211	TOM	You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
L591954	u3201	m211	HELEN	I feel different right now.
L591953	u3207	m211	TOM	You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
L591952	u3207	m211	TOM	I don't care about the rest of the world!
L591951	u3201	m211	HELEN	Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
L591948	u3207	m211	TOM	Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
L591947	u3201	m211	HELEN	Is that what you're thinking about?
L591946	u3207	m211	TOM	He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
L591945	u3201	m211	HELEN	But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
L591944	u3207	m211	TOM	He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
L591943	u3201	m211	HELEN	That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
L591942	u3207	m211	TOM	Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
L591941	u3201	m211	HELEN	You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
L591940	u3207	m211	TOM	Are you crazy? After what happened today?
L591939	u3201	m211	HELEN	Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
L591938	u3207	m211	TOM	How do you know?
L591937	u3201	m211	HELEN	All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
L591936	u3207	m211	TOM	Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
L591935	u3201	m211	HELEN	What about him?
L591934	u3207	m211	TOM	I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
L591933	u3207	m211	TOM	Come on in.
L591932	u3201	m211	HELEN	Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
L591861	u3201	m211	HELEN	I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
L591860	u3207	m211	TOM	I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
L591851	u3201	m211	HELEN	I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
L591850	u3207	m211	TOM	You think it's all right for you to stay here?
L591849	u3201	m211	HELEN	Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
L591848	u3207	m211	TOM	I wonder if we ought to--
L591841	u3207	m211	TOM	Looks real to me.
L591840	u3201	m211	HELEN	Is it real?
L591839	u3207	m211	TOM	He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
L591799	u3207	m211	TOM	I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
L591798	u3201	m211	HELEN	Oh, Tom, that was awful.
L591793	u3207	m211	TOM	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
L591792	u3201	m211	HELEN	I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
L591791	u3207	m211	TOM	The picture starts at eight-fifty.
L591790	u3201	m211	HELEN	I will be in just a minute.
L591789	u3207	m211	TOM	You ready?
L591788	u3201	m211	HELEN	Hello--
L591660	u3207	m211	TOM	A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
L591659	u3201	m211	HELEN	You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
L591658	u3207	m211	TOM	The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
L591657	u3201	m211	HELEN	You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
L591656	u3207	m211	TOM	You still haven't answered my question.
L591655	u3201	m211	HELEN	It was a wonderful day.
L591562	u3201	m211	HELEN	There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
L591561	u3207	m211	TOM	Well, we could--
L591560	u3201	m211	HELEN	There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
L591559	u3207	m211	TOM	We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
L591995	u3201	m211	HELEN	I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
L591994	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm sorry.
L591993	u3201	m211	HELEN	No. That's all finished.
L591992	u3204	m211	KLAATU	He'll have you -- and Tom.
L591991	u3201	m211	HELEN	We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
L591986	u3204	m211	KLAATU	How long will I live?  That no one can say.
L591985	u3201	m211	HELEN	But how -- how long--?
L591984	u3204	m211	KLAATU	This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
L591983	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
L591982	u3201	m211	HELEN	You mean he has the power of life and death?
L591981	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I was.
L591980	u3201	m211	HELEN	I -- I thought you were--
L591979	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Hello.
L591971	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Remember those words.
L591970	u3201	m211	HELEN	Klaatu barada nikto.
L591969	u3204	m211	KLAATU	"There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: ""Klaatu barada nikto."" Please repeat that."
L591968	u3201	m211	HELEN	Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
L591967	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
L591966	u3201	m211	HELEN	It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
L591963	u3204	m211	KLAATU	At the ship.
L591962	u3201	m211	HELEN	Where is the meeting going to be?
L591961	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
L591919	u3201	m211	HELEN	Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
L591918	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Who?
L591917	u3201	m211	HELEN	No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
L591916	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
L591915	u3201	m211	HELEN	Where are you going now?
L591914	u3201	m211	HELEN	Yes -- Just exactly.
L591913	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It must be twelve-thirty.
L591912	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
L591911	u3201	m211	HELEN	You hold great hope for this meeting.
L591877	u3204	m211	KLAATU	You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
L591876	u3201	m211	HELEN	Why not?
L591875	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It won't work.
L591874	u3201	m211	HELEN	We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
L591873	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
L591872	u3201	m211	HELEN	Just twelve.
L591871	u3204	m211	KLAATU	What time is it?
L591870	u3201	m211	HELEN	What happened?
L591869	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
L591868	u3201	m211	HELEN	What is it you want?
L591866	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
L591865	u3201	m211	HELEN	I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
L591864	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I want to know what he told you last night.
L591863	u3201	m211	HELEN	Yes--?
L591862	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
L591858	u3204	m211	KLAATU	May I walk out with you?
L591857	u3201	m211	HELEN	I -- I was Just going to lunch.
L591856	u3204	m211	KLAATU	May I see you for a minute?
L591855	u3201	m211	HELEN	Oh -- hello--
L591805	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Goodnight, my dear.
L591804	u3201	m211	HELEN	Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
L591795	u3201	m211	HELEN	Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
L591794	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
L591787	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
L591786	u3201	m211	HELEN	Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
L591785	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
L591784	u3201	m211	HELEN	Naturally I think so.
L591783	u3204	m211	KLAATU	He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
L591782	u3201	m211	HELEN	He has his homework to keep him occupied.
L591781	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
L591780	u3201	m211	HELEN	Jittery is the word.
L591779	u3204	m211	KLAATU	Everyone seems so-- 
L591671	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I enjoyed every minute of it.
L591670	u3201	m211	HELEN	I don't know how to thank you.
L591620	u3204	m211	KLAATU	You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
L591619	u3202	m211	HILDA	Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
L591618	u3204	m211	KLAATU	We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
L591617	u3202	m211	HILDA	How did you get in here? And what do you want?
L591616	u3204	m211	KLAATU	He'll catch on to it in no time now.
L591615	u3202	m211	HILDA	How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
L591908	u3203	m211	JEWELER	I'd give you a very good price.
L591907	u3207	m211	TOM	No -- no, thanks.
L591906	u3203	m211	JEWELER	Would you like to sell it?
L591905	u3207	m211	TOM	You sure about that?
L591904	u3203	m211	JEWELER	There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
L591903	u3207	m211	TOM	That's what I wanted you to tell me.
L591902	u3203	m211	JEWELER	I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
L591901	u3207	m211	TOM	Is it worth anything?
L591714	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
L591713	u3204	m211	KLAATU	May I suggest that you call the Professor?
L591710	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
L591709	u3204	m211	KLAATU	How long will that take?
L591708	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
L591707	u3204	m211	KLAATU	They would have killed this man?
L591706	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
L591702	u3204	m211	KLAATU	You don't.
L591701	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	Well, how do I know who you are?
L591700	u3204	m211	KLAATU	No -- I'm afraid not.
L591699	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
L591698	u3204	m211	KLAATU	It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
L591697	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	But I suppose you know the answer.
L591696	u3204	m211	KLAATU	In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
L591695	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
L591694	u3204	m211	KLAATU	That's right.
L591693	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
L591692	u3204	m211	KLAATU	I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
L591691	u3205	m211	LIEUTENANT	The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
L602040	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
L602039	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Where these tracks headed?
L602036	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I know.
L602035	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Dogs don't eat each other.
L602034	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe dinner.
L602032	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Let's load 'em.
L602031	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
L601888	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
L601887	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
L601842	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just listen.
L601841	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	What do you want from us?
L601795	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
L601794	u3218	m213	BENNINGS	Sixteen.
L601957	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
L601956	u3221	m213	CLARK	What the hell you looking at me like that for?
L601955	u3221	m213	CLARK	Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
L601954	u3219	m213	BLAIR	How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
L601952	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
L601951	u3221	m213	CLARK	Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
L601950	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
L601949	u3221	m213	CLARK	Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
L601948	u3219	m213	BLAIR	What was he doing in the rec room?
L601947	u3221	m213	CLARK	Yeah.
L601946	u3219	m213	BLAIR	That night?
L601945	u3221	m213	CLARK	No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
L601944	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
L601931	u3219	m213	BLAIR	It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
L601930	u3221	m213	CLARK	"What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?"
L601974	u3224	m213	GARRY	I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
L601973	u3219	m213	BLAIR	You can't let anybody leave!
L601972	u3224	m213	GARRY	Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
L601971	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
L601968	u3224	m213	GARRY	If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
L601967	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
L601960	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
L601959	u3224	m213	GARRY	Anybody sick?
L601958	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... It could have gotten to somebody...
L601938	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
L601937	u3224	m213	GARRY	So what's our problem?
L601936	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Look, I know it's hard to believe...
L601896	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Maybe.
L601895	u3224	m213	GARRY	Sure.  You think there's a connection?
L601894	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
L601893	u3224	m213	GARRY	Couldn't make much of it myself.
L601890	u3224	m213	GARRY	I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
L601889	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
L602156	u3226	m213	NAULS	You promise?
L602155	u3219	m213	BLAIR	And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
L602154	u3226	m213	NAULS	Now why'd you go and...
L602153	u3226	m213	NAULS	Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
L602152	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
L602151	u3226	m213	NAULS	What you doin'?
L601927	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
L601926	u3226	m213	NAULS	Finish what?
L601925	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
L602223	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see...
L602222	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
L602221	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Have you come across Fuchs?
L602220	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
L602007	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
L602006	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602005	u3219	m213	BLAIR	Watch Clark.
L602004	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
L602003	u3219	m213	BLAIR	I don't know who to trust.
L602002	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How you doin', old boy?
L601996	u3219	m213	BLAIR	No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
L601995	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
L601994	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
L601991	u3219	m213	BLAIR	... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
L601990	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Too damn dangerous.
L602287	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  Just let him freeze out there.
L602286	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
L602285	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
L602284	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.  Now...
L602279	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Hell no.
L602278	u3228	m213	PALMER	Let's open it.
L602268	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If it did get to him.
L602267	u3228	m213	PALMER	Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
L602249	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
L602248	u3228	m213	PALMER	Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
L602243	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now hold on, you dumb...
L602242	u3228	m213	PALMER	We got to burn 'em.
L602241	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's it going to do, being a plant?
L602240	u3228	m213	PALMER	Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
L602239	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Let go of me...
L602238	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs!!
L602237	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now who'd go and do...
L602236	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody broke in.
L602230	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
L602229	u3228	m213	PALMER	Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
L602216	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Don't walk behind me.
L602215	u3228	m213	PALMER	What?
L602146	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Ain't it there?
L602145	u3228	m213	PALMER	Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
L601912	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cool it, Palmer!!
L601911	u3228	m213	PALMER	Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
L602198	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You lying bastard...
L602197	u3224	m213	GARRY	Was dark... find a light...
L602196	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I said where?  Where'd you go?!
L602107	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
L602106	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
L602105	u3224	m213	GARRY	I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
L601743	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
L601742	u3224	m213	GARRY	You catch anything he was saying?
L602261	u3226	m213	NAULS	When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
L602260	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut him loose?
L602259	u3226	m213	NAULS	Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
L602171	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
L602170	u3226	m213	NAULS	Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
L602167	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Clark, you come on out here!!
L602166	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's shorted out or something!
L602165	u3220	m213	CHILDS	That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
L602164	u3226	m213	NAULS	I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
L602163	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
L602162	u3220	m213	CHILDS	No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
L602161	u3226	m213	NAULS	Childs!  That a fuse?
L602062	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
L602061	u3226	m213	NAULS	Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
L602441	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
L602440	u3220	m213	CHILDS	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
L602439	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't make it.
L602438	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then we'll never make it.
L602437	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Maybe we shouldn't.
L602436	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
L602435	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Neither will we.
L602434	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
L602433	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Not the only one.
L602429	u3220	m213	CHILDS	"What do you mean ""you think so?"""
L602428	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I think so.
L602374	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
L602373	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Spaceship of some kind.
L602358	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
L602357	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Load of bullshit.
L602345	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
L602344	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We should have jumped his ass.
L602338	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Then kill me.
L602337	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then I'll have to kill you.
L602336	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You ain't tying me up.
L602333	u3225	m213	MACREADY	For your health.
L602332	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What for?
L602331	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
L602314	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We ain't buying that.
L602313	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
L602299	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You been made, MacReady.
L602298	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What clothes?
L602297	u3220	m213	CHILDS	We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
L602296	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
L602295	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L602283	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
L602282	u3220	m213	CHILDS	... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
L602212	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
L602211	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, who says I want you going with me?!
L602181	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Gee, thanks!
L602180	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
L602179	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Garry's missing!
L602178	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What?
L602177	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L602126	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got morphine, don't we.
L602125	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What do we do about those three?
L602054	u3225	m213	MACREADY	He's gone already!  Do it!
L602053	u3220	m213	CHILDS	But...
L602052	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch them!!
L602051	u3225	m213	MACREADY	How the fuck do I know?!
L602050	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What we going to do?!
L602038	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Probably the next meal.
L602037	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Where's the other half?
L602030	u3225	m213	MACREADY	That's good enough.
L602029	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
L601921	u3220	m213	CHILDS	You buy any of this, Blair?
L601920	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
L601919	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
L601918	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
L601910	u3220	m213	CHILDS	I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
L601909	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
L601907	u3220	m213	CHILDS	Well, go on.
L601906	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Look, I'm just guessing...
L601905	u3220	m213	CHILDS	MacReady!
L601879	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
L601878	u3220	m213	CHILDS	The dogs?
L601877	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Torch it over there!
L601875	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
L601874	u3220	m213	CHILDS	What's happening?
L602354	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
L602353	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Thank you.
L602352	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I guess you're okay.
L602324	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Damn you, MacReady!
L602323	u3225	m213	MACREADY	And if anyone tries to wake me...
L602321	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Enough, MacReady!
L602320	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
L602319	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Now hold him.
L602097	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I think so.
L602096	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Would that test have worked?
L602094	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I guess I'm the only one.
L602093	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, who's got access to it?
L601817	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
L601816	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
L601815	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you doing?
L601814	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	All in Norwegian.
L601813	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anything?
L601807	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
L601806	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Hey, Sweden!!!
L601805	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Come on, Copper.
L601804	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	My God, what in hell happened here?
L601789	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
L601788	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
L602084	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, get to it.
L602083	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A couple of hours.
L602082	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long will it take you to prepare this?
L602064	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
L602063	u3224	m213	GARRY	Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
L601844	u3224	m213	GARRY	Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
L601843	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
L601767	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Bennings?
L601766	u3224	m213	GARRY	In this weather?
L601765	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
L601764	u3224	m213	GARRY	Nothing we can do about that.
L601763	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
L602228	u3227	m213	NORRIS	After all this mess.
L602227	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	After all this mess then.
L602226	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
L602225	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
L602104	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A day or so ago... I guess.
L602103	u3227	m213	NORRIS	When was the last time you used it?
L602102	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
L602076	u3222	m213	DR. COPPER	A serum test possibly.
L602075	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
L602078	u3224	m213	GARRY	What's that?
L602077	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Right.  Why not?
L601761	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
L601760	u3224	m213	GARRY	How many in their party?
L601741	u3224	m213	GARRY	That far?
L601740	u3223	m213	FUCHS	'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
L601739	u3224	m213	GARRY	How far's that?
L601738	u3223	m213	FUCHS	Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
L602115	u3224	m213	GARRY	I'll put this right through your head.
L602114	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	No.
L602113	u3224	m213	GARRY	Put that down!
L601963	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
L601962	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
L601826	u3224	m213	GARRY	Well, stick to it.
L601825	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
L601824	u3224	m213	GARRY	You reach anybody yet?
L601823	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Hey, man...!
L602413	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Little over two hours.
L602412	u3224	m213	GARRY	How long's it been?
L602393	u3224	m213	GARRY	One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
L602392	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Looks good.
L602363	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
L602362	u3224	m213	GARRY	Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
L602335	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Damn if I won't.
L602334	u3224	m213	GARRY	Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
L602101	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Could anyone have gotten it from you?
L602100	u3224	m213	GARRY	Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
L602024	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
L602023	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
L602022	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
L602019	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I am going after them.
L602018	u3224	m213	GARRY	You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
L601882	u3224	m213	GARRY	Extinguishers.
L601881	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Don't let up, Childs!
L601880	u3224	m213	GARRY	We're on fire!
L601791	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
L601790	u3224	m213	GARRY	Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
L602343	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
L602342	u3228	m213	PALMER	He's dead.
L602341	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Tie up Clark, too.
L602330	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
L602329	u3228	m213	PALMER	What kind of test?
L602207	u3228	m213	PALMER	I ain't going with Sanchez.
L602206	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
L602189	u3228	m213	PALMER	Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
L602188	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We going to make it?
L602187	u3228	m213	PALMER	Somebody definitely messed with it.
L602186	u3228	m213	PALMER	Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
L602185	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
L602148	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Move it, Palmer.
L602147	u3228	m213	PALMER	No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
L602087	u3228	m213	PALMER	And that was enough?
L602086	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
L602085	u3228	m213	PALMER	How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
L602026	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
L602025	u3228	m213	PALMER	Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
L601984	u3228	m213	PALMER	Blair.  He's gone berserk.
L601983	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's...
L601793	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
L601792	u3228	m213	PALMER	Four!
L602387	u3225	m213	MACREADY	I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
L602386	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	He might just wait us out.
L602382	u3225	m213	MACREADY	It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
L602381	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What if it doesn't come?
L602205	u3225	m213	MACREADY	If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
L602204	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Why?
L602203	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
L602191	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
L602190	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Where were the flashlights?
L602132	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Can you think of any other tests?
L602131	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
L602416	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bet the last place you ever go.
L602415	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Then we go after him.
L602414	u3226	m213	NAULS	Maybe it ain't coming.
L602409	u3226	m213	NAULS	Position, my ass...
L602408	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Calm down and get in your position.
L602407	u3226	m213	NAULS	Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
L602406	u3226	m213	NAULS	Screw the generator!!
L602405	u3225	m213	MACREADY	The generator!
L602404	u3226	m213	NAULS	Get back!!
L602385	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
L602384	u3226	m213	NAULS	You crazy?  He might be inside already?
L602383	u3225	m213	MACREADY	You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
L602379	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Forget about Childs.  He's over.
L602378	u3226	m213	NAULS	What about Childs?
L602376	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Anyplace but here.
L602375	u3226	m213	NAULS	Where was he trying to go?
L602372	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Everything that's been missing.
L602371	u3226	m213	NAULS	What is it?
L602348	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
L602347	u3226	m213	NAULS	What are you going to do?  Drink it?
L602346	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
L602277	u3226	m213	NAULS	Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
L602276	u3225	m213	MACREADY	... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
L602233	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
L602232	u3226	m213	NAULS	This storm do that?
L602141	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Just keep looking.
L602140	u3226	m213	NAULS	That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
L602176	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Well, let's get down there.
L602175	u3227	m213	NORRIS	It's the generator I think!  No power.
L602174	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Yeah!
L602173	u3227	m213	NORRIS	MacReady, that you?
L602172	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What's happened?!
L602130	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
L602129	u3227	m213	NORRIS	We should sleep in shifts.
L602099	u3225	m213	MACREADY	Who else could have used that key?
L602098	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
L601902	u3225	m213	MACREADY	No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
L601901	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You know damn well what we both make of it.
L601900	u3225	m213	MACREADY	So what do you make of it?
L601899	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
L601785	u3225	m213	MACREADY	What for?
L601784	u3227	m213	NORRIS	Get your gear on.
L601783	u3225	m213	MACREADY	We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
L601782	u3227	m213	NORRIS	You jerking off or just pissed?
L602399	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	Can't hear you.
L602398	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
L602397	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	What?!
L602396	u3226	m213	NAULS	It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
L602395	u3226	m213	NAULS	Hear what?
L602394	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	You hear that?
L602266	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	When do you think it got to him?
L602265	u3226	m213	NAULS	He's one of them.
L602264	u3229	m213	SANCHEZ	MacReady...?
L602263	u3226	m213	NAULS	... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
L604377	u3233	m214	KALEN	But there's nothing here.
L604376	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  Just about here.
L604375	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Around here.
L604374	u3233	m214	KALEN	This is it?
L604373	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... Well, you wanted to see it.
L604240	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
L604239	u3233	m214	KALEN	But you're only a mud carrier.
L604238	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
L604237	u3233	m214	KALEN	No...
L604236	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I think we should go on by ourselves.
L604183	u3233	m214	KALEN	He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
L604182	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What happened?
L604181	u3233	m214	KALEN	I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
L604179	u3233	m214	KALEN	About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
L604178	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What kind of stories?
L604177	u3233	m214	KALEN	No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
L604174	u3233	m214	KALEN	I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
L604173	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
L604172	u3233	m214	KALEN	The Hall of Books.
L604171	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where?
L604170	u3233	m214	KALEN	There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
L604169	u3233	m214	KALEN	We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
L604168	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
L604167	u3233	m214	KALEN	What else can they do?
L604166	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
L604165	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm so sorry, Kalen.
L604164	u3233	m214	KALEN	She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
L603999	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
L603998	u3233	m214	KALEN	And everyone looks like us?
L603997	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
L603995	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
L603994	u3233	m214	KALEN	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
L603993	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ah... no.
L603990	u3233	m214	KALEN	I'm training to be a high climber.
L603989	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	On the towers?
L603988	u3233	m214	KALEN	What do you do on the towers?
L603986	u3233	m214	KALEN	I figured that.  What kind of accident?
L603985	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I had an accident.
L603984	u3233	m214	KALEN	Now how did you get hurt?
L603963	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	The journey is part of my work.
L603962	u3233	m214	KALEN	It must have been hard, leaving your work.
L604370	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I will...
L604369	u3241	m214	VOX	I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
L604368	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll never forget this.
L604367	u3241	m214	VOX	Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
L604365	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
L604364	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't understand.
L604363	u3241	m214	VOX	Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
L604362	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I won't leave you like this.
L604361	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
L604360	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox...
L604359	u3241	m214	VOX	Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
L604358	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
L604357	u3241	m214	VOX	Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
L604356	u3241	m214	VOX	Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
L604355	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox --
L604279	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This has to end.
L604278	u3241	m214	VOX	End...?
L604277	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This has to end.
L604276	u3241	m214	VOX	How are your dreams now?
L604275	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604274	u3241	m214	VOX	They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
L604271	u3241	m214	VOX	Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
L604270	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What do you mean?
L604269	u3241	m214	VOX	Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
L604268	u3241	m214	VOX	The Morlocks didn't build this.
L604267	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why did they built it?
L604266	u3241	m214	VOX	The air... the power.
L604265	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
L604264	u3241	m214	VOX	This way.
L604263	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox?
L604262	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you know which way?
L604261	u3241	m214	VOX	Yes.
L604260	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Machines?
L604259	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... Thank you.
L604258	u3241	m214	VOX	In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
L604257	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
L604256	u3241	m214	VOX	Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
L604255	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is the way in?
L604254	u3241	m214	VOX	It's what they want you to see.
L604250	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, shut up.
L604249	u3241	m214	VOX	Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
L604248	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604247	u3241	m214	VOX	So, do we go on?
L604246	u3241	m214	VOX	It was meant to.
L604245	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes...
L604244	u3241	m214	VOX	It frightens you.
L604243	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God... I saw this.
L604235	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Kalen... hold on a minute.
L604234	u3241	m214	VOX	Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
L604233	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L604232	u3241	m214	VOX	Send him away.
L604231	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Last night.
L604230	u3241	m214	VOX	When was his mother taken?
L604228	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm used to that.
L604227	u3241	m214	VOX	And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
L604226	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604225	u3241	m214	VOX	So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
L604224	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
L604223	u3241	m214	VOX	Excuse me?
L604222	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because you'll never die.
L604218	u3241	m214	VOX	Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
L604217	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	We need your help.
L604214	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Can you show us where they live?
L604213	u3241	m214	VOX	Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
L604212	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How have you survived so long?
L604211	u3241	m214	VOX	I was lucky.  The others weren't.
L604210	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But you escaped.
L604209	u3241	m214	VOX	Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
L604208	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you know where they live?
L604207	u3241	m214	VOX	Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
L604206	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know of them?
L604205	u3241	m214	VOX	Morlocks --
L604204	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
L604201	u3241	m214	VOX	I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
L604200	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir... have you a name?
L604199	u3241	m214	VOX	"An ""automaton""?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And ""these fragments I have shored against my ruins.""  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here..."
L604198	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
L604197	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
L604196	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What are you?
L604195	u3241	m214	VOX	I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
L604194	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	1899.
L604193	u3241	m214	VOX	I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
L604192	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How did you know?!
L604191	u3241	m214	VOX	Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
L604351	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because...
L604350	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And why not?
L604349	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't think that's going to happen.
L604348	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
L604347	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Oh, you won't be running for long...
L604346	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm tired of running.
L604345	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
L604344	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know.
L604343	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
L604342	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm a foolish man.
L604341	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	That was a foolish thing to do.
L604334	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
L604333	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604332	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
L604329	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604328	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Now will you go?
L604327	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
L604326	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	A man can change his history.
L604325	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
L604324	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
L604323	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You took her because she helped me.
L604322	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
L604321	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	So you take their best...
L604320	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
L604319	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why?
L604314	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
L604313	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
L604312	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Say I just come back again?
L604311	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
L604310	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why would you let me go back?
L604309	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
L604308	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L604305	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It can't all be like this...
L604304	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
L604303	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
L604302	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	"I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more ""human"" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now."
L604301	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
L604300	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	They survived above.  Became what they are.
L604299	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And what of the Eloi?
L604298	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
L604297	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How?
L604296	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	We make them see what we wish.
L604295	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you control the Morlocks?
L604294	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
L604293	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
L604292	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	As slaves.
L604291	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
L604290	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Created?
L604289	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	No, we created the Morlocks.
L604288	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
L604287	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
L604286	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Alexander.
L604285	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	What's your name?
L603762	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
L603761	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
L603760	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
L603759	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
L603758	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I just love mechanical things.
L603757	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
L603756	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
L603755	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you keep the water temperature stable?
L603754	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
L603753	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
L603752	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
L603751	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's spectacular...
L603939	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
L603938	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why is it -- breaking up?
L603937	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
L603936	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
L603935	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
L603934	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's happening to the moon?!
L603933	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
L603932	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I -- what are you?!
L603931	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	May I help you?
L603918	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I have something for you...
L603917	u3232	m214	EMMA	Let them.
L603916	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Let them.
L603915	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex... people are staring.
L603912	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's only a machine.
L603911	u3232	m214	EMMA	Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
L603910	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've seen it.
L603909	u3232	m214	EMMA	Heavens, look at that now!
L603908	u3232	m214	EMMA	So it's astronomy now, is it?
L603907	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
L603906	u3232	m214	EMMA	They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
L603905	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
L603904	u3232	m214	EMMA	We took a walk three days ago.
L603903	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
L603902	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
L603899	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, it's just the zoo.
L603898	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God...
L603896	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
L603895	u3232	m214	EMMA	Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
L603894	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
L603893	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex...?!
L603892	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
L603891	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, what is it?
L603890	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right...
L603889	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No... let's walk through the city.
L603888	u3232	m214	EMMA	Let's walk through the park...
L603887	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  Please.
L603886	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right...
L603885	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I need... to talk to you.
L603884	u3232	m214	EMMA	Darling.
L603883	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Holding you... again.
L603882	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, what is it?
L603881	u3232	m214	EMMA	Trust me...
L603880	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
L603879	u3232	m214	EMMA	Dance with me...
L603878	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
L603877	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're late.
L603793	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Your birth stone.  I thought --
L603792	u3232	m214	EMMA	A moonstone.
L603791	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know it's not a diamond but --
L603790	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Hold on... I know I have it...
L603789	u3232	m214	EMMA	You know, the moment is rather dying here.
L603785	u3232	m214	EMMA	And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
L603784	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
L603783	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're getting warmer.
L603782	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I mean... well... affection.
L603781	u3232	m214	EMMA	Admiration?  My my.
L603780	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
L603779	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right, what is it now?
L603778	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
L603777	u3232	m214	EMMA	... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
L603775	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
L603774	u3232	m214	EMMA	Talk away, Professor.
L603773	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I need to... um... talk to you.
L603772	u3232	m214	EMMA	Well there's something new.
L603771	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sorry... I was distracted.
L603770	u3232	m214	EMMA	You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
L603769	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L603768	u3232	m214	EMMA	You promised me flowers.
L603767	u3232	m214	EMMA	Trust me...
L603766	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
L603765	u3232	m214	EMMA	Dance with me...
L603764	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
L603763	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're late.
L604388	u3239	m214	PHILBY	His home.
L604387	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This... was my home.
L604384	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I'm glad.
L604383	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
L603874	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Good night, Alex.
L603873	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good night, David.
L603872	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
L603871	u3239	m214	PHILBY	All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
L603870	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
L603869	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You won't say that in a week.
L603868	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
L603867	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's absurd --
L603866	u3239	m214	PHILBY	There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
L603865	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can't leave when I'm so close.
L603864	u3239	m214	PHILBY	When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
L603863	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can't do that --
L603862	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Why don't you come to our house instead?
L603861	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
L603860	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I would.
L603859	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You wouldn't believe me.
L603858	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What is it?
L603857	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
L603856	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
L603855	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
L603854	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Do you find her?
L603853	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
L603852	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It wasn't your fault, Alex.
L603851	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
L603850	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I know that --
L603849	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I live with it every minute of every day.
L603848	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
L603846	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I care more about my life.  And yours.
L603845	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
L603844	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
L603843	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Hiding?
L603842	u3239	m214	PHILBY	But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
L603841	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
L603840	u3239	m214	PHILBY	There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
L603839	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	For God's Sake, David --
L603838	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
L603837	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then why are you here?
L603836	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
L603835	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, David.
L603834	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
L603833	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've been working.
L603739	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Perseverance.
L603738	u3239	m214	PHILBY	All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
L603735	u3239	m214	PHILBY	She's gotten into your equations.
L603734	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh?
L603733	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
L603732	u3239	m214	PHILBY	No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
L603731	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
L603730	u3239	m214	PHILBY	She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
L603729	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
L603728	u3239	m214	PHILBY	The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
L603727	u3239	m214	PHILBY	How romantic...
L603726	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
L603715	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Nothing.
L603714	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What?
L603713	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	In the future, we'll be better.
L603711	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
L603710	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
L603709	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
L603708	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
L603707	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
L603706	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You sound like my father...
L603705	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
L603704	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where's the challenge in that?
L603703	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
L603702	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
L603662	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	God, and I'm running late --
L603661	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Tonight's the night?
L603660	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
L603659	u3239	m214	PHILBY	"Somewhere around ""D+2xy something something."""
L603658	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I was not.
L603657	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Do you know you were humming?
L603656	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
L603805	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All right, all right -- here -- everything --
L603804	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	Did you hear me, lad?
L603802	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't understand.
L603801	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
L603800	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir...?
L603799	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
L603798	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you...
L603797	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
L604379	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
L604378	u3235	m214	MARA	It was different then.
L604138	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
L604137	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara -- what -- ?!
L604134	u3235	m214	MARA	No!
L604133	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara...?
L604132	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen...
L604131	u3235	m214	MARA	Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
L604130	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara --
L604129	u3235	m214	MARA	Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
L604128	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I could...
L604127	u3235	m214	MARA	Go back to your own time?
L604126	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... I suppose so.
L604125	u3235	m214	MARA	So you can use it now?
L604124	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
L604123	u3235	m214	MARA	It's undamaged?
L604122	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
L604119	u3235	m214	MARA	I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
L604118	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
L604117	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	If you only knew...
L604116	u3235	m214	MARA	Is it?
L604115	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
L604114	u3235	m214	MARA	Someone you loved very much.
L604113	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604112	u3235	m214	MARA	You lost someone.
L604111	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is where my journey started... right here.
L604109	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
L604108	u3235	m214	MARA	You know this?
L604107	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
L604106	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Orion's belt...
L604105	u3235	m214	MARA	Alexander...?
L604104	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
L604103	u3235	m214	MARA	It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
L604102	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
L604101	u3235	m214	MARA	It must have been safe.
L604100	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
L604099	u3235	m214	MARA	Did you have fires at night?
L604098	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
L604097	u3235	m214	MARA	Learning was important?
L604096	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
L604095	u3235	m214	MARA	You liked it there.
L604094	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
L604092	u3235	m214	MARA	I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
L604091	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you decide?
L604090	u3235	m214	MARA	I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
L604089	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What are you?
L604088	u3235	m214	MARA	And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
L604087	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Or mud carriers.
L604086	u3235	m214	MARA	It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
L604085	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
L604084	u3235	m214	MARA	It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
L604083	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
L604082	u3235	m214	MARA	I don't understand.
L604081	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
L604080	u3235	m214	MARA	It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
L604079	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
L604078	u3235	m214	MARA	Want to be a high climber now, do you?
L604077	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can see Kalen's point.
L604076	u3235	m214	MARA	The mud carriers.
L604075	u3235	m214	MARA	Yes.
L604074	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	"And this is your ""work""?"
L604073	u3235	m214	MARA	Thank you.
L604072	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is magnificent...
L604070	u3235	m214	MARA	We share everything.
L604069	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You share dreams?  That's incredible.
L604068	u3235	m214	MARA	Every night.
L604067	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All of you?
L604066	u3235	m214	MARA	We all have that dream.
L604065	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes!
L604064	u3235	m214	MARA	And you saw a shape ahead of you...
L604063	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604062	u3235	m214	MARA	Then you came to a desert and mountains...
L604061	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
L604052	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good night.
L604051	u3235	m214	MARA	Good night, then.
L604050	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
L604049	u3235	m214	MARA	Don't then have stars where you come from?
L604048	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You can see so many here.
L604047	u3235	m214	MARA	You seem fascinated by the stars.
L604046	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you...
L604045	u3235	m214	MARA	I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
L604044	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I will...
L604043	u3235	m214	MARA	I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
L604042	u3235	m214	MARA	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
L604041	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Is he all right?
L604033	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
L604032	u3235	m214	MARA	I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
L604031	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
L604030	u3235	m214	MARA	I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
L604029	u3235	m214	MARA	Why would you do that?
L604028	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why not?
L604027	u3235	m214	MARA	Why?
L604026	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	More than 800,000 years.
L604025	u3235	m214	MARA	How long ago?
L604024	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
L604023	u3235	m214	MARA	That machine --
L604022	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
L604021	u3235	m214	MARA	Oh, that explains everything.
L604019	u3235	m214	MARA	Then you can speak slowly.
L604018	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
L604017	u3235	m214	MARA	We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
L604016	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What makes you say that?
L604015	u3235	m214	MARA	You're not from beyond the valley.
L604014	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
L604013	u3235	m214	MARA	He's gone to a better place.
L604012	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Your husband is dead?
L604011	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
L604007	u3235	m214	MARA	Mm.
L604006	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	His curiosity is amazing.
L604001	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
L604000	u3235	m214	MARA	Is there a lot of illness?
L603982	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you.
L603981	u3235	m214	MARA	Yes.
L603961	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
L603960	u3235	m214	MARA	How long did you travel?
L603946	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes...
L603945	u3235	m214	MARA	You're up!  You must be feeling better --
L603831	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That'll be all.
L603830	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	May I get you some --
L603829	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
L603827	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Tell him to go away --
L603826	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Yes, sir, he --
L603825	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Here?
L603824	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
L603743	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
L603742	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Oh, I'm already swooning.
L603741	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
L603740	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
L603724	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
L603723	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
L603722	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Don't torture me -- do you have it?
L603719	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Hello, Mr. Philby.
L603718	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you have it?!
L603717	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Oh huzzah, the master's home.
L603696	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
L603695	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes, sir.
L603692	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
L603691	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical ""durations"" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?"
L603690	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My equations are not parlor-tricks!
L603689	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
L603688	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
L603686	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir --
L603685	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
L603684	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, sir --
L603683	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't ""inspiring"" to you.  Perhaps they don't ""challenge"" you --"
L603682	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And roosters.
L603679	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Do they?
L603678	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
L603677	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
L603676	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Might I ask why?
L603675	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	"Well... perhaps I have ""deviated"" the tiniest bit."
L603674	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
L603673	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Imagine that.
L603672	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
L603671	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Exactly correct, sir.
L603670	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is ""Applied Mathematics and Engineering"", am I correct?"
L603669	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I see.
L603668	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
L604158	u3234	m214	KORUS	We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
L604157	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You won't even try?
L604156	u3234	m214	KORUS	We are what we are.
L604155	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then it's time to change that --
L604154	u3234	m214	KORUS	This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
L604151	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
L604150	u3234	m214	KORUS	We choose to believe it.
L604149	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know that's not true.
L604148	u3234	m214	KORUS	They've gone to a better place.
L604147	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What do you mean?!
L604146	u3234	m214	KORUS	Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
L604145	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	We have to go after them, find where -- !
L604144	u3234	m214	KORUS	We don't know.
L604143	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where do they take them?!
L604056	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I suppose so.
L604055	u3234	m214	KORUS	Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
L603980	u3234	m214	KORUS	Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
L603979	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
L603978	u3234	m214	KORUS	My father has gone to a better place.
L603977	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
L603976	u3234	m214	KORUS	I am the oldest.
L603975	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
L603974	u3234	m214	KORUS	New Yorkers.
L603973	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
L603972	u3234	m214	KORUS	Why?
L603971	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
L603968	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I took a different route.
L603967	u3234	m214	KORUS	He said he traveled for two months.
L603966	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L603965	u3234	m214	KORUS	We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
L603959	u3234	m214	KORUS	New Yorkers.
L603958	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
L603957	u3234	m214	KORUS	What are your people called?
L603956	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Eloi?
L603949	u3234	m214	KORUS	Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
L603948	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I did...
L603947	u3234	m214	KORUS	And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
L603700	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
L603699	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Yes, sir.
L603698	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
L603697	u3239	m214	PHILBY	If I might explain, sir --
L603694	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
L603693	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Sir, if I may --
L603667	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Dean Fulton...
L603666	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	My fowl have polluted the yard.
L604038	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
L604037	u3233	m214	KALEN	They're inside --
L604036	u3235	m214	MARA	No, you're safe --
L604035	u3233	m214	KALEN	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
L604034	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
L604004	u3233	m214	KALEN	You'll tell me more tomorrow?
L604003	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
L604002	u3233	m214	KALEN	I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
L603992	u3233	m214	KALEN	I am.  Are you a climber?
L603991	u3235	m214	MARA	We'll see about that.
L603970	u3235	m214	MARA	What's it like where you come from?
L603969	u3233	m214	KALEN	What did you do at night?
L603954	u3235	m214	MARA	That's quite enough, Kalen.
L603953	u3233	m214	KALEN	I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
L603952	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen...
L603951	u3233	m214	KALEN	How did you get hurt?
L604393	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
L604392	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
L604391	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
L604386	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
L604385	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Sir?
L604382	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	No, sir.
L604381	u3239	m214	PHILBY	And you've no idea where he went?
L604380	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
L603747	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	For our sake, I hope not.
L603746	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
L603721	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
L603720	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
L583651	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
L583650	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We never should have done this to him...
L583649	u3243	m215	BECKER	Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
L583518	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
L583517	u3243	m215	BECKER	Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
L583516	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Should we be...
L583515	u3243	m215	BECKER	What about Starks?
L583514	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But... what about Starks?
L583513	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then don't.
L583512	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
L583511	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm fine.
L583510	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	You ok?
L584055	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
L584054	u3243	m215	BECKER	I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
L584053	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
L584052	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't understand...
L584051	u3252	m215	STARKS	You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
L584050	u3243	m215	BECKER	How did you come to know their names?
L584046	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, we were patients.
L584045	u3243	m215	BECKER	The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
L584044	u3252	m215	STARKS	So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
L584043	u3243	m215	BECKER	It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
L584042	u3252	m215	STARKS	Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
L584041	u3243	m215	BECKER	Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
L584040	u3243	m215	BECKER	Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
L584039	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L584038	u3243	m215	BECKER	I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
L584037	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
L584036	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
L584035	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
L584034	u3243	m215	BECKER	No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
L584033	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
L584032	u3243	m215	BECKER	You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
L584031	u3243	m215	BECKER	How...how are you here?
L584030	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
L584029	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Beat] You're his son?
L584028	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
L584027	u3243	m215	BECKER	Who are you?
L583983	u3243	m215	BECKER	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
L583982	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker, how do you sleep at night?
L583981	u3243	m215	BECKER	Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
L583980	u3252	m215	STARKS	And what does that mean?
L583979	u3243	m215	BECKER	I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
L583978	u3252	m215	STARKS	You sure you know where to find one?
L583977	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
L583972	u3243	m215	BECKER	You killed him?
L583971	u3252	m215	STARKS	Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
L583970	u3243	m215	BECKER	Yes.
L583969	u3252	m215	STARKS	My business?
L583968	u3243	m215	BECKER	And what's that?
L583966	u3243	m215	BECKER	Temporarily.
L583965	u3252	m215	STARKS	They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
L583964	u3243	m215	BECKER	"It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our ""practices"" off to the New Year."
L583963	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583962	u3243	m215	BECKER	Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
L583773	u3243	m215	BECKER	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
L583772	u3252	m215	STARKS	Long live the Organization for the Organized!
L583696	u3243	m215	BECKER	Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
L583695	u3252	m215	STARKS	We are not birds of a feather.
L583692	u3243	m215	BECKER	I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
L583691	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't give a shit about your patient!
L583690	u3243	m215	BECKER	I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
L583689	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
L583688	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
L583687	u3243	m215	BECKER	You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
L583686	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
L583685	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
L583684	u3243	m215	BECKER	Relax.
L583683	u3243	m215	BECKER	Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
L583682	u3252	m215	STARKS	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
L583681	u3243	m215	BECKER	We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
L583680	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
L583679	u3243	m215	BECKER	In where?
L583678	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
L583658	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
L583657	u3252	m215	STARKS	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
L583656	u3243	m215	BECKER	He's recovering on the third floor.
L583466	u3243	m215	BECKER	It's not my job to believe you.
L583465	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
L583464	u3243	m215	BECKER	You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
L583463	u3252	m215	STARKS	Depends on what you're seeing.
L583462	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
L583461	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
L583460	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, your condition's pretty serious.
L583890	u3244	m215	DAMON	I never touched your father! I swear!
L583889	u3252	m215	STARKS	He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
L583888	u3244	m215	DAMON	I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
L583887	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
L583886	u3244	m215	DAMON	I thought you said you never knew your father.
L583885	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583884	u3244	m215	DAMON	Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
L583882	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
L583881	u3252	m215	STARKS	My father used to talk about you.
L583878	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
L583877	u3252	m215	STARKS	Did you know my father?
L583876	u3252	m215	STARKS	He didn't either.
L583875	u3244	m215	DAMON	That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
L583874	u3252	m215	STARKS	You may have known my father, William Starks.
L583873	u3244	m215	DAMON	Do I know you from somewhere?
L583749	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
L583748	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
L583747	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They should just be looking harder.
L583746	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What should they be looking for?
L583745	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
L583744	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
L583743	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Maybe it's not such a waste.
L583742	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
L583741	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We're late.
L584139	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
L584138	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	No, it hasn't.
L584137	u3252	m215	STARKS	And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
L584136	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	I can't take you out of here in your condition...
L584135	u3252	m215	STARKS	I need to get this letter to someone.
L584134	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thank you.
L584133	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
L584132	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is really happening, isn't it?
L583499	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L583498	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	Sure.
L583497	u3252	m215	STARKS	You done with your small talk?
L583496	u3252	m215	STARKS	I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
L583495	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
L583814	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
L583813	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
L583812	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
L583811	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
L583810	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
L583809	u3252	m215	STARKS	His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
L583808	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
L584162	u3249	m215	JEAN	Just do it.
L584161	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why?
L584160	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, go play in the snow.
L584157	u3249	m215	JEAN	Oh, yeah.
L584156	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
L584155	u3249	m215	JEAN	I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
L583430	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
L583429	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, he just fixed our car.
L583428	u3249	m215	JEAN	Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
L584194	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm doing fine.
L584193	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How you doin'?
L584185	u3252	m215	STARKS	I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
L584184	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
L584183	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
L584182	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think so.
L584171	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok.
L584170	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
L584150	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok, I guess.
L584149	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good. How's your mom?
L584148	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I've been ok.
L584089	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
L584088	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then, where are you going?
L584087	u3252	m215	STARKS	You gotta stop thinking like that.
L584086	u3248	m215	JACKIE	112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
L584085	u3252	m215	STARKS	When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
L584084	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What?
L584071	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok. Ssh. Rest.
L584070	u3252	m215	STARKS	Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
L584068	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
L584067	u3252	m215	STARKS	What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
L584065	u3248	m215	JACKIE	To the hospital.
L584064	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are we going?
L584063	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
L584062	u3252	m215	STARKS	If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
L584059	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
L584058	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, he didn't.
L584057	u3248	m215	JACKIE	That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
L584023	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
L584022	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William, you're not making sense.
L584021	u3252	m215	STARKS	They've got lives to be grateful for.
L584018	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's Sunday.
L584017	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
L584013	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] I don't know.
L584012	u3252	m215	STARKS	Then why isn't there anyone around?
L584011	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
L584010	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
L584008	u3252	m215	STARKS	There're no cars on this street.
L584007	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? What are you thinking?
L584004	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat, lost] No.
L584003	u3252	m215	STARKS	They're not.
L584002	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They're not here.
L584001	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
L584000	u3252	m215	STARKS	You're sure?
L583999	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
L583998	u3252	m215	STARKS	Me, too.
L583901	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
L583900	u3252	m215	STARKS	I might not be able to.
L583899	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
L583898	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
L583897	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
L583896	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
L583894	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
L583893	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know.
L583892	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How long do we have?
L583865	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
L583864	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583863	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
L583862	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
L583861	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You think Lorenson kills you?
L583860	u3252	m215	STARKS	I have no idea.
L583859	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
L583858	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't believe a thing she just said.
L583807	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
L583806	u3252	m215	STARKS	How? Did they figure it out after I died?
L583805	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know.
L583804	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
L583803	u3252	m215	STARKS	If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
L583802	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
L583801	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know.
L583800	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
L583799	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes.
L583798	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
L583797	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
L583796	u3252	m215	STARKS	Do you really believe me?
L583795	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
L583794	u3252	m215	STARKS	What?
L583793	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] You bled to death.
L583792	u3252	m215	STARKS	After I...
L583791	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But no one knew until after...
L583790	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
L583789	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah.
L583788	u3248	m215	JACKIE	The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
L583640	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Please...
L583639	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
L583638	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
L583637	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
L583636	u3252	m215	STARKS	It's December 25th, 1993 today.
L583635	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
L583634	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
L583633	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he die?
L583632	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
L583631	u3252	m215	STARKS	I gave you my dog tags.
L583630	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583629	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I looked it up.
L583628	u3248	m215	JACKIE	His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
L583627	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583626	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
L583625	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583624	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
L583623	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
L583622	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
L583621	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Well, you belong in one.
L583620	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
L583619	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
L583618	u3252	m215	STARKS	Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
L583617	u3248	m215	JACKIE	If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
L583616	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
L583615	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
L583441	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
L583440	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think I can remember what's on them.
L583439	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
L583438	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What for?
L583437	u3252	m215	STARKS	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
L583436	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What're those?
L583435	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
L583434	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're just gonna walk?
L583426	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah.
L583425	u3252	m215	STARKS	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
L583424	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But I like it I guess.
L583420	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Jackie.
L583419	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What's your name?
L583418	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah, but I don't know what.
L583417	u3252	m215	STARKS	Your mom take anything before this happened?
L583415	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Our car won't start.
L583414	u3252	m215	STARKS	You two ok?
L583413	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
L583851	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
L583850	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
L583838	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I still don't either, even after all these years.
L583837	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't understand.
L583836	u3250	m215	LORENSON	He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
L583835	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How?
L583834	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
L583833	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
L584142	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L584141	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
L584140	u3252	m215	STARKS	You know how to get there?
L584120	u3252	m215	STARKS	You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
L584119	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What are you talking about?
L584118	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
L584117	u3252	m215	STARKS	You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
L584116	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Who told you this?
L584115	u3252	m215	STARKS	"He's having absence [pronounced ""absance""] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly."
L584114	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me. That's all I ask.
L584113	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
L584111	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
L584110	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I do believe you...
L584109	u3252	m215	STARKS	You still don't believe me, do you?
L584108	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I'm not gonna let that happen.
L584107	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What for?
L584106	u3252	m215	STARKS	Can I get some paper and something to write with.
L584105	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
L584104	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
L584097	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You have nothing to fear, William.
L584096	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who...who kills me?
L584095	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah.
L584094	u3252	m215	STARKS	I did?
L584093	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You told me this was how it happened.
L584092	u3252	m215	STARKS	How...how do you know?
L584091	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
L583946	u3252	m215	STARKS	NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
L583945	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
L583944	u3252	m215	STARKS	Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
L583942	u3252	m215	STARKS	You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
L583941	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Eugene?
L583939	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
L583938	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
L583937	u3250	m215	LORENSON	And how do you know that?
L583936	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
L583935	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why not?
L583934	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't have time.
L583933	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why don't you help me?
L583931	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe.
L583930	u3250	m215	LORENSON	[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
L583927	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
L583926	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What about the world?
L583925	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
L583924	u3250	m215	LORENSON	The future doesn't look different?
L583923	u3252	m215	STARKS	It doesn't look all that different.
L583922	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
L583920	u3252	m215	STARKS	2004.
L583919	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well, what time is it?
L583918	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
L583917	u3252	m215	STARKS	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
L583916	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
L583913	u3252	m215	STARKS	This has nothing to do with that.
L583912	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
L583911	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't understand.
L583909	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
L583908	u3250	m215	LORENSON	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
L583907	u3252	m215	STARKS	You have no idea what's going on.
L583906	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What do you mean?
L583903	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll die either way.
L583902	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
L583857	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] We will.
L583856	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
L583855	u3252	m215	STARKS	Exactly.
L583854	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, it is.
L583853	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
L583849	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why would we do that?
L583848	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
L583846	u3252	m215	STARKS	My dad wrote some things down before he died.
L583845	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
L583844	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
L583843	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
L583842	u3252	m215	STARKS	But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
L583841	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I don't know.
L583840	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he get it?
L583831	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
L583830	u3252	m215	STARKS	What case?
L583828	u3252	m215	STARKS	You thought my father was crazy?
L583827	u3250	m215	LORENSON	At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
L583826	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583825	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
L583824	u3252	m215	STARKS	I never knew my father. Did you?
L583823	u3250	m215	LORENSON	My God you look exactly like him.
L583720	u3252	m215	STARKS	Believe me, I know.
L583719	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
L583718	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So it's helping?
L583717	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I don't want it to.
L583716	u3252	m215	STARKS	I could try to...make it stop.
L583715	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why, what would you do?
L583711	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
L583710	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
L583709	u3252	m215	STARKS	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
L583708	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You were convicted of the crime.
L583706	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're not crazy.
L583705	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
L583704	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I guess I'd ask you why.
L583703	u3252	m215	STARKS	And if I didn't want to come?
L583959	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
L583958	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker does? Are you sure?
L583957	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
L583956	u3252	m215	STARKS	MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
L583952	u3252	m215	STARKS	Is it true?
L583951	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?"
L583740	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
L583739	u3252	m215	STARKS	So what am I supposed to do?
L583738	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
L583737	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583736	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	It's gonna be sticky.
L583732	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
L583731	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
L583730	u3252	m215	STARKS	The Jacket.
L583729	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Beat] How do you know?
L583728	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
L583727	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
L583726	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
L583725	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I know you need one when it's really cold.
L583723	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
L583722	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I wasn't talking about anything.
L583721	u3252	m215	STARKS	What were you talking about the other day?
L583484	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
L583483	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
L583481	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
L583480	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't you go to jail for that?
L583479	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried to kill my wife.
L583477	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"TV. Helps numb [makes a ""crazy gesture""] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie."
L583476	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
L583475	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
L584079	u3253	m215	TENNY	Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
L584078	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L584077	u3253	m215	TENNY	Can you drive?
L584076	u3253	m215	TENNY	I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
L584075	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are you going?
L584074	u3253	m215	TENNY	Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
L583779	u3252	m215	STARKS	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
L583778	u3253	m215	TENNY	It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
L583777	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583776	u3253	m215	TENNY	You ever been to jail?
L583608	u3252	m215	STARKS	That when you stopped being a nurse?
L583607	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
L583606	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry.
L583605	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
L583604	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583603	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
L583602	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
L583601	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	I'm sorry.
L583600	u3252	m215	STARKS	I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
L583599	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	So you never knew your mother?
L583598	u3252	m215	STARKS	They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
L583597	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
L583596	u3252	m215	STARKS	But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
L583595	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You remember it?
L583594	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is a great song.
L583591	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
L583590	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't think that's crazy?
L583589	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] Real is overrated.
L583588	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why?
L583587	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, good for you.
L583585	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know, but I think part of it's...
L583584	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
L583583	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why'd you stop?
L583582	u3252	m215	STARKS	Have you always been a waitress?
L583581	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] I do it.
L583580	u3252	m215	STARKS	You like it?
L583579	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yup. That's me.
L583578	u3252	m215	STARKS	So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
L583577	u3252	m215	STARKS	Thanks.
L583576	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	This is pretty good. Considering...
L583575	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L583574	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You want a drink?
L583573	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
L583572	u3252	m215	STARKS	I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
L583571	u3252	m215	STARKS	The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
L583570	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	What's this?
L583567	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
L583566	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
L583564	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I'm ok.
L583563	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
L583562	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll manage.
L583561	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
L583560	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
L583559	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
L583557	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] Not around here.
L583556	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
L583555	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583554	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Do you have a motel or something? Money?
L583553	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I was dropped off.
L583552	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, how'd you get here?
L583548	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
L583547	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
L583546	u3252	m215	STARKS	"Why ""of course""?"
L583545	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Of course you don't know.
L583544	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
L583543	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, where are you from?
L583542	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't think so.
L583541	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You don't have anywhere to stay?
L583540	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583536	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
L583535	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583534	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
L583533	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thanks.
L583532	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
L583530	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Good.
L583529	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I'm not deaf.
L583528	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
L620989	u3327	m221	BENNY	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!

L621094	u3341	m221	QUAID	I am Quaid.
L621093	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
L621091	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
L621090	u3341	m221	QUAID	Do you expect me to believe you?
L621089	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.

L621012	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.

L621007	u3341	m221	QUAID	So why am I still alive?
L621006	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
L621005	u3341	m221	QUAID	Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
L621004	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
L621003	u3341	m221	QUAID	He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
L621002	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
L620998	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
L620997	u3341	m221	QUAID	Fuck you.

L620905	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
L620904	u3342	m221	RICHTER	They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
L620903	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Stop fighting and get out.
L620678	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
L620677	u3342	m221	RICHTER	Yes, sir.
L620676	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
L620675	u3342	m221	RICHTER	Yes, sir.
L620674	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
L620673	u3342	m221	RICHTER	But I thought...
L620672	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	I know that.
L620671	u3342	m221	RICHTER	He had help.  From our side, sir.
L620669	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
L620668	u3342	m221	RICHTER	No, sir.
L620667	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
L620546	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
L620545	u3342	m221	RICHTER	That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
L620544	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
L620543	u3342	m221	RICHTER	We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
L620542	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
L620541	u3342	m221	RICHTER	I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
L620540	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	What the fuck is going on down there?!

L620825	u3341	m221	QUAID	Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
L620824	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.

L620761	u3341	m221	QUAID	There's something I have to tell you...
L620760	u3340	m221	MELINA	...What?
L620756	u3340	m221	MELINA	You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
L620755	u3341	m221	QUAID	I guess he didn't.
L620754	u3340	m221	MELINA	I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
L620746	u3340	m221	MELINA	I think it's still hungry.
L620745	u3341	m221	QUAID	Blondes.
L620744	u3340	m221	MELINA	Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
L620254	u3340	m221	MELINA	I love you.
L620253	u3341	m221	QUAID	I love you.
L620579	u3341	m221	QUAID	What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
L620578	u3343	m221	STEVENS	We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
L620577	u3341	m221	QUAID	...Who are you?
L620576	u3343	m221	STEVENS	What?
L620575	u3341	m221	QUAID	Wait!
L620574	u3343	m221	STEVENS	I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
L620573	u3341	m221	QUAID	I gave you?
L620572	u3343	m221	STEVENS	This is the suitcase you gave me.
L645695	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Come on out!  We're friends!
L645694	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Hey, there - open up!
L645687	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
L645686	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Hey, how about that!
L645685	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	We'd be in all the papers!
L645684	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
L645673	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
L645672	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	It's no meteor, that's for sure!
L645671	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
L645670	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
L645665	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Let's go.
L645664	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
L645663	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
L645662	u3423	m226	ALONZO HOGUE	Looks almost cold now, don't it?
L645945	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
L645944	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
L645943	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
L645942	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	All right - I've seen enough!
L645941	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
L645924	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
L645923	u3424	m226	CHIEF OF STAFF	Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
L645922	u3435	m226	SECRETARY	That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
L646054	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	But I think I know where she'll be....
L646053	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	You look kinda lost yourself.
L646050	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
L646049	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	Hurry up!  Jump in!
L646046	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
L646045	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	There's nobody left around here now.
L646044	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
L646043	u3430	m226	M.P. DRIVER	Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
L646023	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Don't let's lose each other.
L646022	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
L646021	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
L646020	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I wonder if they're going through this too...?
L646019	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
L645988	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
L645987	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How'd you guess?
L645986	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
L645985	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	My kid brother has one.  You know why?
L645984	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
L645983	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
L645982	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
L645981	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
L645913	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
L645912	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They've blocked it!
L645909	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
L645908	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
L645907	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
L645905	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
L645904	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
L645903	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	What was it like?
L645902	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It was...  ...one of them!
L645901	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Nothing there now.
L645898	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Hours.  I've been so scared...!
L645897	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	How long was I out?
L645895	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
L645894	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
L645893	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I liked him.
L645892	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
L645891	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
L645890	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
L645889	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
L645888	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
L645887	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
L645886	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
L645885	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
L645884	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
L645883	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
L645882	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
L645881	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Don't you live at home?
L645880	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
L645878	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
L645877	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Where are we?
L645876	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's gone now.
L645875	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Is that... machine...?
L645874	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
L645873	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
L645844	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
L645843	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
L645842	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Sure...get in!
L645841	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Can you handle one of these?
L645840	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
L645789	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Would you like some coffee, General?
L645788	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
L645776	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
L645775	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
L645774	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
L645773	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	The troops are certainly moving in here!
L645720	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Automobile ignitions are insulated.
L645719	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How does it happen cars are running?
L645712	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
L645711	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They've all stopped at the same time.
L645640	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
L645639	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
L645638	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I didn't know how to stop you...!
L645637	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
L645636	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Like...ah...
L645635	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	What's he like?
L645634	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I do know him...slightly.
L645633	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	How can you say that when you don't know him!
L645632	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Aw, he isn't that good...!
L645631	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
L645630	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
L645629	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
L645628	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Did it do you any good?
L645627	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
L645626	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	You seem to know a lot about him.
L645625	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
L645624	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
L645623	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It hit sideways and skidded in.
L645622	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
L645621	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
L645620	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
L645619	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Did you see it come down?
L645617	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
L645616	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Is that it over there?
L645734	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
L645733	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
L645732	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	What is that gizmo?!
L645718	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
L645717	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	That needle ain't pointing north!
L645716	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Have you got a pocket compass?
L645715	u3436	m226	SHERIFF	How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
L645714	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	That's what knocked the phones out, too.
L646031	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
L646030	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	No.  I thought you had them.
L646029	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
L646017	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
L646016	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
L646015	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
L646014	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
L646013	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
L645968	u3429	m226	GRATZMAN	It might give us something.
L645967	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
L645598	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
L645597	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
L645596	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
L645595	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
L645592	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	Looks like the fishing was good.
L645591	u3425	m226	CLAYTON	Right.
L645590	u3427	m226	FIDDLER	I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
L645815	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
L645814	u3426	m226	COLONEL	It's always been a good persuader.
L645813	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Colonel - shooting's no good!
L645785	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
L645784	u3426	m226	COLONEL	I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
L645783	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	So is the town, I notice!
L645782	u3426	m226	COLONEL	There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
L645807	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	They'll probably move at dawn.
L645806	u3426	m226	COLONEL	Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
L645805	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
L645804	u3426	m226	COLONEL	My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
L645802	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
L645801	u3426	m226	COLONEL	We will, sir!
L645794	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
L645793	u3426	m226	COLONEL	Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
L645792	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
L645787	u3428	m226	GENERAL MANN	I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
L645786	u3426	m226	COLONEL	General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
L645823	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
L645822	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
L645819	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
L645818	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
L645817	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	They are living creatures out there.
L645659	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
L645658	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	They don't do much of anything...!
L645645	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
L645644	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
L645578	u3437	m226	SYLVIA	It was nearer than that.
L645577	u3431	m226	PASTOR COLLINS	That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
L645589	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
L645588	u3433	m226	RANGER	I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
L645587	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
L645586	u3433	m226	RANGER	We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
L645585	u3432	m226	RADIO VOICE	D.O. to number three..come in.
L645584	u3433	m226	RANGER	Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
L645693	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
L645692	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	They'll understand us, all right!
L645689	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Welcome to California!
L645688	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	What'll we say to 'em?
L645681	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
L645680	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Maybe these are not men - not like us.
L645678	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	How would I know...!
L645677	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
L645676	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Must be somebody in there.
L645609	u3434	m226	SALVADOR	We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
L645608	u3438	m226	WASH PERRY	Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
L10344	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	No way that could just be seawater.
L10343	u3520	m232	BUD	You done impressing yourself, ace?
L10257	u3520	m232	BUD	Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
L10256	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
L10255	u3520	m232	BUD	It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
L10254	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Okay, good reason.  Then what?
L10253	u3520	m232	BUD	We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
L10252	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
L10251	u3520	m232	BUD	There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
L10250	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
L10242	u3520	m232	BUD	Where're you?
L10241	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
L10212	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Piece of cake, baby.
L10211	u3520	m232	BUD	This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
L10191	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
L10190	u3520	m232	BUD	Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
L10267	u3528	m232	SONNY	What is that?  You drop your dive light?
L10266	u3520	m232	BUD	Nice shot, Lins.
L10227	u3520	m232	BUD	Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
L10226	u3528	m232	SONNY	Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
L10145	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
L10144	u3528	m232	SONNY	You got it?!  You got it?
L10121	u3528	m232	SONNY	I'm alright, I'm dealing.
L10120	u3520	m232	BUD	How you guys doing?
L9939	u3520	m232	BUD	We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
L9938	u3528	m232	SONNY	She-hit.
L10380	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
L10379	u3520	m232	BUD	Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
L10135	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Yeah, okay.  Okay.
L10134	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
L10133	u3524	m232	JAMMER	No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
L10132	u3520	m232	BUD	I'm taking you back out.
L10131	u3524	m232	JAMMER	I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
L10130	u3520	m232	BUD	Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
L10129	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you okay?
L10128	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Lord Almighty.
L10127	u3520	m232	BUD	Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
L10126	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Where are we?
L10081	u3524	m232	JAMMER	How deep's the drop-off here?
L10080	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay so far.
L9937	u3520	m232	BUD	Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
L9936	u3524	m232	JAMMER	What's goin' on, Boss?
L9920	u3520	m232	BUD	Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
L9919	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
L10587	u3520	m232	BUD	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
L10586	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hello, Brigman.
L10492	u3520	m232	BUD	Who then?
L10491	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No, Bud, no... not you.
L10489	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
L10488	u3520	m232	BUD	'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
L10487	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
L10486	u3520	m232	BUD	Hi, lady.
L10485	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
L10458	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Tell me later.
L10457	u3520	m232	BUD	Oh God, Lins... I--
L10455	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
L10454	u3520	m232	BUD	It is insane.
L10452	u3520	m232	BUD	WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
L10451	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
L10450	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the plan?
L10449	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
L10448	u3520	m232	BUD	FUCK LOGIC!!
L10447	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
L10446	u3520	m232	BUD	Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
L10445	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
L10444	u3520	m232	BUD	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
L10443	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
L10442	u3520	m232	BUD	Alright, put this on.
L10441	u3520	m232	BUD	Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
L10440	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
L10439	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
L10438	u3520	m232	BUD	I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
L10437	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We've only got one suit.
L10436	u3520	m232	BUD	I don't know how!
L10435	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	How?
L10434	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
L10433	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Calm down, Bud.
L10432	u3520	m232	BUD	Son of a bitch!
L10430	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know, look around.
L10429	u3520	m232	BUD	Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
L10428	u3520	m232	BUD	Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
L10427	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You see where it's coming in?
L10426	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
L10425	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	They'll come out after us.
L10424	u3520	m232	BUD	Good hundred yards, I'd say.
L10422	u3520	m232	BUD	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
L10421	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Well, that's that.
L10420	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
L10419	u3520	m232	BUD	Try again.
L10417	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You noticed.
L10416	u3520	m232	BUD	It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
L10415	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Yeah.  So sue me.
L10414	u3520	m232	BUD	You totaled it, huh?
L10413	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not in this thing.
L10412	u3520	m232	BUD	Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
L10411	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
L10409	u3520	m232	BUD	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
L10408	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You owe me one, Virgil.
L10386	u3520	m232	BUD	Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
L10385	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
L10384	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
L10383	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Now what?
L10382	u3520	m232	BUD	He's jammed the mechanism.
L10346	u3520	m232	BUD	Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
L10345	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
L10339	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It's trying to communicate.
L10338	u3520	m232	BUD	I think it likes you.
L10327	u3520	m232	BUD	Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
L10326	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	He's got the shakes?
L10320	u3520	m232	BUD	Chill out, Lindsey!!
L10319	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You dumb jarhead motherf--
L10311	u3520	m232	BUD	Lindsey!  Wait a second--
L10310	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
L10292	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
L10291	u3520	m232	BUD	How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
L10290	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
L10289	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
L10288	u3520	m232	BUD	No.
L10287	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
L10286	u3520	m232	BUD	God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
L10285	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
L10284	u3520	m232	BUD	All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
L10283	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
L10282	u3520	m232	BUD	Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
L10281	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, something really important is happening here.
L10280	u3520	m232	BUD	Jesus, Lindsey--
L10270	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
L10269	u3520	m232	BUD	If you say so.  It could be anything.
L10268	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
L10240	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Yeah?  Well I'm not.
L10239	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
L10238	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
L10237	u3520	m232	BUD	The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
L10236	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
L10235	u3520	m232	BUD	What about O-2?
L10234	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
L10233	u3520	m232	BUD	Need some help?
L10232	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
L10231	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the scoop, ace?
L10185	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Cute, Virgil.
L10184	u3520	m232	BUD	Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
L10166	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
L10165	u3520	m232	BUD	What do you think he saw?
L10164	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	But what did he see that made him panic?
L10163	u3520	m232	BUD	His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
L10162	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
L10161	u3520	m232	BUD	Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
L10160	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.
L10159	u3520	m232	BUD	But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
L10158	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
L10157	u3520	m232	BUD	Fine.  Be that way.
L10156	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
L10155	u3520	m232	BUD	Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
L10043	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
L10042	u3520	m232	BUD	I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
L10041	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
L10040	u3520	m232	BUD	What happened?
L10039	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
L10038	u3520	m232	BUD	"So what about ""Michael"" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?"
L10037	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
L10036	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
L10035	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I haven't worn mine in months.
L10034	u3520	m232	BUD	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
L10033	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What are you still wearing that for?
L10030	u3520	m232	BUD	Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
L10029	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
L10028	u3520	m232	BUD	No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
L10027	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	That must be it.
L10026	u3520	m232	BUD	I think you were worried about me.
L10025	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
L10024	u3520	m232	BUD	You wanna know what I think?
L10023	u3520	m232	BUD	Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
L10022	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
L10020	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
L10019	u3520	m232	BUD	I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
L10016	u3520	m232	BUD	Who else?
L10015	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
L10014	u3520	m232	BUD	You never did like being called that, did you?
L10013	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not for long.
L10012	u3520	m232	BUD	Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
L9970	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
L9969	u3520	m232	BUD	I'm switching off now.
L9968	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
L9967	u3520	m232	BUD	Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
L9966	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
L9965	u3520	m232	BUD	Your rig?
L9964	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
L9963	u3520	m232	BUD	Wasn't up to me.
L9962	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
L9961	u3520	m232	BUD	Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
L9960	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can't believe you let them do this!
L10229	u3522	m232	COFFEY	No.
L10228	u3520	m232	BUD	Did you find Wilhite?
L10210	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
L10209	u3520	m232	BUD	Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
L10116	u3520	m232	BUD	Let's go, guys.
L10115	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We'll go in through that large breach.
L10059	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
L10058	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
L10057	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I can't afford slack, Brigman.
L10056	u3520	m232	BUD	Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
L10053	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
L10052	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
L10474	u3520	m232	BUD	All right.  Do it!
L10473	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
L10472	u3520	m232	BUD	Is that it?  Is this right?
L10466	u3520	m232	BUD	Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
L10465	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Got it. Over.
L10464	u3520	m232	BUD	Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
L10325	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
L10324	u3520	m232	BUD	Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
L10309	u3523	m232	HIPPY	It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
L10308	u3520	m232	BUD	Why bring it here?
L10307	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Come on, man.  What else could it be?
L10247	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
L10246	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Do we just leave him there?
L10245	u3520	m232	BUD	That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
L10244	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That's Perry.
L10188	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Everything is.
L10187	u3520	m232	BUD	Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
L10186	u3523	m232	HIPPY	No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
L10181	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
L10180	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the matter with you?
L10098	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
L10097	u3520	m232	BUD	Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
L9974	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
L9973	u3520	m232	BUD	God, I hate that bitch.
L9972	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Virgil?
L10389	u3521	m232	CATFISH	I can't... make it... podner.
L10388	u3520	m232	BUD	Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
L10302	u3520	m232	BUD	Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
L10301	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Yuh?
L10300	u3520	m232	BUD	'Fish'?
L10141	u3521	m232	CATFISH	It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
L10140	u3520	m232	BUD	He's convulsing!
L10123	u3520	m232	BUD	We're here now.  Let's get her done.
L10122	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
L9918	u3521	m232	CATFISH	That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
L9917	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you guys are milking that job.
L10583	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
L10582	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
L10358	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
L10357	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
L10272	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
L10271	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Y'all could be more specific.
L10265	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Missed what?
L10264	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You better not say you missed that.
L10249	u3521	m232	CATFISH	You watch yourself.
L10248	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
L9993	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
L9992	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
L9991	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
L10401	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Give me that!!
L10400	u3523	m232	HIPPY	SHIT!
L10348	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
L10347	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
L10277	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
L10276	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Are we talkin' little space friend here?
L10169	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Turn it up, bozo.
L10168	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Quiet!  Quiet!
L10051	u3523	m232	HIPPY	What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
L10050	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Hippy, you pussy.
L10002	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
L10001	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
L10315	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
L10314	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
L10313	u3522	m232	COFFEY	You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
L10312	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
L10295	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
L10294	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
L10108	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
L10107	u3522	m232	COFFEY	24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
L10106	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	How many are there?
L10105	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
L10094	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Copy that.
L10093	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
L10092	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
L10089	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Wilhite, anything?
L10088	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Neutron counter's not showing very much.
L10087	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Cab One, radiation readings?
L10085	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
L10084	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Cab One, do you see it yet?
L10000	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
L9999	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
L9996	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
L9995	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
L9994	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
L9980	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
L9979	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
L10517	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What kind of luminous things, Bud?
L10516	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Uh, oh...
L10515	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
L10514	u3523	m232	HIPPY	12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
L10392	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
L10391	u3523	m232	HIPPY	He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
L10374	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
L10373	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
L10334	u3523	m232	HIPPY	I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
L10333	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
L10331	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
L10330	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
L10329	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
L10275	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
L10274	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	A non-terrestrial intelligence.
L10183	u3523	m232	HIPPY	We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
L10182	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Figured that out for yourself, did you?
L10078	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
L10077	u3523	m232	HIPPY	1840... 50... 60... 70...
L10076	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What's you depth, Cab Three?
L10075	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
L9988	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
L9987	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
L10366	u3526	m232	MONK	What's the timer set for?
L10365	u3523	m232	HIPPY	You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
L10113	u3523	m232	HIPPY	It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
L10112	u3526	m232	MONK	Getting a reading?
L10103	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
L10102	u3526	m232	MONK	Stand by on the ROV.
L10069	u3526	m232	MONK	Check this out.
L10068	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Hey!
L10065	u3526	m232	MONK	Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
L10064	u3523	m232	HIPPY	How deep?
L10063	u3526	m232	MONK	Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
L10540	u3526	m232	MONK	Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
L10539	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Would we see the flash?
L10535	u3526	m232	MONK	He's hallucinating badly.
L10534	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What kind of light?
L10529	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
L10528	u3526	m232	MONK	He can still make it.
L10520	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
L10519	u3526	m232	MONK	He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
L10506	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
L10505	u3526	m232	MONK	Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
L10504	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
L10502	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
L10501	u3526	m232	MONK	4800 feet.  It's official.
L9998	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
L9997	u3526	m232	MONK	High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
L23798	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
L23797	u3584	m236	ROBY	Do you remember the pyramid?
L23796	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	... I don't know...
L23795	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
L23792	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
L23791	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you in pain?
L23373	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
L23372	u3584	m236	ROBY	There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
L23371	u3584	m236	ROBY	Or something will be able to see us.
L23370	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
L23349	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
L23348	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engines off.
L23347	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Kill drive engines.
L23346	u3584	m236	ROBY	Locked.
L23321	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
L23320	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Hell, we're equipped --
L23319	u3584	m236	ROBY	If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
L23259	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
L23258	u3584	m236	ROBY	Cattle ranch!
L23257	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
L23245	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, it's you all right.
L23244	u3584	m236	ROBY	I feel like shit...
L23243	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Is that you, Roby?
L23242	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh... God... am I cold...
L23822	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
L23821	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Breathe deeply.
L23820	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
L23819	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23802	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
L23801	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
L23794	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	God I'm hungry.
L23793	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
L23790	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
L23789	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't you remember?
L23788	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Wretched.  What happened to me?
L23787	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do you feel, Dell?
L23554	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
L23553	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
L23552	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
L23551	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are you okay in there?
L23549	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take care.
L23548	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
L23545	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, I want to go in.
L23544	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
L23536	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you see anything in the hole?
L23535	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
L23534	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we come up?
L23531	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Sure.
L23530	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You want to try?
L23529	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Maybe we can get in by the top.
L23494	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it, I can't --
L23493	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
L23492	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Take a look.
L23491	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it?
L23490	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm on my way.
L23489	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
L23488	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's up?
L23487	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
L23486	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz.
L23444	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	But functioning.
L23443	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just machinery.
L23437	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, you'll follow me.
L23436	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll go first.
L23429	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
L23428	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Looks like a derelict.
L23427	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
L23401	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Receiving.
L23400	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
L23386	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
L23385	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Close enough to walk to!
L23345	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
L23344	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then take her down.
L23343	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	It's... basalt.  Rock.
L23342	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Is it solid?
L23341	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
L23340	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's the terrain down there?
L23339	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
L23336	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
L23335	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Activate lifter quads.
L23328	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll see what I can do.
L23327	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
L23323	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
L23322	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
L23313	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
L23312	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Gravity?
L23311	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah.  Two hours.
L23310	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any rotation?
L23307	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	That's what I'm going to do.
L23306	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you get it a little closer?
L23273	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
L23272	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Where the hell are we?
L23271	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I got it.  Oh boy.
L23270	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, plot our location.
L23269	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't recognize that constellation.
L23265	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, scan the whole sky.
L23264	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Where's Irth?
L23294	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
L23293	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
L23290	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Unknown.
L23289	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what language was that?
L23288	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Play it for us, please.
L23287	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have recorded the transmission.
L23285	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	A voice transmission.
L23284	u3585	m236	STANDARD	A transmission?
L23283	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
L23282	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
L24123	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
L24122	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
L23523	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
L23522	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
L23521	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23292	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
L23291	u3584	m236	ROBY	Unknown!  What do you mean?
L23281	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
L23280	u3584	m236	ROBY	What?  <u>Why</u>?
L23279	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
L23980	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's still in the ship?
L23979	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
L23978	u3581	m236	FAUST	Dead!
L23977	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dead.
L23976	u3581	m236	FAUST	What happened?  Where's Sandy?
L23921	u3581	m236	FAUST	All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
L23920	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where does that go?
L23885	u3581	m236	FAUST	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
L23884	u3584	m236	ROBY	What happened to the lights?
L23883	u3581	m236	FAUST	That way.
L23882	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.
L23879	u3581	m236	FAUST	Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
L23878	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where's it coming from?
L23850	u3584	m236	ROBY	We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
L23849	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
L23833	u3581	m236	FAUST	Shit...
L23832	u3584	m236	ROBY	But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
L23817	u3584	m236	ROBY	I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
L23816	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
L23815	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know what they make this stuff out of?
L23814	u3581	m236	FAUST	It grows on you.
L23813	u3584	m236	ROBY	You like this shit?
L23543	u3584	m236	ROBY	"It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  ""... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... ""  And that's all it could translate."
L23542	u3581	m236	FAUST	What do you mean?
L23541	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
L23540	u3581	m236	FAUST	Why, what's wrong?
L23539	u3584	m236	ROBY	Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
L23538	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes?  What is it?
L23520	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
L23519	u3581	m236	FAUST	Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
L23463	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
L23462	u3581	m236	FAUST	What?
L23461	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>He</u> died.
L23379	u3584	m236	ROBY	How's it coming on the engines?
L23378	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yeah!
L23377	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hello, Faust!
L23362	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.  Talk to you.
L23361	u3584	m236	ROBY	Well, get started.
L23360	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hard to say.
L23359	u3584	m236	ROBY	How long to fix?
L23355	u3584	m236	ROBY	Has the hull been breached?
L23354	u3581	m236	FAUST	Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
L23942	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Right.
L23941	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
L23925	u3582	m236	HUNTER	-- And the cooling unit on the other.
L23924	u3581	m236	FAUST	That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
L23838	u3581	m236	FAUST	The water will still recycle.
L23837	u3582	m236	HUNTER	And then we run out of food and oxygen.
L23827	u3581	m236	FAUST	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
L23826	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh, no.  Oh, no.
L23804	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
L23803	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
L23624	u3581	m236	FAUST	Is it alive?
L23623	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh -- God -- oh --
L23610	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
L23609	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hurt!  How?
L23608	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
L23607	u3581	m236	FAUST	What the hell's going on?
L23996	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And be right back.
L23995	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right. 
L23994	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
L23991	u3581	m236	FAUST	You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
L23990	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, I don't want us separated.
L23989	u3581	m236	FAUST	There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
L23973	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23972	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
L23971	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
L23927	u3581	m236	FAUST	Poison gas...
L23926	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
L23903	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well we better do something.
L23902	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
L23873	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
L23872	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's clear.
L23864	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I hope not.
L23863	u3581	m236	FAUST	Might even incinerate the damn thing.
L23844	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
L23843	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
L23842	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So does anybody have any suggestions?
L23812	u3581	m236	FAUST	I kind of like it.
L23811	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
L23775	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
L23774	u3581	m236	FAUST	This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
L23762	u3581	m236	FAUST	The engines are fixed.
L23761	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What?
L23760	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, guess what?
L23631	u3581	m236	FAUST	Here, let me try.
L23630	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's really on there tight.
L23470	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23469	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
L23468	u3581	m236	FAUST	Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
L23467	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And when will you be ready to do that?
L23466	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
L23465	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
L23358	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Damn it!  How long to fix?
L23357	u3581	m236	FAUST	Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
L23831	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
L23830	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
L23706	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
L23705	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
L23690	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
L23689	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It makes me sick to see him like that.
L23679	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
L23678	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
L23677	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
L23667	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It's eating a hole in the floor!
L23666	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	God, that smoke's poisonous!
L23661	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
L23660	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
L23659	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
L23658	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
L23650	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
L23649	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
L23648	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How does he breathe?
L23647	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
L23646	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Where did it come from?
L23640	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
L23639	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
L24100	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't, the acid will pour out!
L24099	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower!
L24098	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
L24097	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
L24081	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
L24080	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
L24078	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
L24077	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It will be.
L24073	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
L24072	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Should we go outside and bring him in?
L24071	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
L24057	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
L24056	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower needs more fuel.
L24055	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
L24051	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
L24050	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Good!  That's good!
L24049	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
L24031	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's time for drastic remedies.
L24030	u3582	m236	HUNTER	<u>How</u>?
L24029	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
L24028	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
L24021	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Does anybody know what happened?
L24020	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh my God.
L24019	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got six hours left.
L23988	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
L23987	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
L23986	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
L23982	u3582	m236	HUNTER	At least it can't get up here now.
L23981	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
L23936	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Got a better idea?
L23935	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Sounds like a rough one.
L23934	u3585	m236	STANDARD	While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
L23929	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
L23928	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
L23905	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't be an idiot.
L23904	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
L23866	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do we locate the creature?
L23865	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
L23852	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
L23851	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
L23742	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23741	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
L23740	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you do anything for him?
L23739	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes.
L23738	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still unconscious?
L23737	u3582	m236	HUNTER	He's running a fever.
L23736	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How's Broussard?
L23735	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes?
L23723	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe we can catch it.
L23722	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
L23721	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
L23720	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
L23719	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Now we're in for it.
L23717	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe it wasn't always dead.
L23716	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
L23715	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
L23714	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean?
L23713	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
L23712	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'll come with you.
L23711	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
L23672	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Careful, don't get under it!
L23671	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There.  Should be coming through about there.
L23636	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Ask him.
L23635	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey now, what is this?
L23628	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It wouldn't come.
L23627	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
L23253	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
L23252	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy, that's terrific.
L23251	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's over, Hunter.
L24089	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thanks for the thought. 
L24088	u3582	m236	HUNTER	If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
L24087	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is it armed?
L24086	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
L24083	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
L24082	u3584	m236	ROBY	"Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?"
L24076	u3584	m236	ROBY	I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
L24075	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This should do it.
L24054	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's not going to work.
L24053	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can use the flamethrower.
L24052	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
L24045	u3584	m236	ROBY	Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
L24044	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
L24041	u3584	m236	ROBY	And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
L24040	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Blow the ship up?
L24035	u3584	m236	ROBY	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
L24034	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
L24011	u3584	m236	ROBY	You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
L24010	u3582	m236	HUNTER	... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
L24004	u3584	m236	ROBY	And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
L24003	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
L24002	u3584	m236	ROBY	In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
L24001	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Recognizable!  In that?
L23993	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We sure need this flamethrower.
L23992	u3584	m236	ROBY	Don't count on it.
L23975	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
L23974	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
L23710	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
L23709	u3584	m236	ROBY	What common objects?
L23702	u3584	m236	ROBY	The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
L23701	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That must have been when he got it.
L23698	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey!  what about the film?
L23697	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This is horrible.
L23676	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's fizzled out.
L23675	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What's happening up here?
L23657	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
L23656	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
L23655	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh... God...
L23654	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
L23653	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
L23652	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look at that.
L23643	u3584	m236	ROBY	I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
L23642	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
L23604	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
L23603	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh no.
L23598	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Three blips!  They're coming this way!
L23597	u3584	m236	ROBY	How many?
L23596	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
L23565	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
L23564	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Why, you chickenshit bastard --
L23563	u3584	m236	ROBY	We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
L23562	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
L23561	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're not going anywhere.
L23560	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean, no?
L23559	u3584	m236	ROBY	No.
L23558	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
L23528	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
L23527	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What?  What was that?
L23512	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm trying.
L23511	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you get them back?
L23510	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've completely lost their signal.
L23509	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what's wrong?
L23956	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
L23955	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Okay.
L23954	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
L23953	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're getting pretty close now.
L23952	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's get moving with this net.
L23951	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're on the next level up.
L23950	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are they close?
L23949	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
L23861	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
L23860	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
L23859	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
L23858	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
L23857	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
L23856	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
L23855	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's the one about the albatross, right?
L23854	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I was thinking of a line from an old poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.""  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship."
L23853	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I thought I'd find you here.
L23848	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
L23847	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	And what do we do when we find it?
L23846	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Room by room, corridor by corridor.
L23845	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	How?
L23836	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got about a week left, right?
L23835	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
L23834	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
L23807	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we could write it together.
L23806	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The commander normally has first publication rights.
L23805	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it ""The Snark Log."""
L23800	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're going into the freezers now.
L23799	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
L23758	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
L23757	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
L23708	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
L23707	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That sounds a little fanciful...
L23688	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to have healed itself.
L23687	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still dripping?
L23686	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, thank God... just missed him.
L23683	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
L23682	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
L23681	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Yes, thank heaven.
L23680	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stopped?
L23634	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's let the machine work on him.
L23633	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
L23595	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
L23594	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What is it?
L23593	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It won't come -- it's stuck.
L23592	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
L23591	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Oh God, oh God no.
L23590	u3585	m236	STANDARD	<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
L23589	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>What is it</u>?
L23584	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Can you see anything?
L23583	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it's coming.
L23582	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
L23581	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There, it caught!
L23578	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
L23577	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
L23576	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
L23575	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
L23569	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sun will be down in a minute.
L23568	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
L23557	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
L23556	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What'd he say?
L23514	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
L23513	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	This looks ancient.
L23497	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
L23496	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
L23431	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Who knows?
L23430	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Air lock?
L23421	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
L23420	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How far?
L23419	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's close, real close.
L23414	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My signal's fading.
L23413	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23408	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You lead.
L23407	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That way.
L23403	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
L23402	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Receiving.
L23375	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
L23374	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
L23369	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
L23368	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
L23303	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell -- show me that on a screen.
L23302	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
L23300	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
L23299	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the frequency?
L23298	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
L23297	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	First contact...
L23263	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Feast your eyes.
L23262	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
L23810	u3584	m236	ROBY	Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
L23809	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
L23808	u3584	m236	ROBY	First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
L23756	u3584	m236	ROBY	Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
L23755	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
L23752	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
L23751	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah?
L23750	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We do know that.
L23745	u3584	m236	ROBY	About four hours.
L23744	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
L23696	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
L23695	u3584	m236	ROBY	That tube must be depositing it in him.
L23694	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
L23384	u3584	m236	ROBY	Close...
L23383	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
L23332	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
L23331	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
L23325	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look --
L23324	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
L24113	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24112	u3584	m236	ROBY	What can I do?
L24111	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No good... it's eaten too much of me...
L24110	u3584	m236	ROBY	But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
L24109	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... don't...
L24108	u3584	m236	ROBY	I'll get you out of there.
L24107	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
L24106	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look...
L24105	u3584	m236	ROBY	What did it do to you?
L24104	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24093	u3584	m236	ROBY	Kablooey.
L24092	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
L24091	u3584	m236	ROBY	And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
L24090	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
L24085	u3584	m236	ROBY	Who gets the privilege?
L24084	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
L24068	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
L24067	u3584	m236	ROBY	So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
L24064	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
L24063	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>Hey watch it</u>!
L24062	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here, carry these.
L24061	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
L24048	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
L24047	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah... I forgot.
L24046	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
L24043	u3584	m236	ROBY	Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
L24042	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
L24039	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
L24038	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That'll blow the ship up.
L24037	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
L24036	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L24033	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
L24032	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was time for that a couple days ago.
L24027	u3584	m236	ROBY	No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
L24026	u3585	m236	STANDARD	At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
L24025	u3584	m236	ROBY	Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
L24024	u3584	m236	ROBY	No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
L24023	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we get to him?
L24022	u3584	m236	ROBY	I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
L24013	u3584	m236	ROBY	... More spores coming.
L24012	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Which presumably means...
L24009	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
L24008	u3584	m236	ROBY	This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
L24006	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the next step should be --
L24005	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
L24000	u3584	m236	ROBY	I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
L23999	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
L23998	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you make out any pattern in all that?
L23985	u3584	m236	ROBY	Nothing.
L23984	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's that supposed to mean?
L23983	u3584	m236	ROBY	Two down, four to go.
L23969	u3584	m236	ROBY	By eating our food supplies.
L23968	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How did it get so <u>big</u>?
L23948	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right now let's keep it closed.
L23947	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
L23938	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's be democratic.
L23937	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
L23931	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
L23930	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you <u>crazy</u>?
L23916	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What do you think?  Now we go in.
L23915	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23913	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Go ahead, Jay.
L23912	u3584	m236	ROBY	This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
L23909	u3584	m236	ROBY	You win.
L23908	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
L23907	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
L23900	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I guess we open the door and net it.
L23899	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23898	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
L23897	u3584	m236	ROBY	What's it doing, having a seizure?
L23895	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're coming!
L23894	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Food-storage room!
L23893	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are you?
L23892	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
L23891	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23870	u3584	m236	ROBY	Even simple.
L23869	u3585	m236	STANDARD	These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
L23841	u3584	m236	ROBY	But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
L23840	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
L23839	u3584	m236	ROBY	We won't need it then.
L23784	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
L23783	u3584	m236	ROBY	We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
L23782	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
L23781	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Quit complaining; we're in space.
L23780	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
L23778	u3584	m236	ROBY	With great pleasure.
L23777	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
L23776	u3584	m236	ROBY	We made it!  Damn, we made it!
L23771	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's take her into an escape orbit.
L23770	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engaged.
L23767	u3584	m236	ROBY	Up one kilometer, Jay.
L23766	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take us up.
L23754	u3585	m236	STANDARD	They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
L23753	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where did the parasites come from?
L23749	u3584	m236	ROBY	If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
L23748	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
L23747	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
L23746	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
L23728	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is that its mouth?
L23727	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
L23700	u3584	m236	ROBY	Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
L23699	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What film?
L23645	u3585	m236	STANDARD	He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
L23644	u3584	m236	ROBY	Would somebody fill me in?
L23638	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23637	u3584	m236	ROBY	I understand why you did that.
L23620	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
L23619	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
L23618	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can't leave him out here, open the door.
L23617	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
L23616	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
L23615	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
L23614	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
L23613	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
L23612	u3584	m236	ROBY	Here, Chaz.
L23602	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
L23601	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
L23600	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
L23599	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, can you guys hear me?
L23485	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
L23484	u3584	m236	ROBY	This ship is full of cat hair.
L23483	u3584	m236	ROBY	But why draw it on the wall?
L23482	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
L23481	u3584	m236	ROBY	What would you say that was supposed to mean?
L23480	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
L23479	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh well... you know me.
L23478	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still worried?
L23477	u3584	m236	ROBY	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
L23476	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Find anything we missed?
L23458	u3584	m236	ROBY	What killed it?
L23457	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But?
L23456	u3584	m236	ROBY	I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
L23455	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin?
L23424	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
L23423	u3584	m236	ROBY	Found what?
L23422	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, uh, we've found it.
L23411	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
L23410	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
L23396	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
L23395	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
L23394	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Anything else?
L23393	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not a one.  It's dead.
L23392	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any microorganisms?
L23391	u3584	m236	ROBY	Zero.  Dry as a bone.
L23390	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good!  Moisture content?
L23389	u3584	m236	ROBY	Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
L23388	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
L23387	u3584	m236	ROBY	10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
L23382	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
L23381	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay. 
L23353	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engine room, what happened?
L23352	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What the hell happened?
L23338	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Turn on navigation lights.
L23337	u3584	m236	ROBY	Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
L23330	u3584	m236	ROBY	No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
L23329	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's out of focus.
L23296	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, it's finally happened.
L23295	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh my God.
L23278	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
L23277	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L23276	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
L23275	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
L23267	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, contact traffic control.
L23266	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are we?
L23261	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right.  Fire up all systems.
L23260	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
L27233	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Yeah...
L27232	u3597	m237	REVNA	Better?
L27229	u3597	m237	REVNA	Do you want a tablet?
L27228	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
L27227	u3597	m237	REVNA	What is it?
L27205	u3597	m237	REVNA	Sure.
L27204	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
L27188	u3597	m237	REVNA	Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
L27187	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
L27186	u3597	m237	REVNA	Headache?  Dehydration?
L27116	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Wait a minute.
L27115	u3598	m237	YORK	Let's get back and call this in.
L27112	u3598	m237	YORK	Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
L27111	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
L27110	u3598	m237	YORK	I told you we... what's that?
L27109	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
L27108	u3598	m237	YORK	Yeah, it's fine.
L27107	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
L27106	u3598	m237	YORK	Is it dead?
L27105	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	It's a rhino.
L27103	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
L27102	u3598	m237	YORK	Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
L27068	u3598	m237	YORK	Do you wanna head back and call it in?
L27067	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
L27140	u3595	m237	MINH	Yep...
L27139	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Minh...
L27137	u3595	m237	MINH	Oh man...
L27136	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
L27032	u3595	m237	MINH	Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
L27031	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
L27030	u3595	m237	MINH	Thanks.
L27029	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Nice howitzer you've got there.
L27560	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Keep trying!
L27559	u3588	m237	CASSIE	I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
L27557	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Get her on-line.  Now!
L27556	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
L27555	u3596	m237	PARSONS	And?
L27554	u3588	m237	CASSIE	I found it...
L27552	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
L27551	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
L27550	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Where is she?
L27533	u3596	m237	PARSONS	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
L27532	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Are you alright?
L27467	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We're not gonna make it, are we?
L27466	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Give or take.
L27405	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Too many.
L27404	u3588	m237	CASSIE	How many of them are there?
L27401	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We're what!?
L27400	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
L27399	u3588	m237	CASSIE	What's happening?
L27398	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Seal everything now!
L27058	u3588	m237	CASSIE	It's on the board.
L27057	u3596	m237	PARSONS	A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
L27056	u3588	m237	CASSIE	What do you need?
L27052	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Okay, give me the numbers.
L27051	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
L27011	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
L27010	u3596	m237	PARSONS	We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
L27009	u3588	m237	CASSIE	A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
L26987	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Better tell the boss.
L26986	u3596	m237	PARSONS	That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
L27007	u3588	m237	CASSIE	No, but I got something that might interest you.
L27006	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
L27005	u3588	m237	CASSIE	You win some, you loose some.
L27004	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
L27003	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
L27002	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Shit.  When?
L27001	u3588	m237	CASSIE	MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
L27589	u3588	m237	CASSIE	But...
L27588	u3593	m237	HIROKO	If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
L27507	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
L27506	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Deal.
L27505	u3588	m237	CASSIE	About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
L27504	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How much air-time have I got?
L27484	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
L27483	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Oh, man...
L27460	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Do it.
L27459	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Not yet.
L27458	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Has anybody talked to them?
L27457	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
L27454	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What's our weapons situation?
L27453	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
L27446	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Nooooo!
L27445	u3588	m237	CASSIE	It's too late!
L27239	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Force the door.
L27238	u3588	m237	CASSIE	The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
L27237	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What's going on?
L27060	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Match it!
L27059	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Picking up velocity.
L27046	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
L27045	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
L27044	u3593	m237	HIROKO	When?
L27022	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
L27021	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Where're they headed?
L27013	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
L27012	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
L27595	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Couple more seconds!
L27594	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
L27349	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
L27348	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Is it still moving?
L27347	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	It's alright, it's cool...
L27346	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
L27345	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.  Might be a glitch.
L27344	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	How?
L27343	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Wait.  Lost it.
L27342	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I...
L27341	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
L27340	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Just behind us, over to the right.
L27339	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?  Where?
L27338	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I'm picking up another signal.
L27337	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What's wrong?
L27336	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hold it, hold it...
L27330	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
L27329	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Still got him?
L27327	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I got it.
L27326	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Careful of that edging there...
L27325	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Anything you say, Mammacitta.
L27324	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	But I'm going first...
L27323	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	I'll come with you.
L27322	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What?
L27321	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Alright, okay.  Look...
L27319	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
L27318	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What the hell are you doing?
L27317	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
L27316	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
L27315	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Forget it, man.
L27314	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
L27313	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
L27301	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Just got a reading...
L27300	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?
L27299	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Whoa, wait a minute...
L27298	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	That's a fact.
L27297	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
L27296	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
L27295	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
L27294	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	One of 'em must have escaped.
L27293	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Take a look at this.
L27292	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What?
L27291	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Hey, Guttierez?
L27279	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.
L27278	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Something spooking the rhinos?
L27277	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
L27276	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Yeah?
L27275	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	De Vries?
L27274	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
L27273	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Listen to what?
L27271	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
L27270	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
L27269	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
L27268	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
L27260	u3593	m237	HIROKO	One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
L27259	u3590	m237	DILLER	Okay.
L27258	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
L27250	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Where does that lead to?
L27249	u3590	m237	DILLER	Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
L27236	u3590	m237	DILLER	York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
L27235	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What happened?
L27042	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Thanks.
L27041	u3590	m237	DILLER	Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
L27513	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How tight are these shafts?
L27512	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
L27509	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sounds great.
L27508	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
L27493	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Uh-huh.
L27492	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Is this the suit?
L27490	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Which mean physically going outside.
L27489	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
L27488	u3593	m237	HIROKO	That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
L27456	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Auto-shop?
L27455	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
L27214	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
L27213	u3594	m237	KAMEN	And...?
L27164	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Appreciate that.
L27163	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
L27162	u3594	m237	KAMEN	She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
L27161	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What's the problem?
L27160	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
L27575	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
L27574	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, I'm out of here!
L27571	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
L27570	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, we're in business.
L27524	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
L27523	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
L27522	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
L27521	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
L27520	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Thanks.
L27516	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
L27515	u3596	m237	PARSONS	There's still time to back-out.
L27511	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What?  Why?
L27510	u3596	m237	PARSONS	It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
L27470	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Well... try the headset.
L27469	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
L27464	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Looks like it.
L27463	u3593	m237	HIROKO	They knocked out the external feeds.
L27452	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How many... how many people are missing?
L27451	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
L27252	u3593	m237	HIROKO	You've checked that end?
L27251	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
L27248	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What is that?
L27247	u3596	m237	PARSONS	It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
L27055	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
L27054	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Compensate!
L27053	u3596	m237	PARSONS	They've changed their heading again.
L27048	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
L27047	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Already working on it.
L27025	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
L27024	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
L27016	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Done it already.  Nothing matches.
L27015	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
L27014	u3596	m237	PARSONS	That's what we thought.
L27616	u3593	m237	HIROKO	No!
L27615	u3594	m237	KAMEN	You have to...
L27614	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I... I can't!
L27613	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
L27612	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What can I do?
L27611	u3594	m237	KAMEN	They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
L27435	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Don't wait for me!
L27434	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Hurry it up.
L27423	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
L27422	u3593	m237	HIROKO	That's the wrong way!
L27393	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
L27392	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What?
L27267	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
L27266	u3593	m237	HIROKO	So, what do you think?
L27256	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
L27255	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
L27207	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
L27206	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Do you believe him?
L27178	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
L27177	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Think I spoke too soon...
L27173	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What do you mean?
L27172	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
L27171	u3593	m237	HIROKO	When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
L27170	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Agreed.
L27169	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
L27154	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Hold on...
L27153	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I've found Ackland!
L27152	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Check out the tent.
L27151	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Yeah.  Somebody won.
L27100	u3594	m237	KAMEN	There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
L27099	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
L27098	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
L27096	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
L27095	u3594	m237	KAMEN	'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
L27094	u3593	m237	HIROKO	First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
L27093	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
L27092	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Any luck raising Ackland's party?
L27090	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Want some?
L27089	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Seltzer?
L27088	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Real man' drink.
L27087	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What is that?
L27085	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
L27084	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
L27083	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Only six?
L27082	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Six month stint on Datus.
L27081	u3594	m237	KAMEN	And before that?
L27080	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Four.
L27079	u3594	m237	KAMEN	How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
L27078	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
L27077	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Is that a fact.
L27076	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
L27075	u3593	m237	HIROKO	No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
L27074	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Not too much of the socializing type, then?
L27073	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
L27072	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
L27071	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
L27070	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
L27035	u3593	m237	HIROKO	We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
L27034	u3594	m237	KAMEN	See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
L27310	u3596	m237	PARSONS	You got it, cowboy.
L27309	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Give me a yell is something happens.
L27308	u3596	m237	PARSONS	'Bout five minutes.
L27307	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What time's sundown?
L27306	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
L27305	u3594	m237	KAMEN	You should hit the sack, too.
L27304	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
L27303	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
L27302	u3594	m237	KAMEN	How's it going?
L27020	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Tactical nukes, maybe?
L27019	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
L27018	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Jesus.
L27000	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
L26999	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Where'd you leave them?
L61018	u3824	m253	BIFF	Where's your old man?
L61017	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61016	u3824	m253	BIFF	Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
L61015	u3829	m253	MARTY	The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
L61014	u3824	m253	BIFF	Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
L61013	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61012	u3824	m253	BIFF	Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
L61261	u3825	m253	CLERK	No....
L61260	u3829	m253	MARTY	And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
L61259	u3825	m253	CLERK	Uh, yes, sir...
L61258	u3829	m253	MARTY	This is 1952....?
L61257	u3825	m253	CLERK	I beg your pardon?
L61256	u3829	m253	MARTY	I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
L61255	u3825	m253	CLERK	Yes, sir!
L61254	u3829	m253	MARTY	This... is the number one single?
L60936	u3826	m253	DICK	I don't know. National Cash Register?
L60935	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's N.R.C.?
L60934	u3826	m253	DICK	Third time they've been out there this week.
L60933	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
L60932	u3826	m253	DICK	Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
L60931	u3829	m253	MARTY	Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
L60930	u3826	m253	DICK	Marty. What's for breakfast?
L60929	u3829	m253	MARTY	Morning Dick.
L61486	u3829	m253	MARTY	You do?
L61485	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I think I know exactly what you mean.
L61483	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
L61482	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
L61478	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
L61477	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
L61476	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
L61475	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
L61429	u3829	m253	MARTY	Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
L61428	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty!
L61370	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
L61369	u3829	m253	MARTY	He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
L61368	u3829	m253	MARTY	But he does! Don't you see?
L61367	u3827	m253	EILEEN	But he didn't ask me.
L61366	u3829	m253	MARTY	George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
L61314	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah. Maybe so.
L61313	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
L61312	u3829	m253	MARTY	What time does school start around here?
L61311	u3829	m253	MARTY	School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
L61310	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Then you'll be going to school here....?
L61307	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
L61306	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
L61305	u3829	m253	MARTY	How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
L61304	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You remember me...?
L61302	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, hi....
L61301	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty.
L61189	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Have we ever met before?
L61188	u3829	m253	MARTY	Huh?
L61185	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Poly-what?
L61184	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's polyester.
L61182	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, thanks...
L61181	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Here's your jacket!
L61167	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Seventeen.
L61166	u3829	m253	MARTY	How old are you?
L61009	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
L61008	u3829	m253	MARTY	Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
L61007	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean you're going to stay up all night?
L60991	u3827	m253	EILEEN	That's good.
L60990	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60989	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Learn anything?
L60988	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine.
L60987	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How was school today?
L60977	u3829	m253	MARTY	I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
L60976	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
L61402	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
L61401	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How are you?
L61400	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Uh, hi, Eileen.
L61362	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No!
L61361	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
L60999	u3827	m253	EILEEN	George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
L60998	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Eileen, Chinese food again?
L60997	u3827	m253	EILEEN	By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
L60986	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Coming, Eileen...
L60985	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
L61456	u3829	m253	MARTY	No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
L61455	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Maybe if I used my left....
L61452	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
L61451	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
L61450	u3829	m253	MARTY	Your line, George!
L61449	u3829	m253	MARTY	George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
L61448	u3828	m253	GEORGE	You mean, you're gonna --
L61446	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why is she gonna get angry with you?
L61445	u3829	m253	MARTY	Why what?
L61444	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why?
L61443	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
L61442	u3828	m253	GEORGE	In the parking lot, with her.
L61441	u3829	m253	MARTY	And where am I gonna be?
L61440	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I'm going to be at the dance.
L61439	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
L61438	u3828	m253	GEORGE	But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
L61437	u3829	m253	MARTY	How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
L61436	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
L61435	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
L61434	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
L61395	u3829	m253	MARTY	Bic... It's a Bic pen.
L61394	u3828	m253	GEORGE	'Bike fine point?'
L61393	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Lemme see that.
L61392	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
L61391	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
L61390	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
L61389	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Huh?
L61388	u3829	m253	MARTY	Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
L61387	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
L61386	u3829	m253	MARTY	Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
L61385	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What do I say?
L61381	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, then!
L61380	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Well... yeah...
L61379	u3829	m253	MARTY	George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
L61360	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Not now....
L61359	u3829	m253	MARTY	You've gotta ask her to the dance!
L61006	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
L61005	u3828	m253	GEORGE	The sunrise? What for?
L61002	u3829	m253	MARTY	Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
L61001	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No, Chinese food is fine.
L60996	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Good.
L60995	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60994	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Learn anything?
L60993	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine..
L60981	u3829	m253	MARTY	The drill!  The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
L60980	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What drill?
L60979	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dad, you seen the drill?
L61343	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Run out of gas?
L61342	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
L61341	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
L61340	u3829	m253	MARTY	Who, me?
L61320	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty. Marty Lewis.
L61319	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You have a name?
L61318	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
L61317	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
L60953	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
L60952	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
L60951	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, explode it up your ass!
L60950	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
L60949	u3829	m253	MARTY	You know damn well that's not what I meant.
L60948	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
L60947	u3829	m253	MARTY	Not a holocaust --
L60946	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
L61153	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Nineteen fifty --
L61152	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year?
L61151	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	March 11th.
L61150	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator, what's today's date?
L61149	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	I'm sorry, there's no answer.
L61148	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Five cents, please.
L61147	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
L61146	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
L61145	u3829	m253	MARTY	What?
L61144	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Sir, it only costs a nickel.
L61143	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
L61142	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Operator...
L61106	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro! Release the rope!
L61105	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	What?!
L61053	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah,  Right.
L61052	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
L61047	u3829	m253	MARTY	Home, school, here... 
L61046	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
L61043	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
L61042	u3829	m253	MARTY	What, am I radioactive or something?
L61039	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's this all about?
L61038	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
L61657	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
L61656	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pretty, isn't it?
L61654	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The Orpheum.
L61653	u3829	m253	MARTY	What theater was I at?
L61652	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
L61651	u3829	m253	MARTY	Obviously!  
L61650	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
L61649	u3829	m253	MARTY	But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
L61648	u3829	m253	MARTY	87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
L61647	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
L61644	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A car.
L61643	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you call this? 
L61642	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61639	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
L61638	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year is this?
L61571	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
L61570	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
L61566	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
L61565	u3829	m253	MARTY	Thanks for everything, Pro.
L61561	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
L61560	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
L61542	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious...  Very curious.
L61541	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
L61540	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You didn't?
L61472	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
L61471	u3829	m253	MARTY	Perfect...
L61470	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	There's no way of knowing.
L61469	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
L61468	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
L61467	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just what I needed to hear.
L61466	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
L61465	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
L61464	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
L61463	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
L61462	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61461	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's all taken care of.
L61425	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jesus!
L61424	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
L61423	u3829	m253	MARTY	Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
L61422	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
L61421	u3829	m253	MARTY	But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
L61420	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	My guess is that she turned him down.
L61419	u3829	m253	MARTY	But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
L61418	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
L61414	u3829	m253	MARTY	Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
L61413	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
L61412	u3829	m253	MARTY	I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
L61411	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Where did you get this?
L61376	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
L61375	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
L61372	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You did what?!?
L61371	u3829	m253	MARTY	I know.
L61298	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious... Very curious....
L61297	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, it was there.
L61296	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't recall ever seeing it before.
L61295	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
L61294	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Say, where did this guitar come from?
L61291	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
L61290	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
L61289	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
L61288	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, be serious, would you?
L61287	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	An atomic bomb.
L61250	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
L61249	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
L61247	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
L61246	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
L61245	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
L61244	u3829	m253	MARTY	What if you lost your keys?
L61243	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
L61242	u3829	m253	MARTY	You were ringing the doorbell!
L61241	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You answered the door!
L61232	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just great!
L61231	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
L61222	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We don't....
L61221	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
L61219	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
L61218	u3829	m253	MARTY	How did you know?
L61215	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
L61214	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
L61213	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
L61212	u3829	m253	MARTY	The power converter...
L61211	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
L61205	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
L61204	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pardon me?
L61202	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
L61201	u3829	m253	MARTY	You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
L61200	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
L61196	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
L61195	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A mall?
L61194	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
L61193	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, yeah.
L61192	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
L61191	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
L61175	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
L61174	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty.
L61173	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
L61171	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Ssshhhhh!
L61170	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
L61169	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You know me?
L61168	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor? Professor Brown?
L61092	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure, he agreed quickly.
L61091	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
L61090	u3829	m253	MARTY	All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
L61089	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
L61088	u3829	m253	MARTY	So what? We'd be rich!
L61087	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty, that would alter history.
L61085	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
L61084	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A gold mine?
L61081	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
L61080	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
L61079	u3829	m253	MARTY	Is Shemp all right?
L61078	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
L61073	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Why?
L61072	u3829	m253	MARTY	The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
L61068	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Precisely! 
L61067	u3829	m253	MARTY	A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
L61064	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
L61063	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
L61062	u3829	m253	MARTY	The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
L61061	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
L61060	u3829	m253	MARTY	Then where the hell is he?
L61059	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
L61057	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
L61056	u3829	m253	MARTY	But Professor --
L60928	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	...To be traveled through
L60927	u3829	m253	MARTY	Catch you later! 
L60925	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
L60924	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh, right, right... 
L60923	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro, the sun's out!
L60922	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	AM or PM?
L60921	u3829	m253	MARTY	Eight thirty.
L60920	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
L60919	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
L60918	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
L60915	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
L60914	u3829	m253	MARTY	That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
L60913	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
L60911	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shhhhhhhh!
L60910	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
L61127	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
L61126	u3829	m253	MARTY	What happened to Dick Wilson?
L61125	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	I run this place! 
L61124	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
L61123	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick? Dick who?
L61122	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
L61120	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure,.
L61119	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
L61114	u3829	m253	MARTY	A Tab.
L61113	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	What? 
L61112	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
L61682	u3834	m253	SUZY	What did you do to yours?
L61681	u3829	m253	MARTY	What did you do to your hair?
L61680	u3834	m253	SUZY	Hi, Marty!
L61679	u3829	m253	MARTY	Suzy!
L61032	u3834	m253	SUZY	Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
L61031	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
L61030	u3834	m253	SUZY	Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
L61029	u3829	m253	MARTY	No way!
L61028	u3834	m253	SUZY	Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
L61027	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
L61026	u3834	m253	SUZY	No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
L61025	u3829	m253	MARTY	...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
L64058	u3848	m255	BILLY	Then that's it!
L64057	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	"Halloween. 1938...""War of the Worlds""...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax."
L64056	u3848	m255	BILLY	You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
L64055	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
L64052	u3848	m255	BILLY	Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
L64051	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	New Jersey?
L64050	u3848	m255	BILLY	All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
L64022	u3848	m255	BILLY	Who're you?
L64021	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
L64182	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	They're stealing my chopper!
L64181	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's another one we owe 'em.
L64108	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
L64107	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	Not me. No way.
L64106	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You wanna take the chance, Casper?
L64105	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
L64032	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
L64031	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
L63991	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
L63990	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Planet 10?
L63989	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
L63988	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
L63987	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
L63986	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	It's your hand, Buckaroo.
L63985	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
L63983	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
L63982	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	What?
L63981	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
L63980	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
L63892	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
L63891	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
L63882	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
L63881	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
L63773	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
L63772	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
L63746	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
L63745	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
L64180	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
L64179	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	We will, old fried, we will.
L64173	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	So I was right.  That's nice to know...
L64172	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoid.
L64171	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Apache?
L64170	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Just 'grazed' you, huh?
L64169	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	You're a welcome sight...
L64162	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
L64161	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You okay?
L63950	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
L63949	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
L63948	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	What crate?
L63947	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	The deuce you say.  That crate!
L63946	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
L63945	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
L63911	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
L63910	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
L63834	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
L63833	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
L63832	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
L63830	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	First thing I did.
L63829	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Have you warned Professor Hikita?
L63828	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
L63824	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Vanished. Thin air.
L63823	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Then what?
L63771	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Same one you had yesterday?
L63770	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Got a half a tuna sandwich.
L63769	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm starving...somebody, help.
L64416	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
L64415	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
L64235	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
L64234	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
L64154	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Where's the professor?
L64153	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Dead.  Damnit!
L64148	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
L64147	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is it, Tommy?
L64146	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo--! Sorry--
L64089	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It?  Who does?
L64088	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
L64081	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
L64080	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
L63879	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Let her out?  She's a killer.
L63878	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Let her out. In my custody.
L63877	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Running a little late, Buckaroo.
L63836	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
L63835	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
L63790	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
L63789	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
L63786	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	She wants a picture.
L63785	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Not really.  This is pretty important.
L63784	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
L63778	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
L63777	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Anybody we know?
L64410	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Now!
L64409	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
L64408	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
L64403	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64402	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
L64398	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
L64397	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64382	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	The door's locked.
L64381	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	We're going down!  Onto the runway!
L64372	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
L64371	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is this thing?  A fighter?
L64246	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
L64245	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
L64419	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
L64418	u3862	m255	RENO	Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
L64417	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Got a casualty list?
L64232	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
L64231	u3862	m255	RENO	They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
L64184	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't shoot!
L64183	u3862	m255	RENO	And they got Penny!  Look!
L64111	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	To get my guns.
L64110	u3862	m255	RENO	Where're you goin'?
L64087	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
L64086	u3862	m255	RENO	...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
L64083	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
L64082	u3862	m255	RENO	...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
L64078	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What? How do you know that?
L64077	u3862	m255	RENO	They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
L63775	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
L63774	u3862	m255	RENO	And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
L64240	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Penny--?!  Are you all right?
L64239	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
L64150	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
L64149	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stay here, I'll be back.
L64145	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
L64144	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's too dangerous.
L64143	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
L64142	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Absolutely.
L64141	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Believe in Penny Priddy?
L64140	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
L64139	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
L64138	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
L64137	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Go where?  Where're you going?
L64136	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
L64135	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
L64134	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Never.
L64132	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I wish he was.  He's real enough.
L64131	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
L64130	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
L64129	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
L64128	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You don't wanna know.
L64127	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	How did she die?  I wanna know.
L64126	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
L64125	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
L64124	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
L64123	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Oh, my.
L64122	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was killed, Penny.
L64121	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
L64114	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
L64113	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Open up or I'll shoot it off.
L63904	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Any time.
L63903	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You keep an eye on it.
L63876	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
L63875	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
L63874	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
L63873	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
L63872	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Another 'you'?
L63871	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
L63870	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
L63869	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Which?  The one in my throat.
L63868	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
L63867	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	No, I don't.
L63866	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
L63865	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
L63864	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
L63863	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
L63862	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	It's kinda hard this way.
L63861	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
L63860	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	The girl I remind you of.
L63859	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who?
L63858	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Was she pretty?
L63857	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pretty terrible shot.
L63856	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	You.  Like the papers all say.
L63855	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who were you really trying to kill last night?
L63854	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Go away.  Let me rot?
L63853	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
L63852	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
L63810	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody okay up here?
L63809	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
L63808	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
L63807	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
L63805	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
L63804	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	He offered you money?
L63803	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
L63802	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
L63801	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
L63800	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	"Did you say...""Peggy""?"
L63799	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
L63798	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
L63797	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	This is so embarrassing...
L63796	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Raise your hand...where?
L64216	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
L64215	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
L64214	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	A what?
L64213	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
L64198	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
L64197	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
L64196	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
L64195	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
L64194	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
L64359	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	Damn John Whorfin--!
L64358	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	But John Whorfin said kill her.
L64072	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	You look!  It's not here!
L64071	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	John Whorfin will kill us!
L64070	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	Not here!  No Overthruster!
L63940	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	I have a radio fix...
L63939	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
L63935	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
L63934	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
L64256	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Should we be on Code Red?
L64255	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
L64254	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
L64253	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
L64252	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	What's happening with my call to SAC?
L64251	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	No, sir.  I think the flint...
L64250	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
L64008	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Better than him.
L64007	u3862	m255	RENO	Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
L64006	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What's his problem?
L63956	u3862	m255	RENO	Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
L63955	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
L63954	u3862	m255	RENO	Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
L63953	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
L63952	u3862	m255	RENO	Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
L63951	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
L64275	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Asshole probably got lost.
L64274	u3862	m255	RENO	We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
L63928	u3862	m255	RENO	No!  Ditto the professor-
L63927	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Any sign of Buckaroo?
L63850	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
L63849	u3862	m255	RENO	Why me?
L63848	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
L63844	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Where do you hail from, Doc?
L63843	u3862	m255	RENO	The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
L63827	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
L63826	u3862	m255	RENO	You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
L63825	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
L63821	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
L63820	u3862	m255	RENO	Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
L63819	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Pictures don't lie.
L63818	u3862	m255	RENO	Doesn't look anything like her to me.
L63817	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's a spittin' image.
L63816	u3862	m255	RENO	I didn't drop 'em.
L63815	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Pick those up, Reno.
L63680	u3862	m255	RENO	Why me?
L63679	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
L63719	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
L63718	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
L63693	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Bet I do.
L63692	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
L63691	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
L63690	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Flying to Cambodia.
L63689	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
L63688	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
L63687	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	So where's Buckaroo?
L73169	u3920	m260	BARBARA	The boys need help.
L73168	u3919	m260	ALFRED	In spirit only, I'm afraid.
L73167	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Uncle Alfred?
L73103	u3919	m260	ALFRED	It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
L73102	u3920	m260	BARBARA	What is it?
L73101	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
L73099	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
L73098	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
L73097	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Too late for what, dear child?
L73096	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm sorry.  I was too late.
L72785	u3919	m260	ALFRED	As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
L72784	u3920	m260	BARBARA	It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
L72783	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
L72782	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
L72781	u3919	m260	ALFRED	You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
L72780	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
L72765	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Oh no, those things frighten me.
L72764	u3919	m260	ALFRED	You certainly will not.
L72753	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Eventually she married a young physician.
L72752	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
L72751	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
L72748	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
L72747	u3920	m260	BARBARA	How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
L73298	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
L73297	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, are you...?
L73147	u3919	m260	ALFRED	It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
L73146	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What is it?
L73143	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
L73142	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
L73141	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Pheromones?
L73140	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
L73138	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Coming on line now, sir.
L73137	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
L73136	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Specify, please.
L73135	u3923	m260	BRUCE	First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
L73134	u3919	m260	ALFRED	That, sir, does not compute.
L73133	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Women.
L73132	u3919	m260	ALFRED	What seems to be the problem?
L73131	u3923	m260	BRUCE	It's good to see you.
L73129	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Right here, sir.
L73128	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
L73083	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
L73082	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I love you, old man.
L73081	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
L73080	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
L73005	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Yes?
L73004	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
L73003	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Not all heroes wear masks.
L73002	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
L73001	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
L73000	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
L72999	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
L72998	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I am as well as can be expected.
L72899	u3919	m260	ALFRED	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
L72898	u3923	m260	BRUCE	But I can't can I?
L72897	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
L72896	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
L72895	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Is there something wrong, sir?
L72894	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Thanks.
L72893	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
L72771	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
L72770	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
L72767	u3919	m260	ALFRED	There's a lovely inn just down --
L72766	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
L72757	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
L72756	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You have?
L72740	u3923	m260	BRUCE	No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
L72739	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
L72697	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
L72696	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
L72695	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
L72694	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
L73303	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You are going back to school.
L73302	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
L73301	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
L72761	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I recognized the accent.
L72760	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
L72759	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Oxbridge Academy?
L72758	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm on break from-
L72963	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
L72962	u3924	m260	DICK	Alfred's happy here.
L72961	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
L72960	u3924	m260	DICK	Alfred and Bruce are like family.
L72959	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
L72958	u3924	m260	DICK	What are you talking about?
L72957	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
L72956	u3924	m260	DICK	Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
L72955	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
L72954	u3924	m260	DICK	You'd be surprised.
L72953	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
L72951	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
L72950	u3924	m260	DICK	Hey, what's your problem?
L72949	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
L72948	u3924	m260	DICK	Keep it.
L72947	u3920	m260	BARBARA	This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
L72946	u3924	m260	DICK	Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
L72945	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
L72755	u3920	m260	BARBARA	My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
L72754	u3924	m260	DICK	Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
L72743	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
L72742	u3924	m260	DICK	Please be looking for me.
L73250	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
L73249	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Damn?  Damn is not good.
L73248	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
L73237	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	I don't know.  It just feels right.
L73236	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What exactly are you doing?
L73235	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Pow!  What!  Kazow!
L73234	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Be ready for anything.
L73233	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	I'm afraid to ask.
L73232	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number two.
L73228	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Why?
L73227	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
L73226	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	This is easy.
L73223	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
L73222	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
L73215	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Divide and conquer.
L73214	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
L73285	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I didn't kill your wife.
L73284	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
L73269	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
L73268	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You're loosing your cool
L73225	u3922	m260	BATMAN	We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
L73224	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
L72627	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
L72626	u3925	m260	FREEZE	After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
L72623	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I hate being lectured.
L72622	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
L73278	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
L73277	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Winded, old timer?
L73247	u3930	m260	ROBIN	From the other side of the equator-
L73246	u3922	m260	BATMAN	If we could relay the sunlight-
L73239	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Maybe he melted.
L73238	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No sign of the snowman.
L73206	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
L73205	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I guess we'll just have to kill her.
L73204	u3922	m260	BATMAN	She knows who we are.
L73203	u3930	m260	ROBIN	We gotta get those locks changed.
L73055	u3930	m260	ROBIN	A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
L73054	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
L73053	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What are you talking about?
L73052	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
L73031	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Just the beast.
L73030	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No beauty...
L73029	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
L73028	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Can he save her?
L73027	u3922	m260	BATMAN	She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
L73026	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Open Sesame...Chicken.
L73025	u3930	m260	ROBIN	How did you...?
L73024	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Definitely.
L73023	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Umm-hmmmm.
L73022	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Me too.  Great stems, though.
L73021	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I'm totally over her.  Positively.
L73020	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
L73019	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
L73018	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I know.  The feeling just vanished.
L73017	u3930	m260	ROBIN	She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
L72878	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I can make it.
L72877	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
L72857	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
L72856	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You don't have two million.  Three million - -
L72834	u3922	m260	BATMAN	He'll be here.
L72833	u3930	m260	ROBIN	You think Freeze will take the bait?
L72637	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Surf's up.
L72636	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Watch the first step.
L72631	u3930	m260	ROBIN	How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
L72630	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
L72629	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I was just hanging around.
L72594	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
L72593	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
L72592	u3922	m260	BATMAN	The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
L72591	u3930	m260	ROBIN	The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
L72590	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Mr. Freeze.
L72589	u3930	m260	ROBIN	... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
L72584	u3930	m260	ROBIN	It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
L72583	u3922	m260	BATMAN	This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
L72582	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
L72581	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Nice suit.  And today you are?
L73120	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
L73119	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
L73118	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
L72827	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
L72826	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
L72820	u3923	m260	BRUCE	People come first, Dr. Isley.
L72819	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
L72818	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
L72817	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
L72816	u3929	m260	PAMELA	I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
L72815	u3923	m260	BRUCE	That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
L72814	u3929	m260	PAMELA	I see you knew him.
L72813	u3923	m260	BRUCE	We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
L72812	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
L72811	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
L72810	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Dr. Pamela Isley.
L72809	u3923	m260	BRUCE	They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
L73117	u3927	m260	JULIE	You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
L73116	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Well...um...her.
L73115	u3927	m260	JULIE	Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
L73111	u3927	m260	JULIE	Bruce?  What are you doing?
L73110	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
L72932	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I wish I knew.
L72931	u3927	m260	JULIE	You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
L72930	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What?
L72929	u3927	m260	JULIE	Who's Ivy?
L72928	u3927	m260	JULIE	I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
L72927	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I wouldn't bet on that.
L72926	u3927	m260	JULIE	But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
L72925	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
L72924	u3927	m260	JULIE	I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
L72923	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
L72922	u3927	m260	JULIE	We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
L72921	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
L72920	u3927	m260	JULIE	You're not even listening to me.
L72803	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Can I get some help over here?
L72802	u3927	m260	JULIE	And?
L72799	u3927	m260	JULIE	But soon...
L72798	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
L72797	u3927	m260	JULIE	No!?
L73300	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I knew you could handle it.
L73299	u3924	m260	DICK	One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
L73159	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
L73158	u3924	m260	DICK	You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
L73157	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She wants to kill you.
L73156	u3924	m260	DICK	Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
L73155	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
L73154	u3924	m260	DICK	And she did it all for me.  For love.
L73153	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
L73152	u3924	m260	DICK	That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
L73094	u3924	m260	DICK	Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
L73093	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
L73092	u3924	m260	DICK	Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
L73091	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
L73090	u3924	m260	DICK	Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
L73089	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dick, don't push me right now.
L73088	u3924	m260	DICK	Like hell you do.
L73087	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
L73086	u3924	m260	DICK	I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
L73085	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
L73084	u3924	m260	DICK	McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
L72970	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
L72969	u3924	m260	DICK	Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
L72968	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
L72967	u3924	m260	DICK	But he's never said a word-
L72966	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
L72750	u3924	m260	DICK	Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
L72749	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
L72733	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
L72732	u3924	m260	DICK	I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
L72691	u3924	m260	DICK	I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
L72690	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
L72689	u3924	m260	DICK	Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
L72688	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
L72687	u3924	m260	DICK	We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
L72686	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I need the Wayne Diamonds.
L72683	u3924	m260	DICK	Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
L72682	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
L72681	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Presumed dead.  No one knows.
L72680	u3924	m260	DICK	What happened to his wife?
L72679	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
L72678	u3924	m260	DICK	That's gotta hurt.
L73296	u3926	m260	IVY	Not good.
L73295	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
L73078	u3926	m260	IVY	I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
L73077	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
L73076	u3926	m260	IVY	The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
L73075	u3925	m260	FREEZE	One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
L73074	u3926	m260	IVY	As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
L73073	u3925	m260	FREEZE	That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
L73072	u3926	m260	IVY	Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
L73071	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
L73070	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Adam and Evil.
L73069	u3926	m260	IVY	I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
L73068	u3926	m260	IVY	Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
L73067	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
L73066	u3926	m260	IVY	Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
L73065	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
L73063	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You lie!
L73062	u3926	m260	IVY	There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
L73061	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Where is my wife?
L73060	u3926	m260	IVY	Make yourself right at home.
L73015	u3926	m260	IVY	OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
L73014	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You will rescue my wife
L73013	u3926	m260	IVY	Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
L73012	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
L73011	u3926	m260	IVY	Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
L73010	u3926	m260	IVY	You leave Batman and Robin to me.
L73009	u3925	m260	FREEZE	In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
L73008	u3926	m260	IVY	You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
L73007	u3925	m260	FREEZE	My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
L72993	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Dear daisy, don't despair.
L72992	u3926	m260	IVY	I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
L72991	u3925	m260	FREEZE	No gun.  How disarming.
L72988	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
L72987	u3926	m260	IVY	I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
L72985	u3926	m260	IVY	Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
L72984	u3925	m260	FREEZE	An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
L72983	u3926	m260	IVY	Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
L72982	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Impressive
L72868	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
L72867	u3926	m260	IVY	Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
L72866	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
L72718	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
L72717	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
L72716	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
L72715	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	What say we turn up the heat?
L72714	u3925	m260	FREEZE	To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
L72713	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
L72712	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I find that unlikely.
L72711	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
L73191	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
L73190	u3926	m260	IVY	You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
L73188	u3926	m260	IVY	Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
L73187	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Then you never loved me?
L73186	u3926	m260	IVY	You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
L73185	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What do you mean?
L73184	u3926	m260	IVY	Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
L73183	u3926	m260	IVY	One kiss, my love.  For luck.
L73182	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I've got to stop him.
L73181	u3926	m260	IVY	Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
L73180	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Tell me and I'll kiss you.
L73179	u3926	m260	IVY	Kiss me and I'll tell you.
L73178	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Of trust. Tell me your plan.
L73177	u3926	m260	IVY	How about dangerous curves?
L73176	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
L73175	u3926	m260	IVY	I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
L73039	u3926	m260	IVY	At you?  Polly want a kiss?
L73038	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
L72706	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
L72705	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
L72671	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Well, I can respect your opinion.
L72670	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
L72669	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
L72668	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Our work?
L72667	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
L72655	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
L72654	u3929	m260	PAMELA	You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
L72651	u3929	m260	PAMELA	What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
L72650	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
L111291	u4249	m283	SAM	What have you done to my flat?
L111290	u4233	m283	DOWSER	... And then some.
L110862	u4249	m283	SAM	I fixed it myself.
L110861	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...your ducts?
L110847	u4249	m283	SAM	I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
L110846	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...ergency procedures.
L110743	u4249	m283	SAM	Thank you.
L110742	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...Be back.

L111302	u4233	m283	DOWSER	... new washer.
L111301	u4251	m283	SPOOR	I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
L111300	u4233	m283	DOWSER	... yer ducts.
L111299	u4251	m283	SPOOR	This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.

L110871	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...sod you, stupid twit.
L110870	u4251	m283	SPOOR	You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
L110869	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...ven't you?
L110866	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...sabotage!
L110865	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
L110864	u4233	m283	DOWSER	...Yer nostril?
L110863	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?

L110854	u4233	m283	DOWSER	Got there!
L110853	u4251	m283	SPOOR	What have you got there?

L110715	u4251	m283	SPOOR	You telephone, sir.
L110678	u4234	m283	GENT	You must save the day.
L110677	u4249	m283	SAM	What do I have to do.
L110676	u4234	m283	GENT	Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
L110675	u4249	m283	SAM	What? You mean you've got ...
L110674	u4234	m283	GENT	Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
L110673	u4234	m283	GENT	We know that too. You've come to the right place.
L110672	u4249	m283	SAM	Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
L110671	u4234	m283	GENT	We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
L110670	u4249	m283	SAM	What? How do you know my name?
L110669	u4234	m283	GENT	Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
L110881	u4235	m283	GIRL	Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
L110880	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
L110879	u4235	m283	GIRL	Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
L110878	u4249	m283	SAM	Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
L110877	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh, right ...
L110876	u4235	m283	GIRL	You don't have to sing it.
L110875	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
L110874	u4235	m283	GIRL	It's reply paid.
L110873	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... Thanks ...
L110822	u4249	m283	SAM	He will be pleased when he comes home.
L110821	u4236	m283	GIRL BUTTLE	I'm waiting for my daddy.
L110820	u4249	m283	SAM	Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
L110819	u4236	m283	GIRL BUTTLE	Layton.
L110818	u4249	m283	SAM	What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
L110817	u4236	m283	GIRL BUTTLE	Her name is Jill.
L110816	u4249	m283	SAM	Go away.
L110508	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
L110507	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
L110506	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Beginner's luck.
L110505	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
L110504	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
L110503	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
L110501	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
L110500	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
L110499	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
L110498	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
L110497	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
L110496	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	In fact, killing people -
L110495	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
L110494	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
L111382	u4249	m283	SAM	No, no ... I did that...
L111381	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
L111379	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
L111378	u4249	m283	SAM	Please, I've got to find Jill.
L111377	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
L111376	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
L111375	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
L111374	u4249	m283	SAM	This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
L111373	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
L111372	u4249	m283	SAM	Help me!
L111371	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
L111370	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
L111369	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Gillian Layton?
L111368	u4249	m283	SAM	Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
L111367	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
L110942	u4249	m283	SAM	Well ... well, I ...
L110941	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Too late? That's for me to say.
L110940	u4249	m283	SAM	Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
L110939	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
L110937	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
L110936	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry ...
L110935	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, I ...
L110934	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	If I can help you ...
L110933	u4249	m283	SAM	That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
L110932	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Thanks very much Sam.
L111399	u4239	m283	JACK	Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
L111398	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack ...
L111397	u4239	m283	JACK	How do you think I feel? You shit!
L111396	u4249	m283	SAM	Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
L111395	u4239	m283	JACK	How could you do this to me?
L111394	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L111393	u4239	m283	JACK	You stupid bastard!
L111392	u4249	m283	SAM	This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
L111391	u4239	m283	JACK	Bastard!!!
L111390	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
L111389	u4239	m283	JACK	Shut up!
L111388	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack?... Jack?
L111275	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
L111274	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes we have, Jack!
L111273	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
L111272	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack, she's innocent!
L111271	u4239	m283	JACK	There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
L111270	u4249	m283	SAM	It could all be coincidental.
L111269	u4239	m283	JACK	I do. Goodbye. 
L111268	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
L111267	u4239	m283	JACK	Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
L111266	u4249	m283	SAM	She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
L111265	u4239	m283	JACK	I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
L111264	u4249	m283	SAM	Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
L111087	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
L111086	u4249	m283	SAM	Trust me.
L111085	u4239	m283	JACK	Do you know what you're doing.
L111084	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
L111083	u4239	m283	JACK	Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
L111082	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
L111081	u4239	m283	JACK	We don't make mistakes.
L111080	u4249	m283	SAM	Say it was a mistake.
L111079	u4239	m283	JACK	There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
L111078	u4249	m283	SAM	Take her off the list.
L111077	u4239	m283	JACK	But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
L111076	u4249	m283	SAM	They weren't at school with us.
L111075	u4239	m283	JACK	Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
L111074	u4249	m283	SAM	Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
L111073	u4239	m283	JACK	You're the only person I can trust.
L111072	u4249	m283	SAM	And you're mine.
L111071	u4239	m283	JACK	Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
L111070	u4249	m283	SAM	Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
L111069	u4239	m283	JACK	What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
L111068	u4249	m283	SAM	Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
L111067	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
L111066	u4249	m283	SAM	You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
L111065	u4239	m283	JACK	Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
L111064	u4249	m283	SAM	So what are you going to do about her?
L111063	u4239	m283	JACK	Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
L111062	u4249	m283	SAM	Out of kindness.
L111061	u4239	m283	JACK	{baffled) I don't follow you.
L111060	u4249	m283	SAM	Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
L111059	u4239	m283	JACK	Why?
L111058	u4249	m283	SAM	Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
L111057	u4239	m283	JACK	Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
L111056	u4249	m283	SAM	Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
L111055	u4239	m283	JACK	Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
L111054	u4249	m283	SAM	But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
L111052	u4249	m283	SAM	A terrorist?
L111051	u4239	m283	JACK	She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
L111050	u4249	m283	SAM	Tell me about Layton.
L111049	u4239	m283	JACK	Yes. I'm impressed.
L111048	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
L111047	u4239	m283	JACK	Very smart.
L111046	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... no.
L111045	u4239	m283	JACK	You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
L111044	u4249	m283	SAM	What's she done?
L111043	u4239	m283	JACK	He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
L111042	u4249	m283	SAM	He's a freelance subversive?
L111041	u4239	m283	JACK	We suspect him of freelance subversion.
L111040	u4249	m283	SAM	What has Tuttle done?
L111039	u4239	m283	JACK	What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
L111038	u4249	m283	SAM	So how ...?
L111037	u4239	m283	JACK	There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
L111036	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sure you have
L111035	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
L111034	u4249	m283	SAM	You killed him?
L111033	u4239	m283	JACK	I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
L111032	u4249	m283	SAM	You got the wrong man.
L111031	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
L111030	u4249	m283	SAM	No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
L111029	u4239	m283	JACK	Christ! You do know it all!
L111028	u4249	m283	SAM	B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
L111027	u4239	m283	JACK	OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
L111026	u4249	m283	SAM	Not really, no.
L111025	u4239	m283	JACK	Enough though, eh?
L111024	u4249	m283	SAM	Not much.
L111023	u4239	m283	JACK	How much do you know?
L111022	u4249	m283	SAM	How do you mean?
L111021	u4239	m283	JACK	Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
L111020	u4249	m283	SAM	Am I?
L111019	u4239	m283	JACK	You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
L111018	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L111017	u4239	m283	JACK	Layton! Oh shit!
L111016	u4249	m283	SAM	I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
L111015	u4239	m283	JACK	OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
L111014	u4249	m283	SAM	I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
L111013	u4239	m283	JACK	What?
L111012	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ...
L111011	u4239	m283	JACK	Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
L111010	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, thanks.
L111009	u4239	m283	JACK	For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
L111008	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
L111007	u4239	m283	JACK	Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
L111006	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you officer 412/L?
L111005	u4239	m283	JACK	SAM! What a surprise!
L111004	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack!!
L110925	u4239	m283	JACK	Mr Helpmann!
L110924	u4249	m283	SAM	Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
L110923	u4239	m283	JACK	Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
L110920	u4249	m283	SAM	What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
L110919	u4239	m283	JACK	Remember how they used to stick out?
L110918	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, I knew you looked different.
L110917	u4239	m283	JACK	{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
L110913	u4239	m283	JACK	You remember Alison?
L110912	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello, Jack!
L110551	u4249	m283	SAM	Really? - God, how time flies!
L110550	u4239	m283	JACK	Triplets.
L110549	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
L110548	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
L110547	u4249	m283	SAM	Even later.
L110546	u4239	m283	JACK	You are late.
L110545	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
L110544	u4239	m283	JACK	What's the matter?
L110543	u4239	m283	JACK	Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
L110542	u4249	m283	SAM	You sound worried.
L110541	u4239	m283	JACK	Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
L110540	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
L110539	u4239	m283	JACK	Long time no see!
L110538	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack!
L110537	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam!
L111104	u4240	m283	JILL	Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
L111103	u4248	m283	PORTER	Oh.
L111102	u4240	m283	JILL	I bet you'd like to touch them?
L111101	u4248	m283	PORTER	Ah.
L111100	u4240	m283	JILL	You think these are tits don't you?
L111099	u4248	m283	PORTER	If you say so.
L111098	u4240	m283	JILL	You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
L111089	u4248	m283	PORTER	You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
L111088	u4240	m283	JILL	But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
L110561	u4248	m283	PORTER	Information Adjustments.
L110560	u4240	m283	JILL	Where do I get it stamped?
L110559	u4248	m283	PORTER	No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
L110558	u4240	m283	JILL	Stamped?
L110557	u4248	m283	PORTER	Is it stamped?
L110556	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L110555	u4248	m283	PORTER	Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
L110554	u4240	m283	JILL	I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
L110553	u4248	m283	PORTER	You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
L110552	u4240	m283	JILL	I want to report a wrongful arrest.
L111336	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
L111335	u4240	m283	JILL	What do you think? ... is it me?
L111323	u4240	m283	JILL	Take care.
L111322	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L111321	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't do anything silly.
L111320	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
L111319	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you going?
L111318	u4249	m283	SAM	Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
L111306	u4249	m283	SAM	C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
L111305	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't you like parties?
L111286	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L111285	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you sure?
L111284	u4240	m283	JILL	They're gone.
L111283	u4249	m283	SAM	No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
L111282	u4240	m283	JILL	Your face ... are you hurt?
L111281	u4249	m283	SAM	What happened to you after ...
L111280	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L111279	u4249	m283	SAM	Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
L111226	u4240	m283	JILL	No you're not!
L111225	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm going to open it!
L111224	u4240	m283	JILL	Oh ... Jesus!
L111223	u4249	m283	SAM	........... It's a bomb isn't it?
L111222	u4240	m283	JILL	I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
L111221	u4249	m283	SAM	I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
L111220	u4240	m283	JILL	You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
L111219	u4249	m283	SAM	You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
L111218	u4240	m283	JILL	Leave me alone!
L111217	u4249	m283	SAM	There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
L111216	u4240	m283	JILL	Go away.
L111215	u4249	m283	SAM	Please, Jill ... I love you.
L111214	u4240	m283	JILL	Are you still following me?
L111213	u4249	m283	SAM	This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
L111211	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
L111210	u4249	m283	SAM	Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
L111209	u4240	m283	JILL	What?
L111208	u4249	m283	SAM	And your children all gone.
L111207	u4240	m283	JILL	Shit! The house is on fire!
L111206	u4249	m283	SAM	It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
L111205	u4240	m283	JILL	We? Don't blame me!
L111204	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh God! What have we done?
L111203	u4240	m283	JILL	Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
L111201	u4240	m283	JILL	Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
L111200	u4249	m283	SAM	Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
L111199	u4240	m283	JILL	Let go! We've got to stop!
L111198	u4249	m283	SAM	I was right! Step on it!
L111196	u4240	m283	JILL	Stop it ... damn you!
L111195	u4249	m283	SAM	Turn!
L111194	u4240	m283	JILL	Get away!
L111193	u4249	m283	SAM	Will you please turn back.
L111192	u4240	m283	JILL	Cut it out, Sam.
L111191	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
L111190	u4240	m283	JILL	I thought you arrested me.
L111189	u4249	m283	SAM	No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
L111188	u4240	m283	JILL	You're joking.
L111187	u4249	m283	SAM	Security.
L111186	u4240	m283	JILL	Who will?
L111185	u4249	m283	SAM	They'll be there waiting.
L111184	u4240	m283	JILL	What?
L111183	u4249	m283	SAM	Turn around!
L111182	u4249	m283	SAM	Every day?
L111181	u4240	m283	JILL	Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
L111180	u4249	m283	SAM	What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
L111179	u4240	m283	JILL	Look at that - right on time.
L111178	u4249	m283	SAM	Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
L111177	u4240	m283	JILL	How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
L111176	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, terrorists of course.
L111175	u4240	m283	JILL	Who is this war against, Sam?
L111174	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, all wars do -
L111173	u4240	m283	JILL	Say, all wars have innocent victims.
L111172	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, no system is.
L111171	u4240	m283	JILL	Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
L111170	u4240	m283	JILL	They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
L111169	u4249	m283	SAM	Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
L111168	u4240	m283	JILL	We've got both.
L111167	u4249	m283	SAM	What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
L111166	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
L111165	u4249	m283	SAM	Suit me?
L111164	u4240	m283	JILL	I mean, it doesn't suit you.
L111163	u4249	m283	SAM	Really.
L111162	u4240	m283	JILL	No, really.
L111161	u4249	m283	SAM	Looking for you.
L111160	u4240	m283	JILL	What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
L111157	u4240	m283	JILL	A heavy Christmas present.
L111156	u4249	m283	SAM	It's heavy.
L111155	u4240	m283	JILL	What parcel?
L111154	u4249	m283	SAM	OK. What's in the parcel?
L111153	u4240	m283	JILL	What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
L111152	u4249	m283	SAM	What's going on here?
L111150	u4249	m283	SAM	Where are you taking me?
L111149	u4240	m283	JILL	It does doesn't it?
L111148	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
L111147	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you taking me?
L111146	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L111145	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you taking me?
L111144	u4240	m283	JILL	It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
L111143	u4249	m283	SAM	Why not?
L111142	u4240	m283	JILL	I didn't like it.
L111141	u4249	m283	SAM	Why?
L111140	u4240	m283	JILL	I didn't run away. I left the flat.
L111139	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
L111138	u4240	m283	JILL	I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
L111137	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, of course. Sorry.
L111136	u4240	m283	JILL	It's my fucking life.
L111135	u4249	m283	SAM	You know, smoking's bad for you.
L111134	u4249	m283	SAM	I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
L111133	u4240	m283	JILL	Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
L111132	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
L111131	u4240	m283	JILL	I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
L111130	u4249	m283	SAM	... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
L111129	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh, sorry.
L111128	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't litter my cab!
L111127	u4249	m283	SAM	Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
L111126	u4240	m283	JILL	Them?
L111125	u4249	m283	SAM	Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
L111124	u4249	m283	SAM	Please!
L111123	u4240	m283	JILL	No.
L111122	u4249	m283	SAM	Bloody hell! Do as I say!
L111120	u4240	m283	JILL	Who are you?
L111119	u4249	m283	SAM	What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
L111113	u4240	m283	JILL	Good!
L111112	u4249	m283	SAM	Ow! That hurt!
L111111	u4240	m283	JILL	How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
L111110	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't look back! Act naturally!
L111109	u4240	m283	JILL	Who are you? Let go!
L110812	u4240	m283	JILL	Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
L110811	u4249	m283	SAM	It's you ... it's you ...
L110810	u4240	m283	JILL	Are you alright?
L110842	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
L110841	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	It's what you wanted isn't it?
L110840	u4249	m283	SAM	What! Shit!
L110839	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I did it for you.
L110838	u4249	m283	SAM	I never signed the form.
L110837	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
L110836	u4249	m283	SAM	I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
L110835	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
L110834	u4249	m283	SAM	I know that.
L110833	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
L110832	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
L110831	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What's the matter?
L110830	u4249	m283	SAM	Damn! Blast!
L110828	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes.
L110827	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Can I forget it?
L110826	u4249	m283	SAM	I delivered it.
L110825	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
L110790	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't mention it. See you later.
L110789	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	You are good to me Sam.
L110788	u4249	m283	SAM	That's it.
L110787	u4249	m283	SAM	Here.
L110786	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
L110785	u4249	m283	SAM	Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
L110784	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
L110783	u4249	m283	SAM	Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
L110782	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Here. What do I do next?
L110779	u4249	m283	SAM	Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
L110778	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What?
L110777	u4249	m283	SAM	You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
L110776	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
L110775	u4249	m283	SAM	Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
L110772	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	27156789/074328/K.
L110771	u4249	m283	SAM	There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
L110770	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Next of kin!
L110769	u4249	m283	SAM	Try next of kin.
L110768	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
L110767	u4249	m283	SAM	He is dead.
L110766	u4249	m283	SAM	Hang on.
L110765	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
L110764	u4249	m283	SAM	Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
L110763	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
L110762	u4249	m283	SAM	I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
L110761	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
L110760	u4249	m283	SAM	Tuttle?
L110759	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	The refund for Tuttle!
L110758	u4249	m283	SAM	A cheque.
L110578	u4249	m283	SAM	What a BITCH!
L110577	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
L110576	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	You've been promoted.
L110575	u4249	m283	SAM	Really.
L110574	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Would you really, Sam?
L110573	u4249	m283	SAM	I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
L110572	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	But if they did promote you
L110571	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't worry.
L110570	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
L110569	u4249	m283	SAM	Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
L110568	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh, good!
L110567	u4249	m283	SAM	Information Retrieval.
L110566	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Isn't it? Whose is it?
L110565	u4249	m283	SAM	It's not our mistake!
L110564	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh my God, a mistake!
L110563	u4249	m283	SAM	It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have ?31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
L110562	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
L111261	u4242	m283	LIME	Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
L111260	u4249	m283	SAM	Lime, I need to use your computer
L110990	u4249	m283	SAM	Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
L110989	u4242	m283	LIME	Hey - that's my desk!
L110982	u4242	m283	LIME	Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
L110981	u4249	m283	SAM	You haven't switched it on.
L110980	u4242	m283	LIME	Sod it, it's broken!
L110979	u4242	m283	LIME	You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
L110978	u4249	m283	SAM	What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
L110977	u4242	m283	LIME	This is your dream girl, is it?
L110976	u4249	m283	SAM	I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
L110975	u4242	m283	LIME	A woman eh? I see.
L110974	u4249	m283	SAM	Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
L110973	u4242	m283	LIME	I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
L110972	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes.
L110971	u4242	m283	LIME	You want to take my console into your office?
L110970	u4249	m283	SAM	I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
L110969	u4242	m283	LIME	What?
L110968	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
L110967	u4242	m283	LIME	Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
L110966	u4249	m283	SAM	Sam Lowry.
L110965	u4242	m283	LIME	No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
L111314	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
L111313	u4249	m283	SAM	How long will she he away?
L111312	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	I won't be held responsible.
L111311	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, she's my mother, not yours.
L111310	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	She didn't say anything about it to me.
L111309	u4249	m283	SAM	My mother said it would be all right.
L110633	u4244	m283	MOTHER	I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
L110632	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero une, crevettes ? la mayonaaise. 
L110619	u4250	m283	SPIRO	A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
L110618	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
L110604	u4244	m283	MOTHER	We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
L110603	u4250	m283	SPIRO	{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
L110602	u4244	m283	MOTHER	You remember Samuel, my son.
L110601	u4250	m283	SPIRO	I'm sorry but ...
L110600	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
L111411	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Not now ... please
L111410	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
L111409	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Sam!!! 
L110889	u4249	m283	SAM	Actually, I've decided ...
L110888	u4244	m283	MOTHER	It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
L110887	u4249	m283	SAM	I want to talk to him.
L110886	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
L110885	u4249	m283	SAM	Is Mr Helpmann here?
L110884	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
L110883	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother? Is that you?
L110659	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
L110658	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
L110657	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
L110650	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother!
L110649	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
L110641	u4244	m283	MOTHER	By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
L110640	u4249	m283	SAM	This isn't rare!
L110639	u4244	m283	MOTHER	What were we saying?
L110598	u4244	m283	MOTHER	It's something for executives.
L110597	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L110596	u4244	m283	MOTHER	I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
L110594	u4249	m283	SAM	You're not listening, mother.
L110593	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
L110581	u4244	m283	MOTHER	No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
L110580	u4249	m283	SAM	I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
L110809	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
L110808	u4249	m283	SAM	Uh ...
L110806	u4249	m283	SAM	Um ...
L110805	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	What have you done with his body?
L110804	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
L110803	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	My husband's dead, isn't he?
L110802	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
L110801	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	Mistake?
L110800	u4249	m283	SAM	It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
L111233	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
L111232	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, yes ...
L111231	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
L111230	u4249	m283	SAM	I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
L111229	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
L110908	u4249	m283	SAM	I ... uh ...
L110907	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
L110906	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	I know, I know ...!
L110905	u4249	m283	SAM	Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
L110904	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
L110903	u4249	m283	SAM	Whatever happened to you?
L110648	u4249	m283	SAM	What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
L110647	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
L110635	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
L110634	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
L110629	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
L110628	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
L110627	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
L110615	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
L110614	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
L110613	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
L110686	u4249	m283	SAM	What? Who is this?
L110685	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Put the phone down and your hands up.
L110684	u4249	m283	SAM	Who's that? 
L110683	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Hello. Mr Lowry?
L110682	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello ... hello ...

L110663	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
L111328	u4249	m283	SAM	Thank you, Dawson.
L111327	u4248	m283	PORTER	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
L111326	u4249	m283	SAM	And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
L111325	u4248	m283	PORTER	I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
L111324	u4249	m283	SAM	Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
L110951	u4248	m283	PORTER	No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
L110950	u4249	m283	SAM	But I could be anybody.

L110948	u4249	m283	SAM	My I.D. cards.
L110947	u4248	m283	PORTER	No, sir.
L110946	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, don't you want to search me?
L110945	u4248	m283	PORTER	Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.

L111295	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's a 27B/6 of course.
L111294	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L111289	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Thermostat's gone. And then some.
L111288	u4249	m283	SAM	For God's sake, what's happened?
L110868	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
L110867	u4249	m283	SAM	Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
L110860	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Who fixed your ducts?
L110859	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L110850	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
L110849	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L110848	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Sign here please.
L110845	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Emergency procedures.
L110844	u4249	m283	SAM	What the - ? How did you - ?
L110741	u4251	m283	SPOOR	We'll be back.
L110740	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
L110739	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
L110738	u4251	m283	SPOOR	But we can get one.
L110737	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Not ... as such ...
L110736	u4249	m283	SAM	Have you got one or haven't you?
L110735	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Now look what you've done to him.
L110723	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Fixed itself.
L110722	u4249	m283	SAM	I mean it fixed itself.
L110720	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Fixed?
L110719	u4249	m283	SAM	No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
L110712	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Central Services.
L110711	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes?
L110750	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
L110749	u4249	m283	SAM	Thank you very much. How much will it...?
L110748	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Time to go.
L110747	u4249	m283	SAM	What do they want you or?
L110746	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
L110745	u4249	m283	SAM	Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
L110710	u4249	m283	SAM	No. Wait here.
L110709	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Are you expecting anyone?
L110707	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	No. But I can bypass it with one of these
L110706	u4249	m283	SAM	Can you fix it?
L110705	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
L110704	u4249	m283	SAM	Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
L110703	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
L110702	u4249	m283	SAM	The pace?
L110701	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
L110700	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
L110699	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
L110698	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
L110697	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you saying this is illegal?
L110696	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
L110694	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L110693	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
L110692	u4249	m283	SAM	But ... I called Central Services.
L110691	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Ha!!
L110690	u4249	m283	SAM	Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
L110689	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
L110688	u4249	m283	SAM	What is this?  Who the hell are you?
L110687	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
L138191	u4560	m301	DIM	Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
L138190	u4555	m301	ALEX	I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
L138189	u4560	m301	DIM	Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
L138188	u4555	m301	ALEX	I've been cured.
L138187	u4560	m301	DIM	Been punished, yeah?
L138186	u4555	m301	ALEX	Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
L138185	u4560	m301	DIM	Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
L138182	u4555	m301	ALEX	Impossible... I don't believe it.
L138181	u4560	m301	DIM	Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
L137830	u4555	m301	ALEX	You bastards... bastards.
L137829	u4560	m301	DIM	One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
L137780	u4555	m301	ALEX	Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
L137779	u4560	m301	DIM	Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
L137776	u4555	m301	ALEX	Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
L137775	u4560	m301	DIM	He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
L137726	u4560	m301	DIM	Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
L137725	u4555	m301	ALEX	A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
L137724	u4560	m301	DIM	Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
L137723	u4555	m301	ALEX	Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
L137722	u4560	m301	DIM	I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
L137721	u4555	m301	ALEX	For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
L137720	u4560	m301	DIM	What did you do that for?
L137719	u4555	m301	ALEX	There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
L137718	u4560	m301	DIM	Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
L137717	u4560	m301	DIM	We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
L137716	u4560	m301	DIM	Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
L138249	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
L138248	u4555	m301	ALEX	Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
L138247	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
L138246	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
L138245	u4555	m301	ALEX	Who are they, sir?
L138244	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Help you.
L138243	u4555	m301	ALEX	Help me, sir?
L138242	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Yes. They want to help.
L138241	u4555	m301	ALEX	Phoned some friends, sir?
L138240	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
L138239	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
L138238	u4555	m301	ALEX	I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
L138237	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	No. She's dead!
L138236	u4555	m301	ALEX	Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
L138235	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
L138234	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	My wife... Alex freezes.
L138233	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you, sir.
L138232	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
L138227	u4555	m301	ALEX	And you, sir?
L138226	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	No, my health doesn't allow it.
L138225	u4555	m301	ALEX	Won't you join me, sir?
L138224	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
L138223	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Try the wine!
L138222	u4555	m301	ALEX	Great, sir. Great.
L138221	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Of course. Food alright?
L138220	u4555	m301	ALEX	It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
L138219	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Good evening.
L138218	u4555	m301	ALEX	Good evening, sir.
L138208	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
L138207	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
L138206	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
L138205	u4555	m301	ALEX	The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
L138204	u4570	m301	MR. ALEXANDER	Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
L137825	u4556	m301	CATLADY	Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
L137824	u4555	m301	ALEX	You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
L137823	u4556	m301	CATLADY	No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
L137822	u4555	m301	ALEX	Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
L137821	u4556	m301	CATLADY	Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
L137820	u4555	m301	ALEX	Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
L137819	u4556	m301	CATLADY	What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
L137818	u4555	m301	ALEX	Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
L137814	u4555	m301	ALEX	Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
L137813	u4556	m301	CATLADY	I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
L137812	u4555	m301	ALEX	But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
L137811	u4556	m301	CATLADY	I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
L137810	u4555	m301	ALEX	Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
L138273	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
L138272	u4561	m301	DOLIN	Well, shall we get down to it?
L138271	u4555	m301	ALEX	What would you like to know, sir?
L138270	u4561	m301	DOLIN	But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
L138269	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you very much, sir.
L138268	u4561	m301	DOLIN	Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
L138267	u4555	m301	ALEX	Fine, sir, fine.
L138266	u4561	m301	DOLIN	Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
L138265	u4555	m301	ALEX	Much better, thank you, sir.
L138264	u4561	m301	DOLIN	Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
L138263	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
L138262	u4561	m301	DOLIN	I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
L138261	u4555	m301	ALEX	Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
L138258	u4555	m301	ALEX	Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
L138257	u4561	m301	DOLIN	Hullo.
L138256	u4555	m301	ALEX	How do you do, sir?
L138255	u4561	m301	DOLIN	So this is the young man?
L138136	u4555	m301	ALEX	Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
L138135	u4565	m301	EM	Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
L138127	u4555	m301	ALEX	Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
L138126	u4565	m301	EM	Alex.
L138125	u4555	m301	ALEX	Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
L137738	u4555	m301	ALEX	Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
L137737	u4565	m301	EM	Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
L137736	u4555	m301	ALEX	I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
L137735	u4565	m301	EM	You've not been to school all week, son.
L137734	u4555	m301	ALEX	Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
L137733	u4565	m301	EM	It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
L137856	u4559	m301	DELTOID	It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
L137855	u4555	m301	ALEX	You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
L137854	u4559	m301	DELTOID	I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
L137853	u4555	m301	ALEX	Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
L137852	u4559	m301	DELTOID	You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
L137763	u4555	m301	ALEX	As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
L137762	u4559	m301	DELTOID	That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
L137761	u4555	m301	ALEX	Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
L137760	u4559	m301	DELTOID	What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
L137759	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
L137758	u4555	m301	ALEX	I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
L137757	u4559	m301	DELTOID	A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
L137756	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
L137755	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
L137754	u4555	m301	ALEX	Just a manner of speech, sir.
L137753	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
L137752	u4555	m301	ALEX	"To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid ""playfully"" grabs Alex's hair."
L137751	u4559	m301	DELTOID	No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
L137750	u4555	m301	ALEX	A cup of the old chai, sir?
L137749	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
L137748	u4555	m301	ALEX	A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
L137747	u4559	m301	DELTOID	Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
L138290	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
L138289	u4555	m301	ALEX	Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
L138288	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	Do you still feel suicidal?
L138287	u4555	m301	ALEX	Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
L138286	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	Do you feel that way now?
L138285	u4555	m301	ALEX	Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
L138284	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	I beg your pardon?
L138283	u4555	m301	ALEX	That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
L138282	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
L138281	u4555	m301	ALEX	That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
L138280	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
L138279	u4555	m301	ALEX	Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
L138278	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
L138277	u4555	m301	ALEX	And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
L138276	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	It's alright, thank you.
L138275	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
L138274	u4573	m301	RUBINSTEIN	The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
L137806	u4555	m301	ALEX	Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
L137805	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
L137804	u4555	m301	ALEX	Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
L137803	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Not tonight - not this nochy.
L137792	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
L137791	u4555	m301	ALEX	Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
L137790	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
L137789	u4555	m301	ALEX	And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
L137783	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
L137782	u4555	m301	ALEX	New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
L137781	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
L137778	u4555	m301	ALEX	Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
L137777	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
L138378	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
L138377	u4569	m301	MINISTER	One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
L138376	u4555	m301	ALEX	Surprise?
L138375	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
L138374	u4555	m301	ALEX	As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
L138373	u4569	m301	MINISTER	My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
L138372	u4555	m301	ALEX	Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
L138371	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
L138370	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, who can blame them, sir?
L138369	u4569	m301	MINISTER	We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
L138368	u4555	m301	ALEX	Helping you, sir?
L138367	u4569	m301	MINISTER	You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
L138366	u4555	m301	ALEX	What job and how much?
L138365	u4569	m301	MINISTER	We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
L138364	u4555	m301	ALEX	Where is he now, sir?
L138363	u4569	m301	MINISTER	I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
L138362	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you, sir.
L138361	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
L138360	u4555	m301	ALEX	I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
L138359	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
L138358	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
L138351	u4555	m301	ALEX	Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
L138350	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Good evening, my boy.
L138120	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
L138119	u4555	m301	ALEX	Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
L138118	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Good.
L138117	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir, I feel really great.
L138116	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Not feeling too bad now are you?
L138115	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
L138114	u4555	m301	ALEX	She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
L138008	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
L138007	u4555	m301	ALEX	Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
L138002	u4555	m301	ALEX	The accidental killing of a person, sir.
L138001	u4569	m301	MINISTER	What crime did you commit.
L138000	u4555	m301	ALEX	I did, sir.
L137999	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Who said that?
L138307	u4571	m301	PEE	There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
L138306	u4555	m301	ALEX	What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
L138161	u4571	m301	PEE	Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
L138160	u4555	m301	ALEX	What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
L138159	u4571	m301	PEE	Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
L138158	u4555	m301	ALEX	What about Basil? Where's my snake?
L138157	u4571	m301	PEE	Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
L138156	u4555	m301	ALEX	No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
L138146	u4555	m301	ALEX	How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
L138145	u4571	m301	PEE	Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
L138144	u4555	m301	ALEX	Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
L138143	u4571	m301	PEE	Oh, aye, aye.
L138142	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, still the same old place then, eh?
L138141	u4571	m301	PEE	Aye.
L138140	u4555	m301	ALEX	That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
L138134	u4571	m301	PEE	Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
L138133	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well - I'm back.
L138132	u4571	m301	PEE	Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
L138131	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, how are you then?
L138130	u4571	m301	PEE	Fine, fine.
L138129	u4555	m301	ALEX	Keeping fit then?
L138128	u4571	m301	PEE	Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
L138111	u4555	m301	ALEX	And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
L138110	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
L138109	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
L138108	u4555	m301	ALEX	Let me get up.
L138107	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	You wanna be sick?
L138106	u4555	m301	ALEX	I wanna be sick.
L138105	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	You're gonna be sick are you?
L138104	u4555	m301	ALEX	I'm gonna be sick.
L138103	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
L138102	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
L138101	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
L138100	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
L138099	u4555	m301	ALEX	Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
L138098	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
L138097	u4555	m301	ALEX	Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
L138096	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	What do I want?
L138095	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, brother. What d'you want?
L138094	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
L138093	u4555	m301	ALEX	Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
L138092	u4568	m301	LARDFACE	Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
L138027	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
L138026	u4555	m301	ALEX	The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
L137998	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
L137997	u4555	m301	ALEX	You're absolutely right, sir.
L137931	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir.
L137930	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Through there for a bath.
L137929	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137928	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Lice?
L137927	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137926	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Crabs?
L137925	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137921	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Right. The mothballs, Mister.
L137920	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137917	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137916	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Are you an Epileptic?
L137911	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137910	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
L137909	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137908	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Have you ever had any mental illness?
L137903	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137902	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
L137901	u4555	m301	ALEX	Blue eyes, yes, sir.
L137900	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Blue eyes?
L137899	u4555	m301	ALEX	Fair hair, sir.
L137898	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Brown hair, is it?
L137897	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
L137896	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Do you mean Church of England?
L137895	u4555	m301	ALEX	C of E, sir.
L137894	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Religion?
L137889	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137888	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
L137887	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
L137886	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
L137885	u4555	m301	ALEX	No, sir.
L137884	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	"One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, ""Timawrist"" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?"
L137883	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
L137882	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
L137881	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes sir.
L137880	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
L137879	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes, sir.
L137872	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.
L137871	u4555	m301	ALEX	Murder, sir.
L137870	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Crime?
L137869	u4555	m301	ALEX	Alexander de Large, sir.
L137868	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
L138078	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes!!!
L138077	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	You've heard Beethoven before?
L138076	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes!!!
L138075	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Are you referring to the background score?
L138069	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
L138068	u4555	m301	ALEX	I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
L138067	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
L138066	u4555	m301	ALEX	But it was horrible.
L138065	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
L138064	u4555	m301	ALEX	You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
L138063	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
L138053	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
L138052	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Something like that.
L138051	u4555	m301	ALEX	You mean like going to the pictures?
L138050	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
L138049	u4555	m301	ALEX	What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
L138048	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
L138047	u4555	m301	ALEX	Vitamins will it be then?
L138046	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Oh no, nothing of the sort.
L138045	u4555	m301	ALEX	What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
L138044	u4555	m301	ALEX	I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
L138043	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	We're going to friends now, sir.
L138042	u4555	m301	ALEX	I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
L138041	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
L138040	u4555	m301	ALEX	Fine... fine.
L138039	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	How're you feeling this morning?
L138038	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
L138037	u4555	m301	ALEX	Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
L138036	u4562	m301	DR. BRANOM	Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
L138347	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	I'm sure it won't be long now.
L138346	u4555	m301	ALEX	And when do I get out of here then?
L138345	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
L138344	u4555	m301	ALEX	How many did I get right?
L138343	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. I'm glad
L138342	u4555	m301	ALEX	I was quite enjoying that.
L138341	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Yes.
L138340	u4555	m301	ALEX	I hope so. Is that the end then?
L138339	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
L138338	u4555	m301	ALEX	Fucking hell...
L138337	u4555	m301	ALEX	Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
L138336	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
L138335	u4555	m301	ALEX	Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
L138334	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. What do you want?
L138333	u4555	m301	ALEX	Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
L138332	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
L138331	u4555	m301	ALEX	That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
L138330	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
L138329	u4555	m301	ALEX	Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
L138328	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
L138327	u4555	m301	ALEX	I just say what the other person would say?
L138326	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Isn't the plumage beautiful?
L138325	u4555	m301	ALEX	Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
L138324	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
L138323	u4555	m301	ALEX	Oh.
L138322	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
L138321	u4555	m301	ALEX	Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
L138320	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Yes?
L138319	u4555	m301	ALEX	Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
L138318	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
L138317	u4555	m301	ALEX	What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
L138316	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Just part of hospital routine.
L138315	u4555	m301	ALEX	Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
L138314	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	I'm your Psychiatrist.
L138313	u4555	m301	ALEX	I haven't seen you before.
L138312	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
L138311	u4555	m301	ALEX	Fine. Fine.
L138310	u4564	m301	DR. TAYLOR	How are you feeling today?
L138087	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
L138086	u4555	m301	ALEX	But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
L138085	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
L138084	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	You're not cured yet, my boy.
L138083	u4555	m301	ALEX	You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
L138080	u4555	m301	ALEX	Yes!!!
L138079	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	You're keen on music?
L138074	u4555	m301	ALEX	That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
L138073	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	What's all this about sin?
L138062	u4555	m301	ALEX	Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
L138061	u4563	m301	DR. BRODSKY	Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
L138176	u4555	m301	ALEX	Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
L138175	u4574	m301	TRAMP	They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
L138174	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
L138173	u4574	m301	TRAMP	This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
L138172	u4555	m301	ALEX	Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
L138171	u4574	m301	TRAMP	I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
L138170	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
L138169	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
L138168	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
L137680	u4574	m301	TRAMP	It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
L137679	u4555	m301	ALEX	Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
L137678	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
L137677	u4574	m301	TRAMP	Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
L137676	u4555	m301	ALEX	One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
L137979	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Amen. They cross themselves.
L137978	u4555	m301	ALEX	Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
L137977	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
L137976	u4555	m301	ALEX	I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
L137975	u4572	m301	PRIEST	The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
L137974	u4555	m301	ALEX	I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
L137973	u4572	m301	PRIEST	It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
L137972	u4555	m301	ALEX	But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
L137971	u4572	m301	PRIEST	That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
L137970	u4555	m301	ALEX	I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
L137969	u4572	m301	PRIEST	I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
L137968	u4555	m301	ALEX	These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
L137967	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
L137966	u4555	m301	ALEX	No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
L137965	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
L137964	u4555	m301	ALEX	Father - may I ask you a question in private?
L137963	u4572	m301	PRIEST	You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
L137962	u4555	m301	ALEX	And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
L137961	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Indeed.
L137960	u4555	m301	ALEX	I've done my best, have I not?
L137959	u4572	m301	PRIEST	You have, my son.
L137958	u4555	m301	ALEX	Father, I have tried, have I not?
L137957	u4572	m301	PRIEST	Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
L137956	u4555	m301	ALEX	If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
L137923	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
L137922	u4557	m301	CHECK-IN	Mothballs, sir.
L137919	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
L137918	u4557	m301	CHECK-IN	One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
L137913	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
L137912	u4557	m301	CHECK-IN	One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
L137905	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
L137904	u4557	m301	CHECK-IN	One shirt - blue, collar attached.
L137891	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Prison custody?
L137890	u4557	m301	CHECK-IN	One jacket - blue pinstripe.
L138025	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	"It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last ""i"" and smiles."
L138024	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Don't read it - sign it!
L138021	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
L138020	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
L138019	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
L138015	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
L138014	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
L138013	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Sir, 655321, sir.
L137988	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Sir.
L137987	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Carry on, Chief.
L137986	u4558	m301	CHIEF GUARD	Leave to carry on, sir, please?
L137985	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
L138193	u4560	m301	DIM	This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
L138192	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
L137794	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
L137793	u4560	m301	DIM	Moloko-plus.
L137788	u4560	m301	DIM	Big, big money.
L137787	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
L137786	u4560	m301	DIM	Yeah... Pete the English.
L137785	u4566	m301	GEORGIE	And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
L137784	u4560	m301	DIM	Pitiful rookerful...
L138305	u4571	m301	PEE	Are you feeling better?
L138304	u4565	m301	EM	Hullo, son, how are you?
L138155	u4565	m301	EM	Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
L138154	u4571	m301	PEE	D'you think we should do something?
L138151	u4565	m301	EM	Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
L138150	u4571	m301	PEE	Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
L138139	u4571	m301	PEE	Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
L138138	u4565	m301	EM	We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
L138137	u4571	m301	PEE	Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
L137744	u4565	m301	EM	Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
L137743	u4571	m301	PEE	I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
L137742	u4565	m301	EM	No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
L137741	u4571	m301	PEE	Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
L138010	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Thank you.
L138009	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Shall we go to my office?
L138006	u4569	m301	MINISTER	No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
L138005	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
L137996	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
L137995	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
L137994	u4569	m301	MINISTER	Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
L137993	u4567	m301	GOVERNOR	Four in this block, sir.
L137992	u4569	m301	MINISTER	How many to a cell?
L143230	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
L143229	u4609	m304	PETER	What?
L143228	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	There's no plug to pull.
L143227	u4609	m304	PETER	Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
L143226	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	We've lost contact.
L143224	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie?
L143223	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
L143218	u4609	m304	PETER	Anything happening in there, El?
L143217	u4599	m304	A.T.L.	I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
L143216	u4609	m304	PETER	What?
L143386	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143385	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
L143380	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
L143379	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Is it possible...?
L143378	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
L143377	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes, sir.
L143376	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	He died...  ... in 1972.
L143375	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes, sir.
L143374	u4600	m304	CHAIRMAN	... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
L142805	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
L142804	u4607	m304	KITZ	-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
L142797	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's a hoax.  I knew it!
L142796	u4607	m304	KITZ	What in the hell...?
L142788	u4607	m304	KITZ	How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
L142787	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Hope there's a cartoon.
L142768	u4607	m304	KITZ	Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
L142767	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
L142760	u4607	m304	KITZ	Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
L142759	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
L142758	u4607	m304	KITZ	Dr. Arroway --
L142677	u4606	m304	KENT	So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
L142676	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	So?
L142675	u4606	m304	KENT	Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
L142674	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Tell me.
L142673	u4606	m304	KENT	Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
L142670	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
L142669	u4606	m304	KENT	Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
L142668	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
L143136	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
L143135	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you?
L143134	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
L143133	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What would you have me say, David?
L143132	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
L143131	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Good luck, David.
L143130	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Right.  Well.
L143129	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This... seemed best.
L143128	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You aren't staying?
L143018	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
L143017	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
L143014	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
L143013	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
L142991	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
L142990	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You...
L142989	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
L142988	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?
L142987	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
L142986	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
L142985	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I don't understand.
L142984	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
L142983	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It'll just take a moment.
L142982	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Actually I'm running late --
L142981	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Do you have a minute -- ?
L142980	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie.
L142979	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David --
L142972	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
L142971	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You mean --
L142970	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
L142969	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What is it?  What's happened?
L142900	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
L142899	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
L142852	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
L142851	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Are you threatening me?
L142850	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
L142849	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie --
L142848	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
L142847	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
L142846	u4602	m304	ELLIE	With me.
L142845	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
L142844	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?  Why?
L142843	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
L142793	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
L142792	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
L142780	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
L142779	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... could it be a nested code of some sort?
L142757	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
L142756	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
L142755	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
L142704	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
L142703	u4602	m304	ELLIE	David --
L142702	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
L142701	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
L142700	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
L142699	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
L142698	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
L142697	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
L142696	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
L142695	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Meaning...
L142694	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	It's not like you've given me much choice.
L142693	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You can't just pull the plug, David.
L142692	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
L142691	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
L142690	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	You know why I'm here.
L142689	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
L142688	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Ellie...
L142687	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No doubt.
L142686	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
L142685	u4602	m304	ELLIE	'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
L142684	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
L142683	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
L142682	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
L142681	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Oh?  How's he doing?
L142680	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Peter sends his regards.
L142679	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	No, thanks.
L142678	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pepsi?  Tequila?
L142609	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
L142608	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I disagree.
L142607	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
L142606	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
L142605	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're --
L142604	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
L142603	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
L142602	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
L142601	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm willing to take that risk.
L142600	u4601	m304	DRUMLIN	I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
L142914	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Well --
L142913	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	What's the status of the decryption effort?
L142908	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
L142907	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
L142896	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
L142895	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
L142831	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	How soon will you be able to decode it?
L142830	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
L142820	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
L142819	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	What does it say?
L142859	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
L142858	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How can that be?
L142857	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	No primer.
L142856	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And?
L142855	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
L142854	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What?
L142833	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
L142832	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
L142814	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A third layer.
L142813	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
L142812	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What...
L142782	u4608	m304	LUNACHARSKY	Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
L142781	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Lunacharsky...?
L142728	u4613	m304	WILLIE	NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
L142727	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How's the spying tonight, guys?
L142723	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
L142722	u4613	m304	WILLIE	That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
L142718	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Put it on speakers.
L142717	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
L142713	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
L142712	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Got a bogey, boss?
L142665	u4602	m304	ELLIE	VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
L142664	u4613	m304	WILLIE	Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
L142663	u4602	m304	ELLIE	J39 Z186...?
L142818	u4606	m304	KENT	It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
L142817	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
L142774	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's a civilian facility.
L142773	u4606	m304	KENT	Can't we get rid of them?
L142736	u4606	m304	KENT	It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
L142735	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
L142667	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
L142666	u4606	m304	KENT	You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
L142655	u4606	m304	KENT	Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
L142654	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's beautiful.
L142653	u4606	m304	KENT	It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
L142652	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This is how you see the sky?
L142651	u4606	m304	KENT	Here, right around Centaurus A.
L142650	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Nice.  Where?
L142649	u4606	m304	KENT	1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
L142648	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ellie.  Pulsar?
L142647	u4606	m304	KENT	Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
L142646	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dr. Cullers?
L143391	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Because I can't.
L143390	u4607	m304	KITZ	So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
L143384	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
L143383	u4607	m304	KITZ	Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
L143382	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
L143381	u4607	m304	KITZ	Please answer the question, Doctor.
L143373	u4602	m304	ELLIE	By our standards... yes.
L143372	u4607	m304	KITZ	In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
L143371	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
L143370	u4607	m304	KITZ	And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
L143369	u4602	m304	ELLIE	There is no direct evidence, no.
L143334	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
L143333	u4607	m304	KITZ	Is that your official response?
L143332	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
L142826	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
L142825	u4607	m304	KITZ	If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
L142824	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
L142777	u4607	m304	KITZ	And a hundred mile airspace.
L142776	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And a hundred mile airspace.
L142775	u4607	m304	KITZ	Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
L142770	u4607	m304	KITZ	You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
L142769	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
L142766	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You want to classify prime numbers?
L142765	u4607	m304	KITZ	I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
L142764	u4602	m304	ELLIE	This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
L142763	u4607	m304	KITZ	I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
L143310	u4612	m304	TED	Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
L143309	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No.  Please.
L143308	u4612	m304	TED	It's time to go home now.
L143306	u4612	m304	TED	Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
L143305	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
L143304	u4612	m304	TED	No more stalling, Captain.
L143303	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
L143302	u4612	m304	TED	That isn't the way it works.
L143301	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
L143300	u4612	m304	TED	Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
L143299	u4602	m304	ELLIE	None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
L143298	u4612	m304	TED	If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
L143297	u4602	m304	ELLIE	No!  I mean... why so soon?
L143296	u4612	m304	TED	Now... you go home.
L143295	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  What happens now?
L143294	u4612	m304	TED	You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
L143293	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
L143292	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The librarian... or the library...?
L143291	u4612	m304	TED	Am I one... or many?
L143282	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you help us?
L143281	u4612	m304	TED	... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
L143279	u4612	m304	TED	You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
L143278	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So we passed some kind of test?
L143277	u4612	m304	TED	Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
L143276	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
L143275	u4612	m304	TED	We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
L143274	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So who...?
L143273	u4612	m304	TED	Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
L143272	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
L143271	u4612	m304	TED	Many others.
L143270	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
L143269	u4612	m304	TED	You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
L143268	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why did you contact us?
L143267	u4612	m304	TED	Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143266	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you show me?
L143265	u4612	m304	TED	Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
L143264	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So who -- what -- are you?
L143262	u4612	m304	TED	We thought this might make things a little easier.
L143261	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
L143260	u4612	m304	TED	Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
L143259	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
L143258	u4612	m304	TED	That's my scientist.
L143257	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're not real.  None of this is.
L143256	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
L143255	u4612	m304	TED	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
L143254	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
L142562	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay.
L142561	u4612	m304	TED	Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
L142558	u4612	m304	TED	That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
L142557	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pensacola.
L142556	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Okay, okay... there.
L142555	u4612	m304	TED	Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
L142554	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear God?
L142553	u4612	m304	TED	Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
L142552	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear to the moon?
L142551	u4612	m304	TED	On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
L142550	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Could we hear to China?
L142545	u4612	m304	TED	Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
L142544	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But what do I say?
L142543	u4612	m304	TED	Talk to him.
L142540	u4612	m304	TED	Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
L142539	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't move any smaller.
L142538	u4612	m304	TED	Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143162	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
L143161	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why don't you come back with me?
L143159	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- of Hadden Industries.
L143158	u4603	m304	HADDEN	As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
L143157	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Mmm.  Look closer.
L143156	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The systems integration site.
L143155	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Hokkaido Island.
L143154	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
L143153	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
L143152	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
L143151	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
L143150	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
L143149	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What are you talking about?  It's over.
L143148	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
L143147	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
L143146	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
L143145	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What's that?
L143144	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
L143143	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's so... small.
L143142	u4603	m304	HADDEN	A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
L142894	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That's my girl.  Done.
L142893	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
L142892	u4603	m304	HADDEN	In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
L142891	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And in return?
L142890	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
L142889	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A machine.  But a machine that does what?
L142888	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
L142887	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Some kind of circuitry...?
L142884	u4603	m304	HADDEN	-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
L142883	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
L142882	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Not if you think like a Vegan.
L142881	u4602	m304	ELLIE	A page-break signal.  A period.
L142880	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
L142878	u4603	m304	HADDEN	That's my girl...  Lights.
L142877	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
L142876	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
L142875	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
L142874	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
L142873	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I didn't realize I was out.
L142872	u4603	m304	HADDEN	The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
L142871	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What kind of deal?
L142870	u4603	m304	HADDEN	The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
L142869	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
L142868	u4603	m304	HADDEN	I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
L142867	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You live here.
L142866	u4603	m304	HADDEN	Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
L142865	u4602	m304	ELLIE	S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
L143122	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
L143121	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
L143120	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
L143119	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I thought you were here because you want to go.
L143118	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
L143117	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'd say this is slightly different.
L143020	u4602	m304	ELLIE	We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
L143019	u4604	m304	JEAN-CLAUDE	Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
L143331	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
L143330	u4609	m304	PETER	That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
L143329	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
L143321	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How long was I gone?
L143320	u4609	m304	PETER	What day?
L143319	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
L143318	u4609	m304	PETER	It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
L143317	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Wait -- hold on a minute --
L143316	u4609	m304	PETER	Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
L143315	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm -- I'm fine.
L143314	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie -- are you okay?
L143211	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Like it.  Almost there.
L143210	u4609	m304	PETER	Like it or not.
L143209	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That you, Valerian?
L143208	u4609	m304	PETER	It's really happening.
L143207	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Someone tell me this is really happening.
L142929	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You too.
L142928	u4609	m304	PETER	It's good to see you, Ellie.
L142921	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter.
L142920	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie.
L142644	u4609	m304	PETER	That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
L142643	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You sonofabitch.
L142642	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
L142641	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm serious about this, Peter --
L142640	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie --
L142639	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
L142638	u4609	m304	PETER	Jesus --
L142637	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
L142636	u4609	m304	PETER	Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
L142635	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
L142634	u4609	m304	PETER	'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
L142633	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But the work --
L142632	u4609	m304	PETER	This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
L142631	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But what about your research -- ?
L142630	u4609	m304	PETER	I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
L142629	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Greenbank?
L142628	u4609	m304	PETER	-- I'm moving to Washington.
L142627	u4602	m304	ELLIE	We could be together again --
L142626	u4609	m304	PETER	Actually --
L142625	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
L142624	u4609	m304	PETER	Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
L142623	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The V.L.A.?
L142622	u4609	m304	PETER	What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
L142621	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
L142620	u4609	m304	PETER	How close are you to getting this funding put together?
L142619	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
L142618	u4609	m304	PETER	Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
L142617	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
L142616	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
L142615	u4609	m304	PETER	And?
L142614	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
L142613	u4609	m304	PETER	Any luck on the grant money?
L142612	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
L142596	u4602	m304	ELLIE	'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
L142595	u4609	m304	PETER	'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
L142594	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
L142593	u4609	m304	PETER	They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
L142592	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
L142590	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
L142589	u4609	m304	PETER	Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
L142588	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
L142586	u4609	m304	PETER	Yavol.
L142585	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Sounds like a Russian general.
L142584	u4609	m304	PETER	Peter Valerian.
L142583	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Ellie.  Arroway.
L142582	u4609	m304	PETER	That's what they all say.
L142581	u4602	m304	ELLIE	He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
L142580	u4609	m304	PETER	It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
L142579	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
L143408	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
L143407	u4605	m304	JOSS	Meaning...
L143406	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
L143405	u4605	m304	JOSS	Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
L143404	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
L143403	u4605	m304	JOSS	In other words.
L143402	u4602	m304	ELLIE	In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
L143401	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143400	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
L143362	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
L143361	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
L143360	u4605	m304	JOSS	Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
L143359	u4602	m304	ELLIE	But --
L143358	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
L143357	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
L143356	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
L143355	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't have any proof, Palmer.
L143354	u4605	m304	JOSS	It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
L143353	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
L143352	u4605	m304	JOSS	I do.
L143351	u4602	m304	ELLIE	They don't believe me.
L143350	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'm not sure it's come to that.
L143349	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
L143348	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
L143347	u4605	m304	JOSS	It was quite a page turner.
L143346	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm assuming you read my deposition.
L143345	u4605	m304	JOSS	Hi.
L143344	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Hi.
L143196	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
L143195	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
L143194	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't hear this now --
L143193	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
L143192	u4602	m304	ELLIE	-- I don't know --
L143191	u4605	m304	JOSS	And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
L143190	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
L143189	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'm in love with you, Ellie.
L143188	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please --
L143187	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
L143186	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
L143185	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are you so afraid of?
L143184	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I can't do this --
L143183	u4605	m304	JOSS	What?
L143182	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm sorry -- I can't --
L143181	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie, what is it?
L143180	u4605	m304	JOSS	What is it?
L143179	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm sorry.
L143178	u4605	m304	JOSS	What...?
L143177	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe that's okay.
L143176	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
L143175	u4605	m304	JOSS	You're trembling.
L143174	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Thank you.
L143173	u4605	m304	JOSS	During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
L143172	u4605	m304	JOSS	Oh.  I brought you something.
L143171	u4602	m304	ELLIE	The final countdown.
L143170	u4605	m304	JOSS	So.  The final countdown.
L143169	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
L143168	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
L143103	u4605	m304	JOSS	What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
L143102	u4602	m304	ELLIE	How do you mean?
L143101	u4605	m304	JOSS	An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
L143100	u4602	m304	ELLIE	... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
L143098	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's late.  We should go back.
L143097	u4605	m304	JOSS	Ellie --
L143095	u4605	m304	JOSS	What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
L143094	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's getting late...
L143093	u4605	m304	JOSS	And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
L143092	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
L143091	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
L143090	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
L143089	u4605	m304	JOSS	I don't follow.
L143088	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
L143087	u4605	m304	JOSS	I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
L143086	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
L143085	u4605	m304	JOSS	I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
L143084	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
L143083	u4605	m304	JOSS	What'd you think?
L143082	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
L143081	u4605	m304	JOSS	Really.
L143080	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I read your book.
L143079	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
L143078	u4605	m304	JOSS	You're willing to die for this.
L143077	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
L143076	u4605	m304	JOSS	And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
L143075	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Something like that.
L143074	u4605	m304	JOSS	If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
L143073	u4602	m304	ELLIE	If you came back.
L143072	u4605	m304	JOSS	Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
L143071	u4602	m304	ELLIE	In other words.
L143070	u4605	m304	JOSS	In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
L143069	u4602	m304	ELLIE	It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
L143068	u4605	m304	JOSS	Why?
L143067	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I don't think so.
L143066	u4605	m304	JOSS	Maybe you're creating a monster.
L143065	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
L143064	u4605	m304	JOSS	Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
L143063	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
L143062	u4605	m304	JOSS	Some of my best friends are scientists.
L143061	u4602	m304	ELLIE	So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
L142968	u4605	m304	JOSS	Prove it.
L142967	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Yes.  Very much.
L142966	u4605	m304	JOSS	Did you love him?
L142965	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
L142964	u4605	m304	JOSS	Do you love your parents?
L142963	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
L142962	u4605	m304	JOSS	Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
L142961	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
L142960	u4605	m304	JOSS	I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
L142959	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Can you try?
L142958	u4605	m304	JOSS	... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
L142957	u4605	m304	JOSS	Now you know.
L142956	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
L142955	u4605	m304	JOSS	Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
L142954	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I flinched.
L142951	u4605	m304	JOSS	So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
L142950	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And mind, yes.  What are you --
L142949	u4605	m304	JOSS	And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
L142948	u4602	m304	ELLIE	That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
L142947	u4605	m304	JOSS	Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
L142943	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
L142942	u4605	m304	JOSS	'My father's house has many mansions.'
L142941	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
L142940	u4605	m304	JOSS	How do you mean?
L142939	u4602	m304	ELLIE	What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
L142938	u4605	m304	JOSS	Spoken like a true believer.
L142937	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
L142936	u4605	m304	JOSS	And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
L142935	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
L142934	u4605	m304	JOSS	... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
L142931	u4605	m304	JOSS	Make that two.
L142930	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Champagne please.
L142912	u4605	m304	JOSS	I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
L142911	u4602	m304	ELLIE	And where exactly does that put your position...?
L142910	u4605	m304	JOSS	I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
L143109	u4602	m304	ELLIE	For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
L143108	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
L143107	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
L143106	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
L143105	u4602	m304	ELLIE	You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
L143050	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
L143049	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
L143048	u4602	m304	ELLIE	Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
L143047	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
L143046	u4602	m304	ELLIE	I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
L143045	u4611	m304	PROJECT OFFICIAL	You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
L143342	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Have your department make a full report.
L143341	u4607	m304	KITZ	I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
L143340	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Recommendations?
L143339	u4607	m304	KITZ	... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
L142836	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
L142835	u4607	m304	KITZ	But --
L142834	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
L142816	u4607	m304	KITZ	What is it?
L142815	u4610	m304	PRESIDENT LASKER	Oh my God...
L151598	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
L151597	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Jennifer gave her a make-over.
L151596	u4727	m314	CARLTON	No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
L151585	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Can we get some service here?
L151584	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Waiter! She needs more water.
L151192	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
L151191	u4730	m314	GEORGE	My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
L151190	u4727	m314	CARLTON	I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
L151189	u4730	m314	GEORGE	I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
L151188	u4727	m314	CARLTON	What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
L151187	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
L151186	u4727	m314	CARLTON	That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
L151185	u4730	m314	GEORGE	It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
L151613	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Never felt better.
L151612	u4727	m314	CARLTON	I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
L151611	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've been working out.
L151610	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Wow your body's really hot.
L151609	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Your lips look delicious.
L151608	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What?
L151606	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah but they looked cool...
L151605	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
L151604	u4727	m314	CARLTON	James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
L151603	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151602	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
L151601	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
L151600	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've changed a lot lately.
L151599	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
L151577	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
L151576	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe ""coyote ugly"" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally ""ugly"" but is really beautiful."
L151575	u4727	m314	CARLTON	"No one I've run into knows what ""coyote ugly"" means."
L151573	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
L151572	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
L151571	u4727	m314	CARLTON	Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
L151471	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
L151470	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Does she have PMS?
L151469	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	"Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called ""The PMS Diet,"" which may be helpful."
L151468	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I get crazy dreams and I black out.
L151467	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
L151466	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
L151465	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	How have you been feeling?
L151464	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Nearly four.
L151463	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
L151264	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's not just in my head.
L151263	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
L151262	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What else is there?
L151261	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
L151260	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
L151259	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
L151258	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Good. Except for PMS.
L151257	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	How's the rest of your health?
L151255	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it was another woman.
L151254	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	A dog at Victoria's Secret?
L151253	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, on my wrist.
L151252	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	I mean where on your body?
L151251	u4729	m314	FRIDA	There was a sale.
L151250	u4729	m314	FRIDA	At Victoria's Secret.
L151249	u4728	m314	DOCTOR	A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
L151643	u4735	m314	MOTHER	It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
L151642	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
L151641	u4735	m314	MOTHER	You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
L151640	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What does that have to do with me?
L151639	u4735	m314	MOTHER	"We're worried about you. ""60 Minutes"" was on same-sex couples."
L151638	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mom!
L151637	u4735	m314	MOTHER	No it's mom.
L151636	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Jennifer?
L152038	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Sure. See ya.
L152037	u4729	m314	FRIDA	God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
L152036	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
L152035	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
L152034	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida? You okay?
L152033	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151977	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
L151976	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
L151975	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wish I only had your problems.
L151974	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
L151973	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I thought you and George were getting married.
L151972	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
L151971	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Did I kill a guy named Benito?
L151970	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	About Benito.
L151969	u4729	m314	FRIDA	About Mark? Carlton?
L151968	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I think George knows.
L151967	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see ""American Werewolf in London?"""
L151966	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No. I won't let you do that.
L151965	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
L151964	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I guess you'll find out.
L151963	u4729	m314	FRIDA	But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
L151962	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
L151961	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
L151960	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
L151959	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
L151958	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
L151957	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm cleaning my stove.
L151939	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I already have.
L151938	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Fall in love.
L151937	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So what do I do?
L151936	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What choice do we have?
L151935	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
L151934	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
L151933	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Guess she never found true love.
L151932	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
L151931	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
L151930	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves. See I knew you never loved Mark.
L151929	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
L151928	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. ""The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."""
L151926	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Check out what I found.
L151925	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem... Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
L151895	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
L151894	u4729	m314	FRIDA	The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
L151893	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
L151892	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter keeps asking me out.
L151891	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
L151868	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
L151867	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're such a good friend.
L151866	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
L151865	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
L151864	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Does that mean this whole thing is over?
L151863	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I just got my period.
L151856	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
L151855	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter knows something.
L151809	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hide him.
L151808	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What the fuck are we going to do?
L151804	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tell them you'll meet them outside.
L151803	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
L151802	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Ignore it.
L151801	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151800	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You expecting someone?
L151799	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You should have seen it erect.
L151798	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
L151791	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
L151790	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
L151789	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
L151788	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I could smell another woman on him.
L151787	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Why the fuck would you do that?
L151786	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
L151785	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
L151784	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
L151783	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
L151782	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
L151781	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
L151780	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What? Why'd you do that?
L151779	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
L151778	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why not? There's been a murder.
L151777	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	DON'T call the police.
L151776	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
L151775	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What happened to his tooth?
L151768	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah, I guess. Mark?
L151767	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	He's been here all night?
L151766	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
L151765	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Did you get rid of Mark?
L151764	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Holy shit, I don't know.
L151744	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
L151743	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, I gotta go.
L151742	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Get rid of him!
L151738	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
L151737	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
L151736	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And he was missing an arm.
L151735	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh no.
L151734	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, Carlton's dead.
L151733	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Shit, I guess I missed work.
L151732	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tuesday. Are you okay?
L151731	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've been here. What day is it?
L151730	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
L151729	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151670	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
L151669	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
L151668	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I haven't gotten it yet.
L151667	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
L151666	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
L151665	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
L151664	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
L151663	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
L151662	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
L151661	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And what makes you think you killed a man?
L151660	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I put it down the garbage disposal.
L151659	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So where's this infamous arm now?
L151634	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
L151633	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
L151632	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
L151631	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
L151630	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
L151628	u4729	m314	FRIDA	There is a man's arm in my bed.
L151627	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
L151595	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
L151594	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
L151593	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
L151592	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No they're not.
L151591	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
L151590	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No you don't, believe me.
L151589	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
L151588	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
L151587	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
L151581	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I still thought it was a purse.
L151580	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word ""bag."" It used to be ""No, that's not my bag"" -- meaning not my thing. But now ""my bag"" means ""my fault."""
L151579	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It is so hot in here.
L151578	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Charming Carlton.
L151570	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said ""Hey there beautiful."""
L151569	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I think he called you beautiful.
L151568	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What did he say?
L151566	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that.
L151565	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
L151564	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
L151559	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
L151558	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay. I guess so.
L151557	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
L151555	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
L151554	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
L151553	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
L151552	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
L151551	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How'd it go with the cop?
L151550	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I looked like an Italian man!
L151549	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
L151548	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
L151527	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, ""I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?"" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out..."
L151526	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What the hell is the tampon test?
L151525	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Give him the tampon test.
L151524	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
L151523	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
L151522	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
L151436	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
L151435	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
L151434	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
L151433	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
L151432	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
L151420	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
L151419	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wonder if he's married.
L151418	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Rule one: always wear make-up.
L151417	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
L151416	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
L151415	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
L151414	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Are those Mark's?
L151413	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My vision got worse again.
L151412	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
L151411	u4729	m314	FRIDA	And my bra finally fits again.
L151410	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	At least your PMS is over.
L151409	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
L151408	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And then?
L151407	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
L151406	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What? Why the hell did he do that?
L151405	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
L151404	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
L151403	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
L151402	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
L151401	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
L151400	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
L151399	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I don't think so.
L151398	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	No, did you fuck him?
L151397	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Did I kill him? Of course not!
L151396	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So did you do it?
L151395	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
L151394	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why would they exaggerate?
L151393	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I'm sure they were exaggerating.
L151392	u4729	m314	FRIDA	And he was ripped limb from limb?
L151391	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
L151390	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
L151322	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
L151321	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Hey, did you get contacts?
L151320	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
L151319	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Holy shit, I'm a freak.
L151318	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
L151317	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
L151316	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Where?
L151314	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
L151313	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
L151312	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"Are you kidding? He might as well say, ""Can I date rape you?"""
L151311	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Maybe they have to pee.
L151310	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. ""Can I use your phone?"" ""How about a nightcap?"" ""I want to meet your cat."" And my all-time favorite, the old standby, ""I have to use your bathroom."""
L151309	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
L151308	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
L151307	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
L151248	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
L151247	u4729	m314	FRIDA	George bit you?
L151246	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
L151245	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think she broke the skin.
L151244	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
L151243	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	And she got the medium.
L151242	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
L151236	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, grab that red one.
L151235	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where are all the mediums?
L151230	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
L151229	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know.
L151228	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
L151227	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
L151226	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
L151207	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
L151206	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Or if there's a full moon.
L151201	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
L151200	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
L151199	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Can't you get contacts?
L151198	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Only to see.
L151197	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Do you really need these?
L151196	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that.
L151195	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
L151184	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'd kill for just a little bloated.
L151183	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I get a little bloated sometimes.
L151182	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
L151181	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
L151180	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
L151179	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Maybe he's just shy.
L151178	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He hasn't said one word to me.
L151168	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	People notice you Frida.
L151167	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
L151164	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So don't look in his eyes.
L151163	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
L151162	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
L151161	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's a very talented musician.
L151160	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
L151159	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My shrink says he's not so bad.
L151158	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Anything's better than Mark.
L151157	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Translation: a total geek.
L151156	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
L151155	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
L151154	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
L151153	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
L151358	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
L151357	u4731	m314	GREGORY	So pee? Here?
L151356	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh huh. So pee.
L151355	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
L151354	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
L151353	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Yes I do have to pee!
L151352	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You don't have to pee.
L151351	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Knock what off?
L151350	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh come on. Knock it off.
L151349	u4731	m314	GREGORY	That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
L151348	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My apartment's just such a mess.
L151347	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I didn't have to pee then.
L151346	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You should have gone at the restaurant.
L151345	u4731	m314	GREGORY	I really gotta pee.
L151344	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What?
L151342	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
L151341	u4731	m314	GREGORY	They say sex is great for cramps.
L151340	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
L151339	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
L151338	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm really tired.
L151337	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Hey, how about a little nightcap?
L151336	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
L151334	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's great. Highly original.
L151333	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Well, whattdaya think?
L151332	u4731	m314	GREGORY	"So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, ""Son, you got into Harvard!"" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating."
L151328	u4731	m314	GREGORY	You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
L151327	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm not really hungry after all.
L151326	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
L151324	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Starving.
L151323	u4731	m314	GREGORY	You hungry?
L151276	u4731	m314	GREGORY	No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
L151275	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You're kidding, really?
L151274	u4731	m314	GREGORY	Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
L151273	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I do development for TV movies.
L151272	u4731	m314	GREGORY	So you're Grant's secretary?
L151271	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I know.
L151762	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Take your shower.
L151761	u4734	m314	MARK	Wow.
L151760	u4734	m314	MARK	Yeah?
L151759	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mark.
L151756	u4734	m314	MARK	I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
L151755	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My bra is my biggest supporter.
L151754	u4734	m314	MARK	Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
L151753	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
L151752	u4734	m314	MARK	It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
L151751	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
L151750	u4734	m314	MARK	These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
L151749	u4729	m314	FRIDA	So pay them back and apologize.
L151748	u4734	m314	MARK	I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
L151747	u4734	m314	MARK	Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
L151746	u4729	m314	FRIDA	This really isn't a good time.
L151745	u4734	m314	MARK	It's a matter of life and death.
L151741	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's Mark.
L151740	u4734	m314	MARK	Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
L151480	u4734	m314	MARK	I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
L151479	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Where'd you get the bike?
L151306	u4734	m314	MARK	I'm working on it...
L151305	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
L151304	u4734	m314	MARK	Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
L151303	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah right... You better go.
L151302	u4734	m314	MARK	Frida, you know you're it for me.
L151301	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
L151300	u4734	m314	MARK	OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
L151298	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't help it, it smells so good.
L151297	u4734	m314	MARK	Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
L151296	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, I'm sorry!
L151295	u4734	m314	MARK	Look what you did!
L151293	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151292	u4734	m314	MARK	You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
L151291	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You never say that.
L151290	u4734	m314	MARK	You look different. I mean you look good.
L151288	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Since when do you care?
L151287	u4734	m314	MARK	What, you got a date or somethin'?
L151874	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Very well then. Is that all?
L151873	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
L151872	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	No?
L151871	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No.
L151870	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
L151869	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
L151462	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
L151461	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think we should do something with strong female characters...
L151460	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Yes, that's what we're looking for.
L151459	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
L151440	u4729	m314	FRIDA	A little.
L151439	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Did you change your hair?
L151438	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?"
L151219	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Your desk.
L151218	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Coffee and...
L151217	u4729	m314	FRIDA	On your desk.
L151216	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	Script coverage?
L151215	u4729	m314	FRIDA	On your desk.
L151214	u4736	m314	MR. GRANT	The Nielson's?
L152042	u4737	m314	PETER	Thanks.
L152041	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Here's a towel.
L152030	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay.
L152029	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm going to take a shower.
L152026	u4737	m314	PETER	I know. The important thing is that it stop.
L152025	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
L152024	u4737	m314	PETER	No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
L152023	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What about... those guys... I might have...
L152022	u4737	m314	PETER	Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
L152021	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Worse than this?
L152020	u4737	m314	PETER	We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
L152019	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
L152018	u4737	m314	PETER	I knew you wouldn't kill me.
L152015	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
L152014	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
L152013	u4737	m314	PETER	Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
L152012	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Be careful!
L152010	u4737	m314	PETER	I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
L152009	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
L152008	u4737	m314	PETER	I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
L152007	u4729	m314	FRIDA	How do you know?
L152006	u4737	m314	PETER	I don't think you'll hurt me.
L152005	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Peter I love you too but...
L152004	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
L152003	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Go away. I might hurt you.
L151992	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
L151991	u4737	m314	PETER	If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
L151990	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
L151989	u4737	m314	PETER	Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
L151988	u4729	m314	FRIDA	You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
L151987	u4737	m314	PETER	You at least owe me the truth.
L151986	u4737	m314	PETER	Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
L151985	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
L151984	u4737	m314	PETER	What? Is there someone else?
L151983	u4729	m314	FRIDA	NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
L151982	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
L151981	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Hello?
L151944	u4737	m314	PETER	No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
L151943	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
L151942	u4737	m314	PETER	No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
L151941	u4729	m314	FRIDA	They do? Oh no...
L151940	u4737	m314	PETER	Your breasts feel larger.
L151913	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
L151912	u4737	m314	PETER	You know, I've never seen your cat.
L151911	u4729	m314	FRIDA	They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
L151910	u4737	m314	PETER	What's with the squirt guns?
L151909	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I love you too.
L151908	u4737	m314	PETER	You didn't say it.
L151907	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
L151906	u4737	m314	PETER	Is that how you feel?
L151905	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say ""I love you too"" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it."
L151904	u4737	m314	PETER	Is it that funny?
L151902	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, my bite's a lot worse.
L151901	u4737	m314	PETER	You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
L151900	u4729	m314	FRIDA	"This is a lot worse than ""Betty."""
L151899	u4737	m314	PETER	"That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, ""You're talking to Betty now"" and we'd leave the house for a few days."
L151889	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Interesting possibility.
L151888	u4737	m314	PETER	Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
L151887	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, but thanks for the warning.
L151886	u4737	m314	PETER	Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
L151885	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What's that supposed to mean?
L151884	u4737	m314	PETER	Except Mark of course.
L151883	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
L151882	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
L151881	u4737	m314	PETER	I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
L151880	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What happened?
L151879	u4737	m314	PETER	What happened?
L151878	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I got it. It's okay.
L151877	u4737	m314	PETER	I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
L151876	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
L151875	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
L151851	u4737	m314	PETER	He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
L151850	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, why?
L151848	u4737	m314	PETER	Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
L151847	u4729	m314	FRIDA	But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
L151845	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
L151844	u4737	m314	PETER	No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
L151824	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
L151823	u4737	m314	PETER	You had a date with Carlton?
L151807	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
L151806	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
L151805	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Uh.... hi!
L151658	u4737	m314	PETER	A man killed in Central Park.
L151657	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Everything okay?
L151653	u4729	m314	FRIDA	NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
L151652	u4737	m314	PETER	You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
L151651	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Nope, nothing in it.
L151650	u4737	m314	PETER	Was there anything in that washer?
L151648	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
L151647	u4737	m314	PETER	No. I was doing my laundry.
L151646	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
L151546	u4737	m314	PETER	Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
L151545	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
L151544	u4737	m314	PETER	I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
L151541	u4729	m314	FRIDA	My period? No.
L151540	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
L151539	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What's wrong?
L151538	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Okay, you busted me.
L151537	u4737	m314	PETER	I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
L151534	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
L151533	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What are they for?
L151532	u4737	m314	PETER	Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
L151531	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What are those?
L151521	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Goodnight.
L151520	u4737	m314	PETER	Goodnight.
L151519	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yeah. Maybe.
L151518	u4737	m314	PETER	Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
L151517	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I really gotta get going.
L151516	u4729	m314	FRIDA	He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
L151515	u4737	m314	PETER	Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
L151514	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
L151513	u4737	m314	PETER	Briefs.
L151512	u4729	m314	FRIDA	How about you? Briefs or boxers?
L151510	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
L151509	u4729	m314	FRIDA	A lot of people don't wear underwear.
L151508	u4737	m314	PETER	You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
L151507	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Like what?
L151506	u4737	m314	PETER	Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
L151505	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
L151504	u4737	m314	PETER	The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
L151503	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
L151502	u4737	m314	PETER	We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
L151501	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, by wolves?
L151500	u4737	m314	PETER	I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
L151499	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm sorry.
L151498	u4737	m314	PETER	No, she died when I was twelve.
L151497	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Used to? Did it stop finally?
L151496	u4737	m314	PETER	My mom used to get PMS too.
L151495	u4737	m314	PETER	I can forgive you a bestseller.
L151494	u4729	m314	FRIDA	It's stupid.
L151493	u4737	m314	PETER	No really, I love knowing what people read.
L151492	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh, it's nothing.
L151491	u4737	m314	PETER	So what book did you buy?
L151490	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
L151489	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
L151488	u4737	m314	PETER	Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
L151487	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
L151486	u4737	m314	PETER	You wanna get some coffee?
L151485	u4737	m314	PETER	There's a lot of that going around.
L151484	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
L151483	u4737	m314	PETER	Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
L151477	u4737	m314	PETER	At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
L151476	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
L151475	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Intriguing?
L151474	u4737	m314	PETER	No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
L151473	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Are you following me?
L151472	u4737	m314	PETER	You busted me.
L151383	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
L151382	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
L151377	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
L151376	u4737	m314	PETER	When's the last time you saw him?
L151680	u4738	m314	SHRINK	"You use the word ""fucking."" You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex."
L151679	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
L151678	u4738	m314	SHRINK	"You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?"
L151677	u4729	m314	FRIDA	We didn't have sex.
L151676	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
L151675	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
L151674	u4738	m314	SHRINK	And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
L151673	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I ate a guy last night.
L151672	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
L151671	u4729	m314	FRIDA	I think I'm a werewolf.
L151225	u4738	m314	SHRINK	Oh, I see... interesting theory.
L151224	u4729	m314	FRIDA	That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
L151840	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Packages of money.
L151839	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
L151832	u4733	m314	LLOYD	How big?
L151831	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I have a cat.
L151830	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You got a dog?
L151829	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
L151826	u4729	m314	FRIDA	What makes you think I was the last one?
L151825	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
L151822	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
L151821	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You heard about Carlton Fraser?
L151388	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, take it.
L151387	u4733	m314	LLOYD	We can get a warrant if you like.
L151379	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, I said it was our first date.
L151378	u4733	m314	LLOYD	A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
L151375	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
L151374	u4729	m314	FRIDA	No, it was our first date.
L151373	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
L151372	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Yes... I... we had dinner.
L151366	u4729	m314	FRIDA	Oh my god, what happened?
L151365	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
L151688	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
L151687	u4730	m314	GEORGE	You can't believe this bullshit.
L151686	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Take some allergy medicine.
L151685	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
L151684	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
L151683	u4730	m314	GEORGE	You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
L151682	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
L151681	u4730	m314	GEORGE	I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
L151626	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Tell her I'm eating.
L151625	u4730	m314	GEORGE	It's for you. Frida.
L151617	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
L151616	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
L151615	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
L151563	u4730	m314	GEORGE	She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
L151562	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
L151561	u4730	m314	GEORGE	She's just so... pathetic.
L151560	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
L151205	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
L151204	u4730	m314	GEORGE	He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
L151171	u4730	m314	GEORGE	Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
L151170	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	"So I asked the bartender what ""coyote ugly"" meant. It's like the ""bagger"" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger..."
L151838	u4737	m314	PETER	He's been running money for the Mafia.
L151837	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	See he was cheating from the get go.
L151817	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
L151816	u4737	m314	PETER	Why would you want to be a cop?
L151815	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
L151386	u4737	m314	PETER	We can just take this pillowcase.
L151385	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	You want her sheets?
L151381	u4737	m314	PETER	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
L151380	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	How the hell is that your business?
L151371	u4737	m314	PETER	Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
L151370	u4732	m314	JENNIFER	Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
L152002	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
L152001	u4737	m314	PETER	What kind of animal?
L152000	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
L151999	u4737	m314	PETER	Did we get those DNA tests back?
L151998	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And that was 28 days ago today.
L151997	u4737	m314	PETER	So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
L151996	u4733	m314	LLOYD	She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
L151995	u4737	m314	PETER	What makes her think that?
L151994	u4733	m314	LLOYD	My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
L151924	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
L151923	u4737	m314	PETER	What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
L151922	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
L151921	u4737	m314	PETER	What are you talking about?
L151920	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And fifth, you're dating her.
L151919	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
L151918	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
L151917	u4737	m314	PETER	Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
L151916	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You think mafia hit?
L151860	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Like a vampire or some shit?
L151859	u4737	m314	PETER	It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
L151858	u4733	m314	LLOYD	It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
L151857	u4737	m314	PETER	Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
L151842	u4733	m314	LLOYD	One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
L151841	u4737	m314	PETER	Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
L151828	u4733	m314	LLOYD	This one walk you home too?
L151827	u4737	m314	PETER	He means the last that we know of.
L151797	u4737	m314	PETER	She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
L151796	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
L151795	u4737	m314	PETER	Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
L151794	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
L151793	u4737	m314	PETER	The park dude was missing an arm.
L151792	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
L151726	u4737	m314	PETER	You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
L151725	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
L151724	u4737	m314	PETER	She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
L151723	u4733	m314	LLOYD	She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
L151722	u4737	m314	PETER	Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
L151721	u4733	m314	LLOYD	This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
L151720	u4737	m314	PETER	We only live a few blocks apart.
L151719	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
L151697	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And he was missing an arm.
L151696	u4737	m314	PETER	He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
L151455	u4733	m314	LLOYD	And you think I'm sick?
L151454	u4737	m314	PETER	What?
L151453	u4737	m314	PETER	Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
L151452	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
L151451	u4737	m314	PETER	Madonna's in Penthouse?
L151450	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
L151449	u4737	m314	PETER	Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
L151448	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
L151447	u4737	m314	PETER	She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
L151446	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hey, there was a lot of blood.
L151445	u4737	m314	PETER	I told you she was innocent.
L151444	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
L151427	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
L151426	u4737	m314	PETER	I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
L151425	u4733	m314	LLOYD	No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
L151424	u4737	m314	PETER	Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
L151423	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
L151422	u4737	m314	PETER	That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
L151421	u4733	m314	LLOYD	I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
L151368	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
L151367	u4737	m314	PETER	He was found a few blocks away.
L151281	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
L151280	u4737	m314	PETER	You're some catch Lloyd.
L151279	u4733	m314	LLOYD	You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
L151278	u4737	m314	PETER	Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
L151277	u4733	m314	LLOYD	Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
L153146	u4739	m315	BARBER	Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
L153145	u4749	m315	WHITE	Not really...
L153144	u4739	m315	BARBER	Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
L153141	u4739	m315	BARBER	Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
L153140	u4749	m315	WHITE	The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
L153139	u4739	m315	BARBER	What of?
L153138	u4749	m315	WHITE	Sell maps?
L153135	u4739	m315	BARBER	Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
L153134	u4749	m315	WHITE	Thanks.  Just some pills.
L153133	u4739	m315	BARBER	Looks like you need a haircut to me.
L153132	u4749	m315	WHITE	I need something to keep me awake.
L153400	u4741	m315	COP	Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
L153399	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How will we interrogate them?
L153398	u4741	m315	COP	They don't speak English...
L153393	u4741	m315	COP	No one available.
L153392	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
L153391	u4741	m315	COP	His wife.
L153390	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	The other one?
L153389	u4741	m315	COP	All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
L153293	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
L153292	u4741	m315	COP	Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
L153291	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What's he doing here?
L153174	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Spinning backwards?
L153173	u4741	m315	COP	Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
L153172	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How long have you been here?
L153488	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I'm afraid so.
L153487	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Was that for real down there?
L153467	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
L153466	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What is this place?
L153465	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Just like that?
L153464	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	In there.
L153463	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
L153462	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Please, they'll kill me...
L153459	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You are mistaken.
L153458	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
L153457	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I don't know what you're talking about.
L153456	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
L153322	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Loose ends?
L153321	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
L153320	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
L153319	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
L153318	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	He's seriously disturbed...
L153317	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Really?  And how is his state of mind?
L153316	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Just visiting my patient.
L153315	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Doctor!  What brings you here?
L153255	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
L153254	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	He tried to kill me!
L153253	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Police.  Nobody move.
L153340	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir.
L153339	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
L153335	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	How could you have been so stupid?
L153334	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
L153329	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I see...
L153328	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
L153131	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
L153130	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Lost something?
L153129	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
L153128	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
L153127	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Its extremely important to my investigation...
L153126	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	A hunch.  He might be able to...
L153125	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Why do you want to speak to him?
L153072	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
L153071	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
L153070	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
L153068	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
L153067	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
L153066	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
L153062	u4747	m315	STROMBOLI	Yes.  This way.
L153061	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Good evening, sir.
L153417	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
L153416	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
L153415	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
L153413	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Put it through...
L153412	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
L153411	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Who is it?
L153119	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Well be more careful, please.
L153118	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Why, yes.
L153117	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Do you wash your hands before you type things?
L153116	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Im sorry...
L153115	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	How can I submit this?
L153114	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
L153113	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	It seems fine.
L153112	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Wrong?  Look at this!
L153111	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
L153110	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	You typed this report?
L153097	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Fine.
L153096	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	You wont regret this, sir.
L153095	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Good.
L153094	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
L153093	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
L153092	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I didnt requisition a secretary.
L153091	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Im your new assistant.
L153090	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Patricia Crenshaw.
L153089	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
L153088	u4743	m315	MISS CRENSHAW	Sorry, sir.
L153087	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Dammit!
L153492	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
L153491	u4749	m315	WHITE	What now?
L153472	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	It sure isn't the fun-fair.
L153471	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where do you think this goes?
L153454	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
L153453	u4749	m315	WHITE	Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
L153452	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Go on.
L153449	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
L153448	u4749	m315	WHITE	What?
L153447	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	They didn't have faces.
L153428	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Don't know much, do you?
L153427	u4749	m315	WHITE	Don't know that either.
L153426	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why are they after you?
L153425	u4749	m315	WHITE	I don't know who they are.
L153424	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Who?
L153423	u4749	m315	WHITE	People...  after me.
L153422	u4749	m315	WHITE	I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
L153421	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
L153420	u4749	m315	WHITE	I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
L153419	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Why give yourself up?
L153267	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Shut-up.
L153266	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where are we going?
L153385	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
L153384	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	But...  How long has this been happening?
L153383	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	No...  No doctor...
L153382	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
L153379	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What is going on?
L153378	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
L153377	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	What?  Who has?
L153376	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	They've taken my mind, my memories...
L153372	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Not that.  Anything else.
L153371	u4740	m315	BUMSTEAD	I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
L153370	u4748	m315	THOMPSON	Can't let you in...  sorry.
L153517	u4742	m315	KARL	It must be a closet or something.
L153516	u4749	m315	WHITE	Where does it lead?
L153515	u4742	m315	KARL	Yes.
L153514	u4749	m315	WHITE	You see it?
L153513	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  Have a look.
L153512	u4742	m315	KARL	Such a joker!  Like your father.
L153511	u4749	m315	WHITE	There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
L153510	u4742	m315	KARL	Which one?
L153509	u4749	m315	WHITE	What is that door?
L153508	u4742	m315	KARL	Look!  This is a good one!
L153588	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
L153587	u4749	m315	WHITE	I didn't realise...
L153584	u4749	m315	WHITE	Wait, this isn't fair...
L153583	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	I see.  The verdict, yes...
L153582	u4749	m315	WHITE	But I...
L153581	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	A book of delusions.  Anything else?
L153574	u4749	m315	WHITE	Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
L153573	u4744	m315	MISTER BLACK	A fanciful idea, Mister White.
L153170	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Please...
L153169	u4749	m315	WHITE	Shut up!
L153168	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Dont kill me!
L153165	u4749	m315	WHITE	Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
L153164	u4745	m315	PRIEST	I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
L153163	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
L153162	u4745	m315	PRIEST	Then we must call the police.
L153161	u4749	m315	WHITE	Someones after me.
L153160	u4745	m315	PRIEST	You seem restless.
L153159	u4749	m315	WHITE	No.  I, ah...
L153543	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	We are...  living in their dreams...
L153542	u4749	m315	WHITE	What is it?
L153540	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I'm...  being...  punished.
L153539	u4749	m315	WHITE	What happened to you?
L153461	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Nothing.  I don't know anything!
L153460	u4749	m315	WHITE	What are you hiding?
L153312	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
L153311	u4749	m315	WHITE	It's a trick.
L153308	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
L153307	u4749	m315	WHITE	Why?
L153306	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
L153305	u4749	m315	WHITE	You've been working too hard.
L153302	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
L153301	u4749	m315	WHITE	Not that again...
L153300	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
L153299	u4749	m315	WHITE	So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
L153298	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	No, it's the truth.
L153297	u4749	m315	WHITE	You're a liar!
L153243	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
L153242	u4749	m315	WHITE	I have to go...
L153241	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	What are you doing?
L153231	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
L153230	u4749	m315	WHITE	I'm sorry.  About before.
L153222	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Maybe.
L153221	u4749	m315	WHITE	Can I get my life back?
L153219	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
L153218	u4749	m315	WHITE	I'm nothing then.
L153217	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
L153215	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
L153214	u4749	m315	WHITE	Horrible...
L153213	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
L153212	u4749	m315	WHITE	Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
L153209	u4749	m315	WHITE	I told you, I can't remember a thing!
L153208	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
L153207	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Well...
L153206	u4749	m315	WHITE	Known me for long?
L153205	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
L153204	u4749	m315	WHITE	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
L153203	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	If you like.
L153202	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Tell me about them...
L153201	u4749	m315	WHITE	Yes.
L153200	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Bad dreams?
L153199	u4749	m315	WHITE	That's what people keep telling me.
L153198	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Your name is John White.
L153197	u4749	m315	WHITE	Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
L153196	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	What does she say?  The woman.
L153195	u4749	m315	WHITE	Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
L153194	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Water?
L153193	u4749	m315	WHITE	You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
L153192	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
L153191	u4749	m315	WHITE	You know something about me?
L153190	u4746	m315	SCHREBER	You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
L153364	u4750	m315	WIFE	That's easy.  You...
L153363	u4749	m315	WHITE	How do I get there?  Tell me.
L153356	u4750	m315	WIFE	They're dead, John.
L153355	u4749	m315	WHITE	I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
L153354	u4750	m315	WIFE	Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
L153353	u4749	m315	WHITE	How do you know I'm innocent?
L153352	u4750	m315	WIFE	It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
L153351	u4749	m315	WHITE	I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
L156800	u4760	m317	CHICO	Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
L156799	u4769	m317	RHODES	How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
L156798	u4760	m317	CHICO	To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
L156797	u4769	m317	RHODES	Then why did you come here?
L156796	u4760	m317	CHICO	There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
L156795	u4769	m317	RHODES	Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
L156794	u4760	m317	CHICO	The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
L156793	u4769	m317	RHODES	I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
L156792	u4760	m317	CHICO	Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
L156791	u4769	m317	RHODES	I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
L156790	u4760	m317	CHICO	NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
L156789	u4769	m317	RHODES	After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
L156788	u4769	m317	RHODES	And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
L156787	u4760	m317	CHICO	Please....shoot me.
L156783	u4769	m317	RHODES	Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
L156782	u4760	m317	CHICO	Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
L156765	u4770	m317	SARAH	Come on.
L156764	u4760	m317	CHICO	It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
L156762	u4770	m317	SARAH	Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
L156761	u4760	m317	CHICO	What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
L156760	u4770	m317	SARAH	Look.
L156759	u4760	m317	CHICO	It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
L156758	u4760	m317	CHICO	I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
L156757	u4770	m317	SARAH	What is it?
L156751	u4770	m317	SARAH	No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
L156750	u4760	m317	CHICO	His madness....could be from shock.
L156723	u4760	m317	CHICO	Leave him.
L156722	u4770	m317	SARAH	Help me get him to the boat.
L157112	u4765	m317	LOGAN	Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
L157111	u4761	m317	DIESEL	You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
L157079	u4765	m317	LOGAN	Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
L157078	u4761	m317	DIESEL	Quiet!
L157077	u4765	m317	LOGAN	I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
L156935	u4765	m317	LOGAN	I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
L156934	u4761	m317	DIESEL	Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
L156923	u4761	m317	DIESEL	The tunnel.
L156922	u4765	m317	LOGAN	What is it?
L157001	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
L157000	u4767	m317	MARY	It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
L156999	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
L156998	u4767	m317	MARY	We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
L156997	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
L156990	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
L156989	u4767	m317	MARY	Tonight?
L156988	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
L156987	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
L156986	u4767	m317	MARY	I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
L156985	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
L156984	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
L156983	u4767	m317	MARY	THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
L156982	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
L156981	u4767	m317	MARY	Sir. It's quite clear that...
L156977	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
L156976	u4767	m317	MARY	...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
L156975	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Miss Henried, I think you better...
L156972	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
L156971	u4767	m317	MARY	I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
L156970	u4762	m317	GASPARILLA	Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
L157179	u4763	m317	JOHN	Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
L157178	u4770	m317	SARAH	How long do we have to watch him?
L157159	u4770	m317	SARAH	It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
L157158	u4763	m317	JOHN	What is it?
L157063	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
L157062	u4770	m317	SARAH	Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
L157057	u4770	m317	SARAH	There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
L157056	u4763	m317	JOHN	We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
L157055	u4770	m317	SARAH	Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
L157054	u4763	m317	JOHN	Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
L157053	u4770	m317	SARAH	What?
L157052	u4763	m317	JOHN	Datura.
L157051	u4770	m317	SARAH	Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
L157006	u4763	m317	JOHN	He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
L157005	u4770	m317	SARAH	Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
L156941	u4763	m317	JOHN	You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
L156940	u4770	m317	SARAH	They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
L156845	u4770	m317	SARAH	No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
L156844	u4763	m317	JOHN	Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
L156843	u4770	m317	SARAH	I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
L156841	u4763	m317	JOHN	You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
L156840	u4770	m317	SARAH	Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
L156839	u4763	m317	JOHN	That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
L156838	u4770	m317	SARAH	Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
L156837	u4763	m317	JOHN	I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
L156836	u4770	m317	SARAH	We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
L156835	u4763	m317	JOHN	That sounds like a curse to me.
L156834	u4770	m317	SARAH	It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
L156833	u4763	m317	JOHN	What is it if it ain't a curse?
L156832	u4770	m317	SARAH	Curse?
L156831	u4763	m317	JOHN	How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
L156830	u4770	m317	SARAH	The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
L156828	u4763	m317	JOHN	I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
L156827	u4770	m317	SARAH	Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
L156825	u4763	m317	JOHN	Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
L156824	u4770	m317	SARAH	We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
L156823	u4763	m317	JOHN	That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
L156822	u4770	m317	SARAH	Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
L156821	u4763	m317	JOHN	He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
L156820	u4770	m317	SARAH	Gasparilla?
L156819	u4763	m317	JOHN	Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
L157106	u4771	m317	TOBY	Come on!
L157105	u4763	m317	JOHN	What you wanna do?
L157104	u4771	m317	TOBY	That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
L157065	u4763	m317	JOHN	Come on. Let's go.
L157064	u4771	m317	TOBY	That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
L157061	u4763	m317	JOHN	I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
L157060	u4771	m317	TOBY	If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
L157059	u4763	m317	JOHN	Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
L157058	u4771	m317	TOBY	This stuff really works? No shit?
L157044	u4771	m317	TOBY	A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
L157043	u4763	m317	JOHN	We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
L157042	u4771	m317	TOBY	What?
L157041	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
L157040	u4771	m317	TOBY	Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
L157039	u4763	m317	JOHN	We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
L157038	u4771	m317	TOBY	It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
L157029	u4771	m317	TOBY	I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
L157028	u4763	m317	JOHN	I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
L157027	u4771	m317	TOBY	What?
L157026	u4763	m317	JOHN	We got a boat.
L157025	u4771	m317	TOBY	There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
L157024	u4771	m317	TOBY	He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
L157023	u4763	m317	JOHN	What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
L157013	u4763	m317	JOHN	Maybe.
L157012	u4771	m317	TOBY	Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
L157011	u4763	m317	JOHN	The hospital? 
L157010	u4771	m317	TOBY	I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
L157009	u4771	m317	TOBY	Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
L157008	u4763	m317	JOHN	Ain't no place safe.
L157007	u4771	m317	TOBY	It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
L156866	u4769	m317	RHODES	The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
L156865	u4764	m317	JULIE	I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
L156864	u4769	m317	RHODES	They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
L156863	u4764	m317	JULIE	But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
L156862	u4769	m317	RHODES	Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
L156861	u4764	m317	JULIE	I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
L156743	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
L156742	u4766	m317	MARIA	You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
L156741	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
L156740	u4766	m317	MARIA	We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
L156739	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
L156733	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
L156732	u4766	m317	MARIA	You are dying, too.
L156731	u4768	m317	MIGUEL	He is dying. He knows it.
L156730	u4772	m317	TONY	...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
L156729	u4766	m317	MARIA	NOOOOOOOOO!
L156727	u4772	m317	TONY	I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
L156726	u4766	m317	MARIA	Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
L156725	u4772	m317	TONY	Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
L156721	u4772	m317	TONY	PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
L156720	u4766	m317	MARIA	TONY....TONY....
L156706	u4772	m317	TONY	I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
L156705	u4766	m317	MARIA	Dios mia.
L156974	u4767	m317	MARY	Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
L156973	u4769	m317	RHODES	Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
L156887	u4769	m317	RHODES	No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
L156886	u4767	m317	MARY	You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
L156885	u4769	m317	RHODES	I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
L156881	u4767	m317	MARY	Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
L156880	u4769	m317	RHODES	Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
L156879	u4767	m317	MARY	If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
L156878	u4769	m317	RHODES	Oh, I have no doubt.
L156877	u4767	m317	MARY	Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
L156876	u4769	m317	RHODES	And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
L156875	u4767	m317	MARY	You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
L156874	u4767	m317	MARY	Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
L156873	u4769	m317	RHODES	You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
L156868	u4769	m317	RHODES	They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
L156867	u4767	m317	MARY	You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
L156859	u4769	m317	RHODES	No wonder they're so....hungry.
L156858	u4767	m317	MARY	You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
L156857	u4769	m317	RHODES	God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
L156856	u4767	m317	MARY	God....damn you, Rhodes!
L156855	u4769	m317	RHODES	Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
L156911	u4771	m317	TOBY	MARY!
L156910	u4767	m317	MARY	I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
L156909	u4771	m317	TOBY	Mary.
L156900	u4771	m317	TOBY	For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
L156899	u4767	m317	MARY	I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
L156898	u4771	m317	TOBY	Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
L156897	u4767	m317	MARY	I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
L156896	u4771	m317	TOBY	We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
L156895	u4767	m317	MARY	I want you to leave. Then maybe...
L156894	u4771	m317	TOBY	Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
L156893	u4767	m317	MARY	It's because of me.
L156892	u4771	m317	TOBY	That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
L156891	u4767	m317	MARY	Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
L156890	u4771	m317	TOBY	Hey. Slow down. What is it?
L156889	u4767	m317	MARY	Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
L156814	u4771	m317	TOBY	In the battle, sir.
L156813	u4769	m317	RHODES	It's been fired.
L156812	u4769	m317	RHODES	Let me see your weapon.
L156811	u4771	m317	TOBY	No, sir.
L156810	u4769	m317	RHODES	You fired that shot, didn't you?
L156809	u4771	m317	TOBY	Sir!
L156808	u4769	m317	RHODES	Step up here, Tyler.
L156805	u4769	m317	RHODES	I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
L156804	u4771	m317	TOBY	Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
L156803	u4769	m317	RHODES	No time for that. I'll take care of them.
L156802	u4771	m317	TOBY	"My...""detail"", sir. We're going to bury the heads."
L156801	u4769	m317	RHODES	Where are you going, Tyler?
L157146	u4773	m317	TRICKS	I'm alright. Let's go.
L157145	u4771	m317	TOBY	Tricks...Jesus...
L157018	u4771	m317	TOBY	We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
L157017	u4773	m317	TRICKS	Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
L157016	u4771	m317	TOBY	What'dya get?
L157015	u4773	m317	TRICKS	Not as bad as yours, pal.
L157014	u4771	m317	TOBY	Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
L159997	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
L159996	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	They are...they are everywhere.
L159993	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	We're going to die here! We're going to die!
L159992	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's not going to help us!
L159977	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Why don't you want a message sent?
L159976	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	He's the owner...
L159975	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who are you?
L159960	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	We have to make it to the third deck...
L159959	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	How do we get out of here?
L159958	u4789	m319	CAPTAIN	Yes.
L159957	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You the Captain?
L160110	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
L160109	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	And what? These things are octopusses?
L160108	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
L160107	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	What the hell are you talking about?
L160106	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
L160105	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
L160104	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
L160101	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Boat or no boat...I'm going...
L160100	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
L160097	u4792	m319	MAMOOLI	Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
L160096	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who?
L160124	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
L160123	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Maybe we lost them.
L160059	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Just trying to get to my boat...
L160058	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
L160057	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	That's where my boat's moored.
L160056	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Who gives a shit about aft?
L159943	u4791	m319	HANOVER	With who?
L159942	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Did you clear this?
L159941	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
L159938	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I told you...
L159937	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
L159936	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Shut up!
L159935	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Hanover, listen...
L159928	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Dead.
L159927	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Where are my men?
L159793	u4791	m319	HANOVER	I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
L159792	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
L159791	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
L159790	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
L159775	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Then you better start swimming.
L159774	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Not an option.
L159773	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You're going to have to get a new one.
L159772	u4791	m319	HANOVER	We were talking about my schedule...
L159769	u4791	m319	HANOVER	I have a schedule...
L159768	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
L159767	u4791	m319	HANOVER	How soon can we get up and running?
L159766	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
L159723	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
L159722	u4791	m319	HANOVER	He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
L159721	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Who asked any?
L159720	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And no questions asked.
L159719	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
L159718	u4791	m319	HANOVER	This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
L159670	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
L159669	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
L159665	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
L159664	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
L159663	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Which question is that?
L159662	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
L159661	u4791	m319	HANOVER	And where is our point of arrival?
L159660	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...
L159658	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
L159657	u4791	m319	HANOVER	No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
L159656	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
L159655	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
L160248	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	He's not coming...
L160247	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Where's you friend?
L160244	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	This time, make an exception.
L160243	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I don't take orders at all.
L160242	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You don't take orders very well, do you?
L160241	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	No...
L160240	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
L160239	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Soon as I get over the heart attack...
L160238	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
L160201	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	And what if I run into one of those things?
L160200	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
L160199	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You want ME to go up there?
L160196	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Right...
L160195	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
L160186	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Jet ski...there's one left up there.
L160185	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
L160184	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
L160181	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
L160180	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Yeah...
L160179	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Finnegan...
L160172	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Not like him.
L160171	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
L160160	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
L160159	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What?
L160158	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's not them...it's it...
L160151	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Keep tasting...
L160150	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
L160143	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
L160142	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
L160138	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You should talk...
L160137	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Looking good...
L160127	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	We can't just leave them here.
L160126	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	A meat locker.
L160125	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What is it?
L160122	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The quiet...
L160121	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What's the matter?
L160119	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm saying they're calling the shots...
L160118	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You're saying they can think?
L160117	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Like cattle...
L160041	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Takes one to know one.
L160040	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	How do you know that?
L160039	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	"The ""come back"" kind."
L160038	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Oh yeah? What kind is that?
L160037	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
L160036	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Right... You have a boat.
L160035	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Yeah you did...
L160034	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Hey! I didn't have to come back.
L160033	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Got it?
L160030	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	On the side!!
L160029	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I don't know where it is!
L160026	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Takes one to know one.
L160025	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
L160024	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Self sufficient...
L160023	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Anti social?
L160022	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
L160021	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Quite a few.
L160020	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Seen a lot of islands?
L160019	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	That's what I do.
L160018	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
L160013	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Thank you, I work at it...
L160012	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Well, you sure do a good imitation.
L160011	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I'm not rich people.
L160010	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You people...rich people...
L160009	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What's that supposed to mean? You people.
L160008	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
L160007	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You don't have to be so touchy.
L160006	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
L160005	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
L160004	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
L160003	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
L160002	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know...
L160001	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What are those things?
L160000	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Jesus Christ lady...
L159999	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Noooo!
L159995	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	You hear that?
L159994	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
L159988	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	He's with them.
L159987	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	What are you people talking about?
L159986	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Unless you collected on the insurance...
L159922	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm their ride.
L159921	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Then who are you?
L159920	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I'm not a thief.
L159919	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	The thieves.
L159918	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	What other bunch?
L159915	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Who asked you to!
L159914	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I saved your life is what I did!
L159913	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Now look what you did!
L159910	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It ain't any better out there!
L159909	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	I'm not staying here!
L159891	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
L159890	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
L159889	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Shut up! You hear me!!
L159888	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Forget them...
L159887	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Hanover!! Hanover!!
L159845	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
L159844	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
L159843	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	So?
L159842	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
L159808	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	You ain't giving the orders here!
L159807	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Let's just keep going.
L160260	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
L160259	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L160258	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
L160257	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L160256	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
L160221	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
L160220	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
L160219	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
L160218	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	She's gone...
L160217	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	One whistle... Start the engine...
L160216	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Man, don't go up there...
L160214	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	How does an island sound to you?
L160213	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	And what have you come up with?
L160212	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I have been.
L160211	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
L160210	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Line it up now, nice and easy...
L160209	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
L160208	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	A little to the left...
L160207	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
L160205	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
L160204	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
L160198	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
L160197	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
L160194	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
L160193	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
L160192	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
L160191	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
L160190	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
L160189	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
L160188	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
L160055	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	That way.
L160054	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey... Which way's aft?
L159903	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
L159902	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I don't know...you got what we need?
L159901	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Finnegan, what the hell was that?
L159835	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	I'm stuck...
L159834	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	It's okay...come on...
L159828	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...look at me...
L159827	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
L159826	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...it's okay...
L159825	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
L159824	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Joey...
L159823	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
L159779	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
L159778	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	I think he knows that Joey.
L159763	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
L159762	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Me??

L159739	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
L159738	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
L159737	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	You don't give a shit about anything do you?
L159736	u4790	m319	FINNEGAN	...Jagger was here...I was here...

L159933	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Where are you going?
L159875	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	A passenger...
L159874	u4791	m319	HANOVER	You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
L159873	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Poolside?
L159872	u4791	m319	HANOVER	I mean...where is everbody?
L159870	u4791	m319	HANOVER	Where is everybody?
L159869	u4795	m319	TRILLIAN	Or maybe not.
L159860	u4796	m319	VIVO	I'm looking...
L159859	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What is it man?
L159858	u4796	m319	VIVO	I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.

L159850	u4796	m319	VIVO	Nothing.
L159849	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What was that?
L159804	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Plans don't change...
L159803	u4796	m319	VIVO	Maybe plans changed...
L159802	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
L159706	u4796	m319	VIVO	Like Mamooli's country...
L159705	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What the hell does that mean?
L159704	u4796	m319	VIVO	You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
L159703	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
L159893	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
L159892	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
L159865	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
L159864	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
L159847	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
L159846	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
L159837	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	John...
L159836	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Hey! What are you trying to pull!
L159806	u4793	m319	MULLIGAN	Shut up!
L159805	u4794	m319	PANTUCCI	Maybe it's the wrong ship.
L161698	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Wade did a little reminiscing.
L161697	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
L161292	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Wade's here.
L161291	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Yeah?
L161220	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I want this bastard brought down.
L161219	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
L161218	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
L161217	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
L161216	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	That's him.  Simon Doucet.
L161206	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I can smell it.
L161205	u4813	m321	BENNETT	No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
L161204	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Technothugs?
L161203	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
L161202	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	What'cha got, Bennett?
L161201	u4813	m321	BENNETT	Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
L161695	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
L161694	u4814	m321	CASSY	Kimberly!
L161693	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	I think he wants more than your cookies.
L161692	u4814	m321	CASSY	He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
L161691	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
L161690	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	I'd think about it.
L161689	u4814	m321	CASSY	What did you say?
L161688	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
L161892	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Put that on your political resume.
L161891	u4815	m321	DUBBS	It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161856	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
L161855	u4815	m321	DUBBS	I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
L161854	u4815	m321	DUBBS	It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161853	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Speak up.
L161846	u4815	m321	DUBBS	Your mother.
L161845	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
L161844	u4815	m321	DUBBS	Fuck you - fuck you.
L161843	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Funny guy.
L161842	u4815	m321	DUBBS	No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
L161841	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I want to ask you a few questions.
L161840	u4815	m321	DUBBS	Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
L161839	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	My man Dubbs.
L161838	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Avon Lady!
L161837	u4815	m321	DUBBS	Who is it?
L161888	u4821	m321	WADE	You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
L161887	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I don't want to hear anymore.
L161886	u4821	m321	WADE	<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
L161885	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You're crazy.
L161884	u4821	m321	WADE	You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
L161883	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	What are you talking about?
L161882	u4821	m321	WADE	That wasn't your plan, was it?
L161881	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
L161880	u4821	m321	WADE	We have to talk.
L161879	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	What is it?  I'm about to go on.
L161774	u4821	m321	WADE	Not anymore.
L161773	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
L161772	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm wasting time.
L161768	u4821	m321	WADE	Where?
L161767	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
L161598	u4821	m321	WADE	Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
L161597	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
L161596	u4821	m321	WADE	Remember my promise.
L161595	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
L161591	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	And I want Doucet.
L161590	u4821	m321	WADE	I want to stop aging.
L161589	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
L161588	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm not voting for you.
L161587	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
L161585	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I'll be alright.
L161584	u4821	m321	WADE	Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
L161583	u4821	m321	WADE	Out of the room.
L161582	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Hello Wade.
L161326	u4821	m321	WADE	I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
L161325	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You're working a partner on this.
L161324	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
L161323	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
L161318	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	When you bring in Doucet.
L161317	u4821	m321	WADE	Give it to me.
L161316	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
L161315	u4821	m321	WADE	You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
L161314	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
L161313	u4821	m321	WADE	He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
L161312	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
L161311	u4821	m321	WADE	I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
L161310	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Mug sheets.
L161309	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
L161308	u4821	m321	WADE	What's this?
L161306	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
L161305	u4821	m321	WADE	I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
L161304	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Later.  I want Doucet first.
L161303	u4821	m321	WADE	I want to see my wife and kid.
L161302	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
L161301	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm not on the force anymore.
L161300	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
L161299	u4821	m321	WADE	I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
L161298	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
L161297	u4821	m321	WADE	Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
L161296	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
L161295	u4821	m321	WADE	Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
L161890	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
L161889	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
L161412	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	What the hell are you talking about?
L161411	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Sir, your transmission's fading.
L161408	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I'm thrilled beyond belief.
L161407	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
L161406	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
L161374	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Forget it.  Stick to the program.
L161373	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
L161372	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
L161237	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
L161236	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Kill him... kill him.
L161233	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	He could be brought back.
L161232	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
L161230	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
L161229	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
L161162	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
L161161	u4822	m321	WARDEN	NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
L161160	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Just great.
L161159	u4822	m321	WARDEN	Telephone repairman.
L161158	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
L161157	u4822	m321	WARDEN	It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
L161156	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
L161894	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Shut up!  Drop it.
L161893	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	Sir---
L161615	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Keep 'em busy.
L161614	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
L161601	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	Aces.
L161600	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	How do I look?
L161599	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	You okay?
L161594	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
L161593	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	Sir, your limo's here.
L161578	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
L161577	u4816	m321	GALLAGHER	Fine.
L161576	u4818	m321	PEEBLES	Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
L161668	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Ooops, I forgot.
L161667	u4824	m321	WILLY	Not the 'T' word.
L161666	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Maybe I should put on the training whe---
L161665	u4824	m321	WILLY	Go in the house.
L161664	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Nobody's looking.
L161663	u4824	m321	WILLY	Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
L161662	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	You sure?  I can help you.
L161661	u4824	m321	WILLY	I got it.  I got it.
L161660	u4817	m321	KIMBERLY	Need help?
L161864	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	And you should be with your family.
L161863	u4821	m321	WADE	You should be in hospital.
L161783	u4821	m321	WADE	No you don't.
L161782	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	No.  I want to be with you.
L161781	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm signing off.
L161780	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You be careful.
L161779	u4821	m321	WADE	He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
L161778	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I just heard.
L161736	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
L161735	u4821	m321	WADE	What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
L161729	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Hospital food.
L161728	u4821	m321	WADE	What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
L161727	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
L161726	u4821	m321	WADE	You okay?
L161725	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
L161724	u4821	m321	WADE	So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
L161723	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
L161722	u4821	m321	WADE	Yeah.
L161658	u4821	m321	WADE	Not yet.
L161657	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	...Have you been drinking?
L161656	u4821	m321	WADE	Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
L161655	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	...What are you talking about...?
L161654	u4821	m321	WADE	You treat her nice.
L161653	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I'm here.
L161652	u4821	m321	WADE	Sanchez...?
L161632	u4821	m321	WADE	We're partners, aren't we?
L161631	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	What's this?
L161629	u4821	m321	WADE	Not too good.
L161628	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	How do I look?
L161627	u4821	m321	WADE	How ya feeling?
L161626	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Rip Van Winkle.
L161541	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
L161540	u4821	m321	WADE	Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
L161538	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Simulated one.
L161537	u4821	m321	WADE	Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
L161525	u4821	m321	WADE	Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
L161524	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Wallet, cash, I.D...
L161523	u4821	m321	WADE	What else did he get?
L161522	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
L161518	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	No, sir.
L161517	u4821	m321	WADE	You're not pregnant, are you?
L161516	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
L161515	u4821	m321	WADE	Wanna try?
L161508	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
L161507	u4821	m321	WADE	With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
L161506	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
L161505	u4821	m321	WADE	Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
L161504	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
L161500	u4821	m321	WADE	Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
L161499	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Maybe I should turn myself in.
L161497	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	That cost me two weeks' pay.
L161496	u4821	m321	WADE	Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
L161493	u4821	m321	WADE	Then find me some cigarettes.
L161492	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Yes, sir.
L161491	u4821	m321	WADE	You want to be a good detective?
L161490	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
L161489	u4821	m321	WADE	Hey, I'm eating.
L161488	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
L161487	u4821	m321	WADE	No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
L161484	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
L161483	u4821	m321	WADE	I'll have a cup of coffee?
L161474	u4821	m321	WADE	Good night.
L161473	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Good night, Wade.
L161472	u4821	m321	WADE	I'll be okay.
L161471	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You need anything else?
L161467	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Thanks.
L161466	u4821	m321	WADE	She's pretty.
L161465	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
L161464	u4821	m321	WADE	Yeah.
L161462	u4821	m321	WADE	This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
L161461	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	What's this place?
L161459	u4821	m321	WADE	Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
L161458	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
L161457	u4821	m321	WADE	Married?
L161456	u4821	m321	WADE	Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
L161455	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
L161454	u4821	m321	WADE	'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
L161453	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
L161452	u4821	m321	WADE	I was set up.
L161451	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Why?
L161450	u4821	m321	WADE	Drop it.
L161449	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
L161448	u4821	m321	WADE	GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
L161447	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
L161446	u4821	m321	WADE	You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
L161445	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	How then?
L161444	u4821	m321	WADE	You can't catch this man with a computer.
L161443	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
L161438	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Relax, let technology do the work.
L161437	u4821	m321	WADE	Hey, buddy...
L161435	u4821	m321	WADE	Trust me.  You don't want to know.
L161434	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
L161433	u4821	m321	WADE	Bacon cheeseburgers.
L161432	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
L161431	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
L161430	u4821	m321	WADE	Yes.
L161429	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Can I ask you something?
L161428	u4821	m321	WADE	Pass.
L161427	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
L161378	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	My insurance won't cover it.
L161377	u4821	m321	WADE	Wanna come?
L161376	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm not fond of television comedies.
L161375	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
L161368	u4821	m321	WADE	Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
L161367	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
L161366	u4821	m321	WADE	There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
L161365	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	I'll inform dispatch.
L161364	u4821	m321	WADE	Some things never change.
L161363	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	How do you know?
L161362	u4821	m321	WADE	They're going to rob that bank.
L161359	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Technothugs.
L161358	u4821	m321	WADE	See those guys?
L161355	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Doucet killed my partner.
L161354	u4821	m321	WADE	No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
L161353	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
L161352	u4821	m321	WADE	I have to go home, Sanchez.
L161350	u4821	m321	WADE	Lean year for role models.
L161349	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
L161348	u4821	m321	WADE	Got it.  Ejection seat?
L161347	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
L161346	u4821	m321	WADE	Does it drive itself, too?
L161344	u4821	m321	WADE	Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
L161343	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	But Sergeant...
L161342	u4821	m321	WADE	I'm ready.
L161341	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
L161340	u4821	m321	WADE	I drive.
L161339	u4821	m321	WADE	Well, that's good enough for me.
L161338	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Yes.
L161337	u4821	m321	WADE	Are you a cop?
L161336	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
L161335	u4821	m321	WADE	You my partner?
L161190	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
L161189	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	They always are.
L161188	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	But he was such a good cop.
L161187	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	He went dirty and they made an example of him.
L161186	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
L161185	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Take a look at this.
L161184	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	You never want to find out.
L161183	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	What's it mean?
L161182	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	Demolition Man.
L161181	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
L161180	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
L161179	u4819	m321	SANCHEZ	This is the guy that killed my partner.
L161178	u4820	m321	SHEPPARD	Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
L161687	u4821	m321	WADE	Remember, get the seat fixed.
L161686	u4824	m321	WILLY	Bye.  Thanks.
L161684	u4821	m321	WADE	Good to know you, Willy.
L161683	u4824	m321	WILLY	William Simpson.  I like Willy.
L161682	u4821	m321	WADE	What's your name?
L161681	u4824	m321	WILLY	I'm going to be a policeman.
L161680	u4824	m321	WILLY	My granddad was a policeman.
L161679	u4821	m321	WADE	Yes.
L161677	u4824	m321	WILLY	My mom says I'm gonna grow.
L161676	u4821	m321	WADE	Seat's too high.
L161675	u4824	m321	WILLY	Yeah.
L161674	u4821	m321	WADE	You all right?
L161716	u4821	m321	WADE	I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
L161715	u4823	m321	WHORE	Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
L161714	u4821	m321	WADE	It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
L161713	u4823	m321	WHORE	You could always take it off.
L161712	u4821	m321	WADE	This little thing says I can't.
L161711	u4823	m321	WHORE	Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
L161709	u4823	m321	WHORE	Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
L161708	u4821	m321	WADE	Hi.
L161707	u4823	m321	WHORE	Hi.
L173879	u4921	m328	BARON	You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
L173878	u4930	m328	PITER	The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
L173877	u4921	m328	BARON	It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
L173682	u4921	m328	BARON	I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
L173681	u4930	m328	PITER	He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
L173680	u4921	m328	BARON	What does Leto say, Piter?
L173679	u4930	m328	PITER	The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
L173678	u4921	m328	BARON	Piter.
L173677	u4930	m328	PITER	My Lord!
L173811	u4926	m328	KYNES	Nothing.
L173810	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	What's that you're saying?
L173792	u4926	m328	KYNES	The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
L173791	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	What happens now?
L173765	u4926	m328	KYNES	With your permission...
L173764	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	My thanks.
L173754	u4926	m328	KYNES	They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
L173753	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
L173749	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	This is my son, Paul.
L173748	u4926	m328	KYNES	I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
L173747	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
L173540	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	We are alone...
L173539	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Yes, my Lord.
L173536	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
L173535	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
L173534	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
L173533	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes?
L173532	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
L173531	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
L173530	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	We felt his presence.
L173529	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
L173561	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
L173560	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	I can assure you...
L173557	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
L173556	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
L173552	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes.
L173551	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
L173550	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
L173549	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes.
L173548	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
L173544	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
L173543	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	Many machines on Ix... new machines.
L173542	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes?... How was your journey?
L173541	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	We have just folded space from Ix...
L173784	u4926	m328	KYNES	That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
L173783	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
L173762	u4926	m328	KYNES	It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
L173761	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Yes, Sire.
L173759	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Sire!
L173758	u4926	m328	KYNES	Basically...
L173757	u4924	m328	GURNEY	The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
L173745	u4926	m328	KYNES	Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
L173744	u4924	m328	GURNEY	"I hope I made myself clear. You may call him ""The Duke,"" ""My lord,"" or ""Sire."" And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- ""Noble Born."""
L173743	u4926	m328	KYNES	So, this is Leto the Just...
L174130	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Emperor's blade.
L174129	u4924	m328	GURNEY	This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
L174102	u4929	m328	PAUL	Let him stand free!
L174101	u4924	m328	GURNEY	My Lord?
L174100	u4929	m328	PAUL	Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
L174043	u4924	m328	GURNEY	They said you were dead.  They said...
L174042	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't you trust your own eyes.
L174041	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Paul!!  Paul!!
L174040	u4929	m328	PAUL	You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
L173590	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
L173589	u4929	m328	PAUL	Things have been so serious here lately.
L173588	u4924	m328	GURNEY	If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
L173587	u4929	m328	PAUL	Would you really have drawn my blood?
L173586	u4924	m328	GURNEY	"We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the ""mood""."
L173585	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
L173584	u4929	m328	PAUL	Is this what you seek?
L173583	u4929	m328	PAUL	What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
L173581	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Not sorry enough.
L173580	u4929	m328	PAUL	I'm sorry Gurney.
L173579	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
L173578	u4929	m328	PAUL	Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
L173577	u4924	m328	GURNEY	No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
L173972	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
L173971	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
L173970	u4925	m328	JESSICA	They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
L173969	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
L173941	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
L173940	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
L173939	u4932	m328	STILGAR	I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
L173938	u4925	m328	JESSICA	No, but many consider my training valuable.
L173937	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
L173936	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
L173738	u4927	m328	MAPES	My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
L173737	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
L173736	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
L173735	u4927	m328	MAPES	Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
L173734	u4925	m328	JESSICA	It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
L173733	u4927	m328	MAPES	Do you know this my lady?
L173730	u4925	m328	JESSICA	That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
L173729	u4927	m328	MAPES	As the legend says.
L173728	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
L173727	u4927	m328	MAPES	You know the ancient tongues?
L174120	u4929	m328	PAUL	You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
L174119	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Stop him yourself.
L173935	u4929	m328	PAUL	Yes...
L173934	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Man-carved steps.
L173933	u4929	m328	PAUL	Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
L173932	u4925	m328	JESSICA	What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
L173929	u4929	m328	PAUL	I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
L173928	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Yes...
L173927	u4929	m328	PAUL	Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
L173925	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I can't... I can't.
L173924	u4929	m328	PAUL	Run!
L173921	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I'm ready.
L173920	u4929	m328	PAUL	Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
L173919	u4925	m328	JESSICA	 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
L173918	u4929	m328	PAUL	It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
L173910	u4929	m328	PAUL	You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
L173909	u4925	m328	JESSICA	He knows.
L173908	u4929	m328	PAUL	You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
L173907	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Is he....?
L173906	u4929	m328	PAUL	The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
L173905	u4929	m328	PAUL	Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
L173898	u4929	m328	PAUL	 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
L173897	u4925	m328	JESSICA	A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
L173893	u4929	m328	PAUL	The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
L173892	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Where are we do you think?
L173891	u4929	m328	PAUL	I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
L173869	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Excellent!
L173868	u4929	m328	PAUL	Remove her gag!
L173862	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
L173861	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't touch my mother...
L173637	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
L173636	u4929	m328	PAUL	What does she fear?  What about my Father?
L173635	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Your Reverence.
L173634	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
L173815	u4926	m328	KYNES	You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
L173814	u4929	m328	PAUL	Liet?
L173809	u4926	m328	KYNES	Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
L173808	u4929	m328	PAUL	Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
L173780	u4926	m328	KYNES	To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
L173779	u4929	m328	PAUL	Why do they come?
L173778	u4926	m328	KYNES	Always.
L173777	u4929	m328	PAUL	Always?
L173776	u4926	m328	KYNES	Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
L173775	u4929	m328	PAUL	Will we see a worm?
L173770	u4926	m328	KYNES	That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
L173769	u4929	m328	PAUL	No one. It... seemed the proper way.
L173768	u4926	m328	KYNES	Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
L173767	u4929	m328	PAUL	No.
L173766	u4926	m328	KYNES	You've worn a stillsuit before?
L173752	u4929	m328	PAUL	He's hiding something.
L173751	u4926	m328	KYNES	I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
L173750	u4929	m328	PAUL	Are you a Fremen?
L174076	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Long live the fighters!
L174075	u4929	m328	PAUL	Long live the fighters!
L174038	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
L174037	u4929	m328	PAUL	We surprised a band of smugglers.
L174020	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
L174019	u4929	m328	PAUL	My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
L173977	u4929	m328	PAUL	The most lethal poison in the Universe.
L173976	u4932	m328	STILGAR	The Water of Life.
L173956	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
L173955	u4929	m328	PAUL	Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
L173950	u4932	m328	STILGAR	You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
L173949	u4929	m328	PAUL	Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
L173948	u4932	m328	STILGAR	We call that one Muad'dib.
L173947	u4929	m328	PAUL	What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
L173946	u4932	m328	STILGAR	You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
L174122	u4929	m328	PAUL	SILENCE!
L174121	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	You mustn't speak of...
L174118	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Stop him, Jessica!
L174117	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
L173980	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died.
L173979	u4929	m328	PAUL	Did they try and fail?
L173978	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	... Many men have tried.
L173675	u4929	m328	PAUL	MOTHER! Tell me!
L173674	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	What can be done has been done.
L173673	u4929	m328	PAUL	Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
L173671	u4929	m328	PAUL	I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
L173670	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
L173669	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died....  Jessica!
L173668	u4929	m328	PAUL	Did they try and fail?
L173667	u4929	m328	PAUL	I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
L173666	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
L173665	u4929	m328	PAUL	Where?
L173664	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
L173663	u4929	m328	PAUL	What is it?
L173662	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
L173661	u4929	m328	PAUL	Not all of them... I know which ones will.
L173660	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
L173657	u4929	m328	PAUL	I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
L173656	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
L173655	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
L173654	u4929	m328	PAUL	THE PAIN!
L173652	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	You feel the flesh crisping?
L173651	u4929	m328	PAUL	 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
L173650	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	SILENCE... SILENCE.
L173649	u4929	m328	PAUL	It burns.
L173648	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
L173647	u4929	m328	PAUL	Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
L173646	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
L173645	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Voice again.
L173643	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Pain.
L173642	u4929	m328	PAUL	What's in the box?
L173603	u4933	m328	THUFIR	We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
L173602	u4929	m328	PAUL	I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
L173601	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
L173600	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
L173599	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
L173576	u4929	m328	PAUL	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
L173575	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
L173574	u4929	m328	PAUL	I'd know the difference.
L173573	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Those sounds could be imitated.
L173572	u4929	m328	PAUL	I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
L193448	u5107	m338	COLONEL	What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
L193447	u5106	m338	AIDE	They're...pretending to dress.
L193446	u5107	m338	COLONEL	Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
L193444	u5106	m338	AIDE	They suggested oranges.
L193443	u5107	m338	COLONEL	Good God.
L193442	u5106	m338	AIDE	The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
L193441	u5107	m338	COLONEL	Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
L193440	u5106	m338	AIDE	Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
L193439	u5107	m338	COLONEL	Did you call the Zoo?
L193524	u5109	m338	LEWIS	That primitive apes can talk.
L193523	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	Believe what?
L193522	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Nobody's going to believe it.
L193521	u5109	m338	LEWIS	My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
L193520	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
L193519	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Do you have a name?
L193518	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	We know that.
L193517	u5109	m338	LEWIS	So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
L193498	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	A display of primitive apparatus --
L193497	u5110	m338	MILO	And we can watch ...
L193496	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
L193491	u5110	m338	MILO	I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
L193490	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
L193489	u5110	m338	MILO	Zira, are you mad?
L193463	u5110	m338	MILO	And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
L193462	u5108	m338	CORNELIUS	But we saw Earth destroyed.
L193461	u5110	m338	MILO	In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
L193507	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
L193506	u5111	m338	STEVIE	With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
L193505	u5109	m338	LEWIS	We shall want a full autopsy ...
L193479	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Yes, but don't take any chances.
L193478	u5111	m338	STEVIE	They look pretty docile.
L193477	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Go easy, Stevie.
L193472	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
L193471	u5111	m338	STEVIE	What are they doing here?
L193470	u5111	m338	STEVIE	I don't believe it.
L193469	u5109	m338	LEWIS	No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
L193468	u5111	m338	STEVIE	With food?
L193467	u5109	m338	LEWIS	There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
L193466	u5111	m338	STEVIE	What, Lewis?
L193529	u5112	m338	ZIRA	I like you.
L193528	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Please
L193527	u5112	m338	ZIRA	May I say something personal?
L193526	u5109	m338	LEWIS	I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
L193525	u5112	m338	ZIRA	Primitive?
L193516	u5112	m338	ZIRA	I'm a psychiatrist.
L193515	u5109	m338	LEWIS	Humans?
L193514	u5112	m338	ZIRA	I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
L193513	u5109	m338	LEWIS	I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
L193512	u5112	m338	ZIRA	He's a gorilla.
L193511	u5109	m338	LEWIS	But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
L194034	u5116	m339	MALLOY	C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
L194033	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
L193646	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
L193645	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	His reactor's starting to overheat.
L193614	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
L193613	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
L193612	u5116	m339	MALLOY	L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
L193601	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
L193600	u5116	m339	MALLOY	The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
L193574	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
L193573	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
L193559	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
L193558	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
L193557	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L193850	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Yes...
L193849	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
L193848	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	I tried...
L193847	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
L193846	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Cuervo...?
L193795	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Go on now. Do as I say.
L193794	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Ooww!
L193793	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
L193792	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
L193791	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
L193790	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You never heard of Snake Plissken?
L193789	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Who's that?
L193992	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo, look out behind you!
L193991	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
L193990	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He's... near.
L193989	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where's Plissken?
L193988	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	It's so good to see you again.
L193987	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	What?
L193986	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh Cuervo...
L193985	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where?
L193984	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I thought he was, but he came back.
L193983	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You told me he was dead.
L193982	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
L193842	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
L193841	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Give it.
L193840	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
L193839	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Give it to me.
L193838	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
L193837	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where is he?
L193778	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	We'll see.
L193777	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
L193962	u5115	m339	HERSHE	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
L193961	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
L193954	u5115	m339	HERSHE	You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
L193953	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Shit.
L193943	u5122	m339	SPINAL	I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
L193942	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
L193926	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
L193925	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
L193919	u5115	m339	HERSHE	We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
L193918	u5122	m339	SPINAL	I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
L194014	u5115	m339	HERSHE	My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
L194013	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
L194012	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Can you land?
L194011	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
L193995	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Somebody get off!
L193994	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
L193969	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
L193968	u5115	m339	HERSHE	See you in hell, Snake.
L193952	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I don't know yet.
L193951	u5115	m339	HERSHE	No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
L193950	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
L193949	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I don't know, sounds thin to me.
L193937	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
L193936	u5115	m339	HERSHE	So what's the deal, gorgeous?
L193924	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Say goodnight, Carjack.
L193923	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Dream on, blue eye.
L193922	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
L193921	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I see your point. What's the favor?
L193920	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm already dead.
L193916	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I got a new deal for you.
L193915	u5115	m339	HERSHE	All right, so I made another deal.
L193914	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't lie to me.
L193913	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
L193908	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Not anymore.
L193907	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
L193906	u5115	m339	HERSHE	What's in it for me?
L193905	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I need a favor.
L194041	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The name's Plissken.
L194040	u5116	m339	MALLOY	You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
L194039	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Got a smoke?
L194005	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah, I got it.
L194004	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
L193651	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	It's history. I gotta go.
L193650	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
L193649	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm here.
L193648	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken...?
L193641	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
L193640	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	75% power.
L193639	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
L193638	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Locked.
L193637	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Lock fuel rods.
L193636	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	She's in the green.
L193631	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Good.
L193630	u5116	m339	MALLOY	No.
L193629	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Not you?
L193628	u5116	m339	MALLOY	A medical team will be standing by.
L193627	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
L193626	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
L193625	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
L193624	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
L193623	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where do I put ashore?
L193621	u5116	m339	MALLOY	All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
L193620	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So what does this thing do?
L193619	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
L193618	u5116	m339	MALLOY	There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
L193617	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Defense against what?
L193616	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
L193615	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'll need to know more about this thing.
L193607	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Call me Snake.
L193606	u5116	m339	MALLOY	I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
L193605	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get this crap out of me.
L193599	u5116	m339	MALLOY	You don't understand. It's already in you.
L193598	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
L193597	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Having second thoughts?
L193596	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
L193585	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
L193584	u5116	m339	MALLOY	That's the deal.
L193583	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
L193582	u5116	m339	MALLOY	That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
L193581	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
L193580	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Top secret. Only on a need to know.
L193579	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What's the little black box do?
L193578	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Shut up, Plissken.
L193562	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
L193561	u5116	m339	MALLOY	How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
L194036	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
L194035	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
L193897	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
L193896	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Does he know how to activate it?
L193895	u5116	m339	MALLOY	The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
L193858	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	So where's Plissken?
L193857	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Getting ready to invade.
L193589	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
L193588	u5116	m339	MALLOY	It's the President, for Christ's sake!
L193975	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
L193974	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Is that what I think it is?
L193966	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	If he lets you get close enough.
L193965	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
L193964	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah, kinda.
L193963	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
L193960	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't like it, don't come.
L193959	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I don't know about this thing.
L193948	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
L193947	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Aw, come on, Snake.
L193941	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	We'll see.
L193940	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Me too?
L193935	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
L193934	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How do you know all this?
L193890	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
L193889	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Cease fire with the bullshit.
L193888	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
L193887	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Later.
L193886	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
L193885	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
L193823	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
L193822	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Not yet.
L193820	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
L193819	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where are they going?
L193771	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right over there.
L193770	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where is it?
L193769	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
L193768	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I said pull over.
L193767	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	No way.
L193766	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Stop the damn car.
L193765	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
L193764	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Delgado?
L193763	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
L193686	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
L193685	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Location.
L193684	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
L193683	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where are they?
L193681	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
L193680	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where'd they go?
L193679	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
L193742	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
L193741	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
L193740	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
L193726	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Which way?
L193725	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
L193724	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Looking to get out.
L193723	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	What're you doing in here?
L193874	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
L193873	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193872	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
L193870	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
L193869	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where?
L193868	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
L193867	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
L193866	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
L193657	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Down that way.
L193656	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
L193655	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
L193759	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193758	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Run, Snake...They're coming.
L193757	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
L193756	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Find Cuervo Jones.
L193755	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	What are you gonna do in Venice?
L193754	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
L193753	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
L193752	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	The freeway.
L193751	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What the hell is this?
L193750	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
L193738	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
L193737	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
L193722	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
L193721	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Snake - what is it?
L193719	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Sewers. Come on.
L193718	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How do we get out of here?
L193716	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The what?
L193715	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
L193713	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
L193712	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
L193710	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Like hell I do.
L193709	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	You need help.
L193708	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't follow me.
L193702	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
L193701	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193700	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Oh no, it's the Doctor.
L193699	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	No screamin' shit.
L193698	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
L193697	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What are they?
L193694	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
L193693	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Are you crazy?
L193692	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
L194029	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Give me the prototype.
L194028	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where's the anti-toxin...?
L194003	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Thank God.
L194002	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
L193594	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
L193593	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	You're running out of time.
L193592	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Well, I'll think it over.
L193591	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
L193590	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
L193946	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
L193945	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
L193944	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
L193939	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah.
L193938	u5122	m339	SPINAL	All of us?
L193912	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
L193911	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
L193910	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
L193666	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Who ain't?
L193665	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm looking for somebody.
L193664	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Hey, what's going down, Snake?
L201015	u5191	m343	WAXY	He hit a guard.
L201014	u5177	m343	ARCHER	What did he do?
L201013	u5191	m343	WAXY	They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
L201012	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You mean if I get sick?
L201011	u5191	m343	WAXY	"Not unless you're sent to the ""Clinic."""
L201010	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
L200849	u5191	m343	WAXY	You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
L200848	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Do I look wasted -- asshole?
L200847	u5191	m343	WAXY	They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
L200846	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
L200777	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
L200776	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
L200775	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
L200774	u5177	m343	ARCHER	He's lying.
L200740	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
L200739	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
L200738	u5177	m343	ARCHER	... Thanks.
L200737	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	"I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say ""thanks""?"
L200736	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
L200735	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Fine work, Jon.
L201130	u5187	m343	SASHA	You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
L201129	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
L201128	u5187	m343	SASHA	Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
L201127	u5177	m343	ARCHER	How old is he?
L201126	u5187	m343	SASHA	Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
L201121	u5187	m343	SASHA	Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
L201120	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Nice-looking kid.
L201119	u5187	m343	SASHA	Should be.  It's yours.
L201118	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Perfect fit.
L201114	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I'm not the same person you remember.
L201113	u5187	m343	SASHA	Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
L201112	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
L201111	u5187	m343	SASHA	Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
L201110	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
L201109	u5187	m343	SASHA	My place.
L201108	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Where am I?
L201093	u5187	m343	SASHA	The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
L201092	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Drive.
L201091	u5187	m343	SASHA	Jesus Christ, Castor.
L201090	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Yeah -- me.
L201089	u5187	m343	SASHA	Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
L201151	u5180	m343	DIETRICH	Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
L201150	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Or reactivated the first one.
L201149	u5180	m343	DIETRICH	He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
L201148	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Why would he need more?
L201147	u5180	m343	DIETRICH	Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
L201146	u5177	m343	ARCHER	And this thing can grow it?
L200893	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Thanks?  I guess they really did fuck you up.
L200892	u5177	m343	ARCHER	For being one helluva guy.
L200891	u5186	m343	POLLUX	For what?
L200890	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Thanks, Pollux.
L200888	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
L200887	u5186	m343	POLLUX	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
L200886	u5177	m343	ARCHER	That's not the worst part.
L200883	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Only one you've never broken.
L200882	u5177	m343	ARCHER	And I bet I've kept that promise ...
L200881	u5186	m343	POLLUX	After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
L200880	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Uh -- to kill the doctors?
L200879	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
L200878	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
L200876	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Like ...
L200875	u5186	m343	POLLUX	A few blanks?  Like what?
L200874	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
L200873	u5186	m343	POLLUX	You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
L200872	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
L200871	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Let me have a look.
L200870	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
L200869	u5186	m343	POLLUX	You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
L200868	u5177	m343	ARCHER	What do you mean?
L200867	u5186	m343	POLLUX	So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
L200866	u5177	m343	ARCHER	So?
L200865	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Shut up.
L200864	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Pollux ...
L200859	u5177	m343	ARCHER	They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
L200858	u5186	m343	POLLUX	You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
L200857	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Hey, bro ...
L201266	u5182	m343	EVE	Damn right.
L201265	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Would it?
L201264	u5182	m343	EVE	I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
L201259	u5177	m343	ARCHER	That's what they always say.
L201258	u5182	m343	EVE	No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
L201257	u5177	m343	ARCHER	How is he?
L201204	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Eve ...
L201203	u5182	m343	EVE	Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
L201202	u5177	m343	ARCHER	"I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is ""me."" We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off."
L201201	u5182	m343	EVE	Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
L201200	u5177	m343	ARCHER	The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
L201199	u5182	m343	EVE	Jon, what is it?
L201198	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
L201197	u5182	m343	EVE	-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
L201196	u5177	m343	ARCHER	He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
L201195	u5182	m343	EVE	What do you mean?
L201194	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
L201193	u5182	m343	EVE	He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
L201191	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
L201190	u5182	m343	EVE	Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
L201188	u5182	m343	EVE	Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
L201187	u5177	m343	ARCHER	What more proof do you need?
L201186	u5182	m343	EVE	I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
L201185	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
L201184	u5182	m343	EVE	I took it from my fake husband.
L201171	u5177	m343	ARCHER	An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
L201170	u5182	m343	EVE	How did he expect to do that?
L201169	u5177	m343	ARCHER	-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
L201168	u5182	m343	EVE	I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
L201086	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Don't hang up ...
L201085	u5182	m343	EVE	Whoever you are, don't call again.
L201084	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
L201083	u5182	m343	EVE	Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
L201082	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
L201081	u5182	m343	EVE	Who is this?
L201079	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
L201078	u5182	m343	EVE	Is someone there?
L200809	u5182	m343	EVE	You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
L200808	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
L200807	u5182	m343	EVE	You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
L200806	u5177	m343	ARCHER	One last time.  It's important ...
L200805	u5182	m343	EVE	What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
L200803	u5182	m343	EVE	And you wouldn't be.
L200802	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
L200801	u5182	m343	EVE	I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
L200800	u5177	m343	ARCHER	How come?
L200799	u5182	m343	EVE	No.
L200798	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Were you there to catch me?
L200797	u5182	m343	EVE	Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
L200796	u5177	m343	ARCHER	So you had a nightmare.
L200795	u5182	m343	EVE	Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
L200794	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Must've been after we got engaged.
L200793	u5182	m343	EVE	We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
L200792	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Something good?
L200791	u5182	m343	EVE	... I was dreaming ...
L200758	u5182	m343	EVE	So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
L200757	u5177	m343	ARCHER	It's important.
L200756	u5182	m343	EVE	I'm late for surgery.
L200755	u5177	m343	ARCHER	We need to talk.
L200754	u5182	m343	EVE	Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
L200753	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Is that what you think?
L200752	u5182	m343	EVE	"She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying ""I love you."""
L200751	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
L200750	u5182	m343	EVE	Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
L200833	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Just make sure you're there.  On time.
L200832	u5188	m343	TITO	This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
L200831	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
L200830	u5188	m343	TITO	Now what?
L200818	u5188	m343	TITO	Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
L200817	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
L200816	u5188	m343	TITO	You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
L200815	u5177	m343	ARCHER	She doesn't know -- and she never will.
L200814	u5188	m343	TITO	Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
L200783	u5188	m343	TITO	The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
L200782	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Which ear was it?
L200780	u5177	m343	ARCHER	He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
L200779	u5188	m343	TITO	We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
L200771	u5188	m343	TITO	Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
L200770	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Go on.
L200769	u5188	m343	TITO	Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
L200768	u5177	m343	ARCHER	How's Loomis?
L200714	u5181	m343	DR. GARDNER	You said it, Jon, not me.
L200713	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
L200712	u5181	m343	DR. GARDNER	I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
L200711	u5177	m343	ARCHER	One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
L200710	u5181	m343	DR. GARDNER	You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
L200709	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
L200708	u5181	m343	DR. GARDNER	You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
L200707	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
L200706	u5181	m343	DR. GARDNER	"How is the ""date night"" idea going over with Eve?"
L201243	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Shoot him!
L201242	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Jamie ...
L201239	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Not if I kill you first ...
L201238	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
L201237	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Five seconds.
L201236	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
L201234	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
L201233	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What -- what are you doing?
L201137	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
L201136	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Stay away from my family!
L200905	u5179	m343	CASTOR	"You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean ""make love to."""
L200904	u5177	m343	ARCHER	What are you going to do!
L200903	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
L200902	u5177	m343	ARCHER	What are you going to do, Castor?
L200901	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
L200900	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You killed them?
L200899	u5179	m343	CASTOR	"I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was ""titanically remote.""  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here."
L200898	u5177	m343	ARCHER	It can't be.  It's impossible.
L200897	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Not anymore.
L200896	u5177	m343	ARCHER	-- Castor?
L200732	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Don't count on it.
L200731	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
L200730	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
L200729	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Mention my family once more and you're dead.
L200728	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
L200727	u5177	m343	ARCHER	You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
L200726	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
L200725	u5177	m343	ARCHER	"And how much will your ""fun"" net you this time?"
L200724	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
L200913	u5189	m343	WALTON	Or what?  You'll have me fired?
L200912	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
L200911	u5189	m343	WALTON	Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
L200910	u5177	m343	ARCHER	Pollux is -- what?
L200909	u5189	m343	WALTON	You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
L200855	u5177	m343	ARCHER	I'm going to have you fired.
L200854	u5189	m343	WALTON	You'll what?
L200843	u5189	m343	WALTON	So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
L200842	u5177	m343	ARCHER	They're too tight.
L201246	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
L201245	u5178	m343	BUZZ	What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
L201244	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
L201124	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
L201123	u5178	m343	BUZZ	What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
L201122	u5179	m343	CASTOR	We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
L201069	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
L201068	u5178	m343	BUZZ	SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
L201223	u5183	m343	JAMIE	Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
L201222	u5179	m343	CASTOR	There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
L201104	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I mean like protection.
L201103	u5183	m343	JAMIE	You mean like ... condoms?
L201102	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
L201101	u5183	m343	JAMIE	You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
L201100	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What are you -- stupid?
L200984	u5183	m343	JAMIE	Like you know anything about it.
L200983	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
L200942	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
L200941	u5183	m343	JAMIE	When did you start smoking?
L200940	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I won't tell mom if you don't.
L200939	u5183	m343	JAMIE	Clarissa left those here.
L200937	u5183	m343	JAMIE	Janie?
L200936	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
L200968	u5184	m343	KIMBERLY	The Admiral?
L200967	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Get rid of them.
L200966	u5184	m343	KIMBERLY	You've got someone in your office.
L200965	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
L200964	u5184	m343	KIMBERLY	You always call me Miss Brewster.
L200963	u5179	m343	CASTOR	That's your name, isn't it?
L200962	u5184	m343	KIMBERLY	Kim?
L200961	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Well, I saw you -- Kim.
L200960	u5184	m343	KIMBERLY	Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
L201248	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You can't blame me for trying.
L201247	u5190	m343	WANDA	You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
L201166	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
L201165	u5190	m343	WANDA	It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
L201164	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What?
L201163	u5190	m343	WANDA	Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
L201162	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
L201161	u5190	m343	WANDA	Commander, what are you doing here?
L201145	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
L201144	u5190	m343	WANDA	What happened?
L201067	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
L201066	u5190	m343	WANDA	Castor's escaped!
L201065	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What happened?
L201064	u5190	m343	WANDA	You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
L201072	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
L201071	u5179	m343	CASTOR	A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
L201070	u5186	m343	POLLUX	What about me?
L201063	u5186	m343	POLLUX	No problem.
L201062	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You'll need to recultivate that virus.
L201061	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
L201060	u5179	m343	CASTOR	All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
L201059	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
L201058	u5179	m343	CASTOR	We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
L201055	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
L201054	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
L201053	u5179	m343	CASTOR	There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
L201052	u5186	m343	POLLUX	I'm just having some fun.
L201051	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
L201050	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
L201049	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
L201048	u5186	m343	POLLUX	Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
L200950	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
L200949	u5186	m343	POLLUX	No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
L200948	u5179	m343	CASTOR	-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
L200946	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
L200945	u5186	m343	POLLUX	I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
L200944	u5179	m343	CASTOR	"Business first.  I went into the ""Warrants"" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll."
L200943	u5186	m343	POLLUX	You merciless bastard!
L201156	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
L201155	u5179	m343	CASTOR	No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
L201154	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
L201153	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
L201152	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
L200981	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
L200980	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
L200979	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	You'd have to start immediately.
L200978	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
L200977	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
L200976	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What's that?
L200975	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
L200974	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Just following your example.
L200973	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
L200972	u5179	m343	CASTOR	You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
L200970	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Normally, I would.  But today ...
L200969	u5185	m343	LAZARRO	Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
L201220	u5182	m343	EVE	Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
L201219	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Back then -- who wasn't?
L201218	u5182	m343	EVE	Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
L201214	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
L201213	u5182	m343	EVE	I'm going to the powder room.
L201212	u5182	m343	EVE	Good.  Because I'm fed up.
L201211	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I'll deal with her later.
L201210	u5182	m343	EVE	That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
L201209	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Where's Jamie?
L201181	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
L201180	u5182	m343	EVE	-- Yes.
L201179	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
L201178	u5182	m343	EVE	Nothing.
L201176	u5182	m343	EVE	-- Studying.
L201175	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What are you doing?
L201041	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
L201040	u5182	m343	EVE	Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
L201039	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Oh, that Karl.
L201038	u5182	m343	EVE	Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
L201037	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Great.
L201036	u5182	m343	EVE	I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
L201035	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
L201034	u5182	m343	EVE	The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
L201033	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
L201032	u5182	m343	EVE	Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
L201031	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What's on your mind?
L201009	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Call me spontaneous.
L201008	u5182	m343	EVE	You're wearing your suit --
L201007	u5179	m343	CASTOR	So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
L201006	u5182	m343	EVE	... That's great.
L201005	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
L201004	u5182	m343	EVE	-- what?
L201003	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
L201002	u5182	m343	EVE	You always say that -- then you leave.
L201001	u5179	m343	CASTOR	I'm not going anywhere.
L201000	u5182	m343	EVE	Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
L200999	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Gone?
L200998	u5182	m343	EVE	So -- how long will you be gone this time?
L200996	u5182	m343	EVE	You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
L200995	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
L200994	u5182	m343	EVE	I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
L200993	u5179	m343	CASTOR	They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
L200992	u5182	m343	EVE	Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
L200990	u5182	m343	EVE	-- I've got to study.
L200989	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
L200932	u5182	m343	EVE	No.
L200931	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
L200930	u5182	m343	EVE	What is with you tonight?
L200929	u5179	m343	CASTOR	Have fun at work.
L200928	u5182	m343	EVE	Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
L200927	u5179	m343	CASTOR	The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
L200926	u5182	m343	EVE	The hospital.
L200925	u5179	m343	CASTOR	It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
L200924	u5182	m343	EVE	As much as ever.  Nothing.
L200923	u5179	m343	CASTOR	What do you know about it?
L200922	u5182	m343	EVE	"What happened to your big ""assignment""?"
L204598	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
L204597	u5219	m345	THE THING	I mean...
L204596	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L204595	u5219	m345	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
L204593	u5219	m345	THE THING	This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
L204592	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L204591	u5219	m345	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L204797	u5211	m345	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L204796	u5210	m345	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L204590	u5210	m345	ALICIA	My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L204589	u5211	m345	BEN	Those yours too?
L204588	u5211	m345	BEN	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
L204587	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L204586	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L204585	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
L204584	u5211	m345	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L204457	u5211	m345	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L204456	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L204453	u5211	m345	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L204452	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L204794	u5211	m345	BEN	Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
L204793	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
L204784	u5211	m345	BEN	Got it, teach.
L204783	u5216	m345	REED	Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
L204650	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L204649	u5211	m345	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L204647	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
L204646	u5216	m345	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L204645	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
L204644	u5216	m345	REED	Ben --
L204525	u5216	m345	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L204524	u5211	m345	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L204363	u5216	m345	REED	O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
L204362	u5211	m345	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L204361	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L204360	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L204359	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
L204343	u5216	m345	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L204342	u5211	m345	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L204308	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L204307	u5216	m345	REED	We had a tough year.
L204263	u5211	m345	BEN	Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
L204262	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  Are you okay?
L204261	u5211	m345	BEN	What the --!
L204165	u5211	m345	BEN	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
L204164	u5216	m345	REED	Are you alright?
L204137	u5211	m345	BEN	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
L204136	u5216	m345	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L204135	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L204134	u5216	m345	REED	What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
L204133	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L204132	u5216	m345	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L204131	u5211	m345	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L204129	u5216	m345	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L204128	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
L204127	u5216	m345	REED	I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L204125	u5211	m345	BEN	Solid.
L204124	u5216	m345	REED	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L204123	u5211	m345	BEN	How long was I out?
L204059	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
L204058	u5211	m345	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L204025	u5211	m345	BEN	<u>Should</u>?
L204024	u5216	m345	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L204005	u5216	m345	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L204004	u5211	m345	BEN	This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
L204003	u5216	m345	REED	He's made a few changes.
L204002	u5211	m345	BEN	Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
L203982	u5211	m345	BEN	This makes five.
L203981	u5216	m345	REED	I had it at four.
L203980	u5211	m345	BEN	Five times.
L203979	u5216	m345	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203978	u5216	m345	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203977	u5211	m345	BEN	They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
L203976	u5216	m345	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203975	u5211	m345	BEN	No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203974	u5216	m345	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203973	u5211	m345	BEN	Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
L203961	u5211	m345	BEN	I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
L203960	u5216	m345	REED	We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
L203959	u5211	m345	BEN	Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
L203958	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203957	u5211	m345	BEN	He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203948	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
L203947	u5211	m345	BEN	What about his first born?
L203933	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
L203932	u5211	m345	BEN	I can't take this.
L203917	u5211	m345	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203916	u5216	m345	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203915	u5216	m345	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203914	u5211	m345	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L204807	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L204806	u5211	m345	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L204724	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
L204723	u5211	m345	BEN	The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L204661	u5211	m345	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L204660	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
L204091	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L204090	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L204089	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L204088	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
L204087	u5211	m345	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L204086	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
L204085	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed? ... Sue?
L204084	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L204083	u5211	m345	BEN	Where...where am I?
L204039	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L204038	u5211	m345	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L204037	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L204036	u5211	m345	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L204035	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L204034	u5211	m345	BEN	'Course not.  Strictly business.
L204033	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L204017	u5211	m345	BEN	Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
L204016	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L204011	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L204010	u5211	m345	BEN	What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L204441	u5211	m345	BEN	I already got it.  Everything I want.
L204440	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L204225	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
L204224	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
L204223	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L204222	u5211	m345	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L204221	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Ben?
L204219	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
L204218	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
L204009	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L204008	u5211	m345	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L204007	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L204006	u5211	m345	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L204694	u5211	m345	BEN	And you can?  Power it up?
L204693	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L204692	u5220	m345	VICTOR	He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
L204691	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L204690	u5220	m345	VICTOR	To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
L204689	u5211	m345	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L204686	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
L204685	u5211	m345	BEN	What is this?  Where's Reed?
L204684	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L204634	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
L204633	u5211	m345	BEN	About me?  How sweet.
L204632	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L204631	u5211	m345	BEN	What are <u>you</u> doing here?
L204726	u5211	m345	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L204725	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>Where is Reed</u>?
L204543	u5218	m345	SUE	No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L204542	u5211	m345	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L204541	u5218	m345	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L204540	u5211	m345	BEN	It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
L204539	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L204500	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
L204499	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, he did.
L204498	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't.
L204396	u5211	m345	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L204395	u5218	m345	SUE	The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
L204394	u5211	m345	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L204345	u5211	m345	BEN	Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
L204344	u5218	m345	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L204160	u5211	m345	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L204159	u5218	m345	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L204023	u5211	m345	BEN	Is it safe?
L204022	u5218	m345	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203986	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor did.
L203985	u5211	m345	BEN	I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
L203968	u5218	m345	SUE	I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203967	u5211	m345	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L204414	u5220	m345	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L204413	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
L204411	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
L204410	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What?
L204409	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
L204408	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L204407	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L204406	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L204405	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
L204404	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And they're changing into...
L204403	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
L204778	u5216	m345	REED	<u>Now</u>.
L204777	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	But all these people...
L204776	u5216	m345	REED	Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
L204535	u5216	m345	REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
L204534	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
L204533	u5216	m345	REED	You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
L204445	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L204444	u5216	m345	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L204398	u5216	m345	REED	They're not costumes.
L204397	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
L204367	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L204366	u5216	m345	REED	What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L204365	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
L204364	u5216	m345	REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
L204357	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
L204356	u5216	m345	REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
L204351	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I can go hotter!
L204350	u5216	m345	REED	Back it down, Johnny!
L204321	u5216	m345	REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
L204320	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
L204319	u5216	m345	REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
L204310	u5216	m345	REED	Oh, it is.
L204309	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
L204288	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
L204287	u5216	m345	REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
L204255	u5216	m345	REED	You've been working out.
L204254	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
L204199	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, are you there?
L204198	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
L204190	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
L204189	u5216	m345	REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
L204188	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
L204081	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Ben!  Ben!
L204080	u5216	m345	REED	He's not responsive --
L204074	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What about you?
L204073	u5216	m345	REED	Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
L204146	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
L204145	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Not this again --
L204144	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
L204143	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.
L204142	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
L204141	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	Stay right.  Left is trouble.
L204140	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L204122	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L204121	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L204120	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L204119	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L204118	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	So are you!
L204117	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
L204109	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --"
L204108	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
L204736	u5218	m345	SUE	But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
L204735	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
L204734	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing --
L204721	u5218	m345	SUE	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
L204720	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L204668	u5218	m345	SUE	As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
L204667	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L204666	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
L204665	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L204664	u5218	m345	SUE	"Is that what you call it?  ""<i>Real</i>""?"
L204663	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
L204662	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
L204531	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!
L204530	u5218	m345	SUE	You two need a time-out.
L204523	u5218	m345	SUE	"You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
L204522	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L204519	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Dude.  That's my sister.
L204518	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm driving.
L204506	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>Girl</u>...?!
L204505	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
L204355	u5218	m345	SUE	That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
L204354	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L204353	u5218	m345	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L204352	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
L204318	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L204317	u5218	m345	SUE	Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
L204316	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L204205	u5218	m345	SUE	I think that thing is Ben.
L204204	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What is that <i>thing</i>?
L204197	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	"Okay, ""mom."""
L204196	u5218	m345	SUE	Stop it.
L204195	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny.
L204194	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
L204192	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
L204191	u5218	m345	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203988	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203987	u5218	m345	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L204231	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
L204230	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Front page?
L204229	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L204228	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
L204158	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not <u>mine</u>."""
L204157	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
L204156	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
L204155	u5215	m345	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L204154	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
L204153	u5215	m345	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L204152	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L204151	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L204150	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L204149	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L204148	u5220	m345	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L204021	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
L204020	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203999	u5220	m345	VICTOR	History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203998	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203997	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
L203996	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203995	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203994	u5215	m345	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203956	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203955	u5215	m345	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203954	u5220	m345	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L204566	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
L204565	u5216	m345	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L204564	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L204563	u5216	m345	REED	What are you doing here?
L204338	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
L204337	u5216	m345	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L204336	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
L204335	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L204334	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
L204331	u5216	m345	REED	Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L204330	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L204211	u5216	m345	REED	He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
L204210	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Ben</u> did this?
L204209	u5216	m345	REED	Ben did this.
L204208	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
L204067	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L204066	u5216	m345	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L204063	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L204062	u5216	m345	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L204056	u5220	m345	VICTOR	So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
L204055	u5216	m345	REED	Ben's still out there --
L204054	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
L204053	u5216	m345	REED	We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
L204032	u5216	m345	REED	Sure.
L204031	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203953	u5216	m345	REED	Hilarious.
L203952	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203946	u5220	m345	VICTOR	The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
L203945	u5216	m345	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203942	u5216	m345	REED	Not at all.
L203941	u5220	m345	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203929	u5216	m345	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
L203928	u5220	m345	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L204800	u5218	m345	SUE	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
L204799	u5216	m345	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L204781	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204780	u5216	m345	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L204675	u5218	m345	SUE	You <u>need</u> a doctor.
L204674	u5216	m345	REED	The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
L204673	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L204672	u5216	m345	REED	I can...make it work.
L204622	u5218	m345	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L204621	u5216	m345	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L204620	u5218	m345	SUE	When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L204619	u5218	m345	SUE	I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
L204618	u5216	m345	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L204615	u5218	m345	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L204614	u5216	m345	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L204613	u5218	m345	SUE	Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L204612	u5216	m345	REED	You <u>were</u>?
L204611	u5218	m345	SUE	Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
L204610	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
L204609	u5216	m345	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L204578	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L204577	u5218	m345	SUE	Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
L204576	u5216	m345	REED	Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
L204575	u5218	m345	SUE	Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
L204574	u5216	m345	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L204573	u5218	m345	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L204492	u5216	m345	REED	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
L204491	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
L204426	u5216	m345	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
L204425	u5218	m345	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
L204424	u5216	m345	REED	Of course.  Of course.
L204423	u5218	m345	SUE	But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
L204422	u5216	m345	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L204421	u5218	m345	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L204420	u5216	m345	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L204419	u5216	m345	REED	The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L204418	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204389	u5218	m345	SUE	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L204388	u5216	m345	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L204387	u5218	m345	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L204386	u5216	m345	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L204385	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L204384	u5216	m345	REED	No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
L204383	u5218	m345	SUE	Are you kidding?
L204382	u5216	m345	REED	I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
L204381	u5216	m345	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L204380	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L204378	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204377	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
L204376	u5218	m345	SUE	Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
L204375	u5216	m345	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L204374	u5218	m345	SUE	Excuse me?
L204373	u5216	m345	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L204369	u5218	m345	SUE	What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L204368	u5216	m345	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L204315	u5218	m345	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L204314	u5216	m345	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L204313	u5218	m345	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L204253	u5218	m345	SUE	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
L204252	u5216	m345	REED	Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
L204250	u5216	m345	REED	We need to get past them.
L204249	u5218	m345	SUE	What?
L204187	u5216	m345	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
L204186	u5218	m345	SUE	It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L204184	u5216	m345	REED	Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
L204183	u5218	m345	SUE	What?  What do you mean you --
L204182	u5216	m345	REED	Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
L204177	u5218	m345	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L204176	u5216	m345	REED	For science.
L204175	u5216	m345	REED	Passion.
L204174	u5218	m345	SUE	Which was?
L204173	u5216	m345	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L204172	u5218	m345	SUE	You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
L204170	u5218	m345	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L204169	u5216	m345	REED	That's good.  That's uh...good.
L204168	u5218	m345	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L204167	u5216	m345	REED	Feeling better?
L203991	u5218	m345	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203990	u5216	m345	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
L203972	u5218	m345	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
L203971	u5216	m345	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203970	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been changed.
L203969	u5216	m345	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203966	u5218	m345	SUE	Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
L203965	u5216	m345	REED	Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203964	u5218	m345	SUE	I was talking about us.  Working together.
L203963	u5216	m345	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203940	u5218	m345	SUE	Never better.
L203939	u5216	m345	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L204472	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
L204471	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L204470	u5218	m345	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L204469	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
L204468	u5218	m345	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
L204467	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L204466	u5218	m345	SUE	He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L204464	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Susan.  What are you doing?
L204463	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L204462	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
L204461	u5218	m345	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L204326	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
L204325	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L204324	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
L204323	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L204214	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just <u>find</u> him.
L204213	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L204207	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L204206	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What's going on?
L204070	u5218	m345	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L204069	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L204068	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204050	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L204049	u5218	m345	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L204048	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L204047	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L204042	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L204041	u5218	m345	SUE	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
L204040	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203936	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203935	u5218	m345	SUE	It's just business.
L204641	u5219	m345	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L204640	u5220	m345	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L204639	u5219	m345	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L204638	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L204637	u5219	m345	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L204636	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L204635	u5219	m345	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L205491	u5221	m346	CARTER	Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
L205490	u5230	m346	REID	I'd hold that off awhile.
L205489	u5221	m346	CARTER	Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
L205464	u5230	m346	REID	Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
L205463	u5221	m346	CARTER	If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
L205462	u5230	m346	REID	What're you getting at?
L205461	u5221	m346	CARTER	That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
L205460	u5230	m346	REID	What is it?
L205432	u5221	m346	CARTER	It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
L205431	u5230	m346	REID	Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
L205197	u5221	m346	CARTER	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
L205196	u5230	m346	REID	I told you to cut down on the sugar.
L205194	u5221	m346	CARTER	Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
L205193	u5230	m346	REID	It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
L205192	u5221	m346	CARTER	Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
L205133	u5230	m346	REID	They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
L205132	u5221	m346	CARTER	They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
L205102	u5221	m346	CARTER	Message to Proteus.
L205101	u5230	m346	REID	<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
L205098	u5230	m346	REID	Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
L205097	u5221	m346	CARTER	What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
L205096	u5230	m346	REID	That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
L205095	u5221	m346	CARTER	At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
L205094	u5230	m346	REID	In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
L205093	u5221	m346	CARTER	I know that. But what's the maximum?
L205092	u5230	m346	REID	The less time, the better.
L205091	u5221	m346	CARTER	Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
L205088	u5221	m346	CARTER	Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
L205087	u5230	m346	REID	But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
L205086	u5221	m346	CARTER	We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
L205085	u5221	m346	CARTER	No...
L205084	u5230	m346	REID	But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
L205064	u5230	m346	REID	Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
L205063	u5221	m346	CARTER	That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
L205062	u5230	m346	REID	They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
L205013	u5221	m346	CARTER	Phase Two.
L205012	u5230	m346	REID	Okay to proceed.
L204949	u5230	m346	REID	Medical's ready.
L204948	u5221	m346	CARTER	Where do we stand?
L204931	u5221	m346	CARTER	We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
L204930	u5230	m346	REID	Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
L204908	u5230	m346	REID	Here's the overall Target Area...
L204907	u5221	m346	CARTER	Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
L205487	u5221	m346	CARTER	Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
L205486	u5224	m346	GRANT	Yes, we'd like to get moving.
L205479	u5221	m346	CARTER	He's blanked out on that one particular point.
L205478	u5224	m346	GRANT	Can't remember?... What do you mean?
L205477	u5221	m346	CARTER	Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
L204934	u5224	m346	GRANT	Where can I get a cab back to town?
L204933	u5221	m346	CARTER	Yes?
L204932	u5224	m346	GRANT	Just one, General...
L204929	u5224	m346	GRANT	Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
L204928	u5221	m346	CARTER	There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
L204900	u5224	m346	GRANT	Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
L204899	u5221	m346	CARTER	This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
L204889	u5224	m346	GRANT	Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
L204888	u5221	m346	CARTER	It's only for an hour --
L204887	u5224	m346	GRANT	But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
L204886	u5221	m346	CARTER	Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
L204885	u5224	m346	GRANT	Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
L204884	u5221	m346	CARTER	As part of the Crew.
L204883	u5224	m346	GRANT	You mean <I'm> going along?
L204882	u5221	m346	CARTER	Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
L204881	u5224	m346	GRANT	Trip? Where to?
L204880	u5221	m346	CARTER	And take a little trip with them...
L204879	u5224	m346	GRANT	They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
L204878	u5221	m346	CARTER	That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
L204877	u5224	m346	GRANT	I assume Benes knows how to control it.
L204876	u5221	m346	CARTER	They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
L204875	u5224	m346	GRANT	If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
L204874	u5221	m346	CARTER	We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204873	u5224	m346	GRANT	General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
L204870	u5224	m346	GRANT	Say that again?
L204869	u5221	m346	CARTER	<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204868	u5224	m346	GRANT	I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
L204867	u5221	m346	CARTER	No question of her loyalty.
L204866	u5224	m346	GRANT	His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
L204864	u5221	m346	CARTER	Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
L204863	u5224	m346	GRANT	Right, sir.
L204860	u5224	m346	GRANT	I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
L204859	u5221	m346	CARTER	We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
L204858	u5224	m346	GRANT	But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
L204849	u5221	m346	CARTER	Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
L204848	u5224	m346	GRANT	Wish I knew why.
L204843	u5224	m346	GRANT	What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
L204842	u5221	m346	CARTER	Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
L204841	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
L204840	u5221	m346	CARTER	Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
L204839	u5221	m346	CARTER	Here's the Surgeon.
L204838	u5224	m346	GRANT	I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
L204836	u5224	m346	GRANT	<Me>?
L204835	u5221	m346	CARTER	-- and why we need you.
L204834	u5221	m346	CARTER	Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
L204833	u5224	m346	GRANT	Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
L204832	u5221	m346	CARTER	Brain injury.
L204831	u5224	m346	GRANT	How bad off is he?
L204830	u5221	m346	CARTER	The Other Side got to him.
L204829	u5224	m346	GRANT	Benes... What the devil happened?
L204828	u5224	m346	GRANT	The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
L204827	u5221	m346	CARTER	Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
L204862	u5221	m346	CARTER	And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
L204861	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
L204857	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
L204856	u5221	m346	CARTER	Difficult? He's impossible!
L204855	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
L204854	u5221	m346	CARTER	[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
L204847	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
L204846	u5221	m346	CARTER	Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
L204845	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, Alan.
L205305	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
L205304	u5222	m346	CORA	Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
L205298	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
L205297	u5222	m346	CORA	You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
L205228	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	With no laser --
L205227	u5222	m346	CORA	We must!
L205226	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
L205219	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We'll know -- in the next breath...
L205218	u5222	m346	CORA	But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
L205189	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
L205188	u5222	m346	CORA	I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
L205115	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
L205114	u5222	m346	CORA	Listen...the Heart.
L205475	u5222	m346	CORA	He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
L205474	u5223	m346	DUVAL	He's making a fine recovery.
L205186	u5222	m346	CORA	I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
L205185	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
L205161	u5223	m346	DUVAL	No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
L205160	u5222	m346	CORA	Air bubbles!... Doctor --
L205080	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
L205079	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
L205068	u5222	m346	CORA	But big enough for us...
L205067	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
L205046	u5222	m346	CORA	They're much smaller than bacteria...
L205045	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
L205003	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Thank you for volunteering.
L205002	u5222	m346	CORA	I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
L205001	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What is it?  Anything wrong?
L205000	u5222	m346	CORA	I -- I want to say...
L204999	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes, Cora.
L204998	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor...
L205425	u5222	m346	CORA	Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
L205424	u5224	m346	GRANT	We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
L205356	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
L205355	u5222	m346	CORA	What do you mean?
L205354	u5224	m346	GRANT	Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
L205353	u5222	m346	CORA	Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
L205352	u5224	m346	GRANT	Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
L205351	u5222	m346	CORA	You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
L205350	u5224	m346	GRANT	As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
L205349	u5222	m346	CORA	That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
L205348	u5224	m346	GRANT	What gives you that idea?
L205347	u5222	m346	CORA	Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
L205346	u5224	m346	GRANT	Such as?
L205345	u5222	m346	CORA	A great deal more than that, I believe...
L205344	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's what they pay me for.
L205343	u5222	m346	CORA	Thank you for saving my life.
L205341	u5222	m346	CORA	I feel much better now...
L205340	u5224	m346	GRANT	No need to get up --
L205323	u5224	m346	GRANT	I can't till the hatch is flooded!
L205322	u5222	m346	CORA	Open it! Open it before they get here!
L205235	u5224	m346	GRANT	I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
L205234	u5222	m346	CORA	Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
L205233	u5224	m346	GRANT	A surgeon might...
L205232	u5222	m346	CORA	No, it requires such absolute precision --
L205231	u5224	m346	GRANT	If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
L205225	u5222	m346	CORA	Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
L205224	u5224	m346	GRANT	You must carry spare parts --
L205207	u5222	m346	CORA	You can't --it's too dangerous --
L205206	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
L205200	u5224	m346	GRANT	Not now. We need air, not greetings!
L205199	u5222	m346	CORA	Shouldn't you answer that?
L205184	u5222	m346	CORA	I have no idea.
L205183	u5224	m346	GRANT	Then how come it worked loose?
L205182	u5222	m346	CORA	But I did. I'm positive!
L205181	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
L205145	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
L205144	u5224	m346	GRANT	Look at that...they're changing color...
L205106	u5222	m346	CORA	And if it should take more time to get through --
L205105	u5224	m346	GRANT	-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
L205040	u5224	m346	GRANT	I always thought it was nothing but red.
L205039	u5222	m346	CORA	I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
L204994	u5222	m346	CORA	Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
L204993	u5224	m346	GRANT	A long time, with one man.
L204992	u5222	m346	CORA	I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
L204991	u5224	m346	GRANT	I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
L204990	u5222	m346	CORA	Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
L204989	u5224	m346	GRANT	That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
L204988	u5224	m346	GRANT	Now I know...
L204987	u5222	m346	CORA	That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
L204984	u5222	m346	CORA	You may learn to like it.
L204983	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
L204982	u5222	m346	CORA	I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
L204981	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
L204980	u5222	m346	CORA	You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
L204979	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
L204978	u5222	m346	CORA	We're pushing oxygen today.
L204977	u5224	m346	GRANT	Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
L205404	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
L205403	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
L205390	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
L205389	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Removal Point? What're you talking about!
L205384	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Breath of God...
L205383	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	What's that?
L205382	u5223	m346	DUVAL	You left something out.
L205381	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
L205379	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
L205378	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
L205369	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
L205368	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
L205367	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
L205366	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
L205365	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
L205364	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
L205363	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I've done all I could with the laser.
L205362	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
L205361	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It's against my better Judgment...
L205339	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
L205338	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes...
L205337	u5223	m346	DUVAL	That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
L205217	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing -- against all that force.
L205216	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What can we do?
L205153	u5223	m346	DUVAL	You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
L205152	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
L205108	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
L205107	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We can't take a second more.
L205058	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
L205057	u5223	m346	DUVAL	But that isn't possible.
L205049	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
L205048	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
L205047	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
L205022	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It's too late now. We must go on.
L205021	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
L205020	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Doctor, what's wrong?
L205456	u5224	m346	GRANT	It's too late!
L205455	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What about Dr. Michaels?
L205454	u5224	m346	GRANT	You said there was a quick way out!
L205436	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
L205435	u5224	m346	GRANT	The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
L205420	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
L205419	u5224	m346	GRANT	Doctor, we've just about had it.
L205413	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
L205412	u5224	m346	GRANT	How does it look, Doctor?
L205376	u5224	m346	GRANT	Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man...
L205375	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- 
L205284	u5224	m346	GRANT	Then why not take it?
L205283	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
L205282	u5224	m346	GRANT	Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
L205281	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
L205230	u5223	m346	DUVAL	No, there's no other way.
L205229	u5224	m346	GRANT	Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
L205172	u5224	m346	GRANT	Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
L205171	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
L205150	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Oxygenation...
L205149	u5224	m346	GRANT	Don't tell me they're refueling...
L205148	u5223	m346	DUVAL	A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
L205147	u5224	m346	GRANT	Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
L205139	u5223	m346	DUVAL	They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
L205138	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
L205042	u5224	m346	GRANT	Quite a piece of plumbing.
L205041	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
L205038	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
L205037	u5224	m346	GRANT	You mean Inner Space is endless?
L205036	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
L205407	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
L205406	u5224	m346	GRANT	I don't believe that.
L205402	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
L205401	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sorry, but the situation has changed.
L205400	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
L205393	u5224	m346	GRANT	How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
L205392	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
L205391	u5224	m346	GRANT	Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
L205334	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
L205333	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like quite a way to go...
L205287	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
L205286	u5224	m346	GRANT	They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
L205277	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
L205276	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like somebody declared war.
L205271	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
L205270	u5224	m346	GRANT	Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
L205267	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
L205266	u5224	m346	GRANT	I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
L205265	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
L205261	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It's possible --
L205260	u5224	m346	GRANT	Two in a row?
L205259	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
L205258	u5224	m346	GRANT	You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
L205257	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
L205256	u5224	m346	GRANT	That line was tampered with...
L205255	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	You have no right to blame Duval --
L205254	u5224	m346	GRANT	I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
L205253	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Sabotage? I don't understand...
L205252	u5224	m346	GRANT	Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
L205251	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
L205250	u5224	m346	GRANT	Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
L205249	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
L205248	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like the sea, at dawn.
L205241	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Send the following message...
L205240	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
L205239	u5224	m346	GRANT	They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
L205238	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
L205237	u5224	m346	GRANT	Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
L205236	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
L205212	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
L205211	u5224	m346	GRANT	All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
L205209	u5224	m346	GRANT	There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
L205208	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
L205204	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, we better get on with it.
L205203	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
L205176	u5224	m346	GRANT	If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
L205175	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	At this size, I would certainly think so.
L205126	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
L205125	u5224	m346	GRANT	There it is!
L205117	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
L205116	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sounds like heavy artillery...
L205083	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Request removal, Mr. Grant.
L205082	u5224	m346	GRANT	If there's any chance --
L205081	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Tell them to take us out.
L205078	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
L205077	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
L205074	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
L205073	u5224	m346	GRANT	If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
L205066	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
L205065	u5224	m346	GRANT	A what?
L204920	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
L204919	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	About forty miles an hour.
L204902	u5224	m346	GRANT	How are you, Miss Peterson?
L204901	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
L204853	u5224	m346	GRANT	Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
L204852	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
L204851	u5224	m346	GRANT	At an operation?
L204850	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
L204821	u5224	m346	GRANT	And she said it was indelible...
L204820	u5225	m346	MAN	I'm married.
L204819	u5224	m346	GRANT	What'd you do that for?
L204818	u5224	m346	GRANT	Go ahead.
L204817	u5225	m346	MAN	May I?
L204816	u5225	m346	MAN	I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
L204815	u5224	m346	GRANT	Where we going?
L204814	u5225	m346	MAN	I can't tell you.
L204813	u5224	m346	GRANT	I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
L204812	u5225	m346	MAN	Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
L205498	u5224	m346	GRANT	Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
L205497	u5228	m346	OWENS	Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
L205496	u5224	m346	GRANT	We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
L205495	u5228	m346	OWENS	Uh -- what?
L205494	u5224	m346	GRANT	Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
L205452	u5224	m346	GRANT	We can get out through the Lab Section.
L205451	u5228	m346	OWENS	Come on -- it's no use!
L205446	u5224	m346	GRANT	Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
L205445	u5228	m346	OWENS	Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
L205444	u5224	m346	GRANT	What happened?
L205409	u5228	m346	OWENS	Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
L205408	u5224	m346	GRANT	I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
L205170	u5228	m346	OWENS	Enough to breathe, but that's all.
L205169	u5224	m346	GRANT	Any reserve air?
L204996	u5228	m346	OWENS	Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
L204995	u5224	m346	GRANT	'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
L204966	u5224	m346	GRANT	Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
L204965	u5228	m346	OWENS	Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
L204964	u5224	m346	GRANT	All in all, quite a canoe...
L204963	u5228	m346	OWENS	It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
L204962	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
L204961	u5228	m346	OWENS	They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
L204960	u5224	m346	GRANT	If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
L204959	u5228	m346	OWENS	Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
L204958	u5224	m346	GRANT	Atomic fuel?
L204906	u5224	m346	GRANT	That makes two of us.
L204905	u5228	m346	OWENS	Sort of.
L204904	u5224	m346	GRANT	Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
L205300	u5224	m346	GRANT	I could use a lawnmower...
L205299	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	How's it look?
L205293	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
L205292	u5224	m346	GRANT	What's wrong, Skipper?
L205263	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	Look at those Walls up ahead!
L205262	u5224	m346	GRANT	Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
L205174	u5224	m346	GRANT	Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
L205173	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	Yes, there is.
L205156	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
L205155	u5224	m346	GRANT	What is it, Skipper?
L205178	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, by all means. We must try it.
L205177	u5228	m346	OWENS	It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
L205165	u5228	m346	OWENS	Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
L205164	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Was there any damage?
L205163	u5228	m346	OWENS	Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
L205110	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
L205109	u5228	m346	OWENS	I'll never find my way through that.
L204975	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Looks simple to operate.
L204974	u5228	m346	OWENS	That's it...
L204972	u5228	m346	OWENS	On the Repeater.
L204971	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
L204925	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
L204924	u5228	m346	OWENS	Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
L205417	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
L205416	u5228	m346	OWENS	What do you mean?
L205415	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
L205143	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
L205142	u5228	m346	OWENS	The Wall's transparent...
L205141	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
L205140	u5228	m346	OWENS	Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
L205072	u5228	m346	OWENS	I'll do what I can.
L205071	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	Then don't drift down further.
L205070	u5228	m346	OWENS	We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
L224560	u5397	m358	JOHN	Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
L224559	u5392	m358	DARYL	Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
L224556	u5392	m358	DARYL	Nothing.
L224555	u5397	m358	JOHN	So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
L224554	u5392	m358	DARYL	So what?
L224553	u5397	m358	JOHN	Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
L224552	u5392	m358	DARYL	What I know is what I told you.
L224551	u5397	m358	JOHN	Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
L224546	u5397	m358	JOHN	Well, I think you do.
L224545	u5392	m358	DARYL	No, I don't.
L224544	u5397	m358	JOHN	You know what I'm saying.
L224543	u5392	m358	DARYL	What are you saying?
L224542	u5397	m358	JOHN	You remember Mary Finelli?
L224541	u5392	m358	DARYL	Yeah.
L224540	u5397	m358	JOHN	You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
L224539	u5392	m358	DARYL	That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
L224714	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	I'll go find Hayes.
L224713	u5393	m358	DESK SGT.	No, I think he's up in interrogation.
L224712	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Where's the collar, in the cells?
L224711	u5393	m358	DESK SGT.	Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
L224710	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	They around?
L224709	u5393	m358	DESK SGT.	That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
L224708	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
L224707	u5393	m358	DESK SGT.	Yeah.
L224706	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
L223971	u5402	m358	SUPERVISOR	There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
L223970	u5394	m358	FRANK	How do we get to the vault door?
L223965	u5402	m358	SUPERVISOR	We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
L223964	u5394	m358	FRANK	We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
L223963	u5402	m358	SUPERVISOR	Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
L223962	u5394	m358	FRANK	You're shitting me!
L223961	u5402	m358	SUPERVISOR	Switches are shorted out.
L223960	u5394	m358	FRANK	Why haven't they killed the juice?
L224277	u5394	m358	FRANK	Elvis has left the building.
L224276	u5395	m358	GIBSON	You okay, man?
L224259	u5394	m358	FRANK	Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
L224258	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Gotta be another way up, Frank.
L224255	u5394	m358	FRANK	One way to find out.
L224254	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Don't know what's behind it.
L224253	u5394	m358	FRANK	It looks open on the other side.
L224233	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm alright, Gibby.
L224232	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
L223980	u5395	m358	GIBSON	I should'a been a fucking mailman.
L223979	u5394	m358	FRANK	Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
L223978	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
L223954	u5395	m358	GIBSON	I seem nervous, huh?
L223953	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
L223952	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
L223951	u5394	m358	FRANK	The game, Graham.  The Series?
L223950	u5395	m358	GIBSON	Baltimore?
L223949	u5394	m358	FRANK	Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
L224765	u5399	m358	JULIA	Frank...
L224764	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hey, bud.
L224612	u5394	m358	FRANK	I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
L224611	u5399	m358	JULIA	Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
L224493	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
L224492	u5399	m358	JULIA	The future guy?
L224491	u5394	m358	FRANK	Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
L224465	u5399	m358	JULIA	So am I.
L224464	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm serious.
L224463	u5399	m358	JULIA	I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
L224461	u5394	m358	FRANK	No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
L224460	u5399	m358	JULIA	I know.  He loves that thing.
L224459	u5394	m358	FRANK	I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
L224458	u5399	m358	JULIA	Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
L224457	u5394	m358	FRANK	I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
L224456	u5399	m358	JULIA	Okay...
L224455	u5394	m358	FRANK	There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
L224374	u5399	m358	JULIA	Do you know how much I love you?
L224373	u5394	m358	FRANK	Wish you weren't.
L224372	u5399	m358	JULIA	I'm off.
L224371	u5394	m358	FRANK	He ain't the only one.
L224370	u5399	m358	JULIA	Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
L224347	u5399	m358	JULIA	I love you more.
L224346	u5394	m358	FRANK	I love you, Bud.
L224340	u5399	m358	JULIA	Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
L224339	u5394	m358	FRANK	One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
L224338	u5399	m358	JULIA	You give him his drops?
L224337	u5394	m358	FRANK	I tucked him in at Gordo's.
L224336	u5399	m358	JULIA	Where's Johnny?
L224333	u5394	m358	FRANK	Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
L224332	u5399	m358	JULIA	Frank...what's wrong?
L224098	u5394	m358	FRANK	Sure.
L224097	u5399	m358	JULIA	Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
L224010	u5399	m358	JULIA	Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
L224009	u5394	m358	FRANK	It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
L224008	u5399	m358	JULIA	He did.
L224007	u5394	m358	FRANK	Did he?
L224006	u5399	m358	JULIA	Butch called.
L224005	u5394	m358	FRANK	The usual.
L224004	u5399	m358	JULIA	How was your tour?
L224002	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
L224001	u5399	m358	JULIA	You didn't marry Donna Reed.
L224000	u5394	m358	FRANK	What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
L223999	u5399	m358	JULIA	I think I ruined the sauce...again.
L223998	u5394	m358	FRANK	You alright?
L223997	u5399	m358	JULIA	Damn.
L223996	u5399	m358	JULIA	Well, why not a little of the King?
L223995	u5394	m358	FRANK	How about a little of the King?
L223991	u5399	m358	JULIA	Hey, bud.
L223990	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hey, bud.
L224763	u5400	m358	SATCH	Get him home safe.
L224762	u5394	m358	FRANK	Next time lets put some money on it.
L224761	u5400	m358	SATCH	You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
L224759	u5394	m358	FRANK	No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
L224758	u5400	m358	SATCH	Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
L224757	u5394	m358	FRANK	Satch, you gotta listen to me...
L224756	u5400	m358	SATCH	Deleon.
L224700	u5400	m358	SATCH	Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
L224699	u5394	m358	FRANK	In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
L224698	u5400	m358	SATCH	Frank, this is insane...
L224697	u5394	m358	FRANK	The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
L224696	u5400	m358	SATCH	Frank, please...
L224695	u5394	m358	FRANK	What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
L224694	u5400	m358	SATCH	How's that?
L224693	u5394	m358	FRANK	What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
L224692	u5400	m358	SATCH	Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
L224691	u5394	m358	FRANK	He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
L224690	u5400	m358	SATCH	Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
L224688	u5394	m358	FRANK	Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
L224687	u5400	m358	SATCH	Uh, huh.
L224686	u5394	m358	FRANK	As nuts as that sounds, yes.
L224685	u5400	m358	SATCH	Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
L224684	u5394	m358	FRANK	I swear, Satch.
L224674	u5400	m358	SATCH	You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
L224673	u5394	m358	FRANK	Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
L224672	u5400	m358	SATCH	I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
L224671	u5394	m358	FRANK	No.  This isn't what you think.
L224670	u5400	m358	SATCH	415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
L224669	u5400	m358	SATCH	Do you know where I found this?
L224668	u5394	m358	FRANK	What do you mean?
L224665	u5400	m358	SATCH	Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
L224664	u5394	m358	FRANK	About what?
L224663	u5400	m358	SATCH	Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
L224662	u5394	m358	FRANK	No, I don't.
L224661	u5400	m358	SATCH	I think you know, Frank.
L224660	u5394	m358	FRANK	What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
L224657	u5400	m358	SATCH	I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
L224656	u5394	m358	FRANK	Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
L224655	u5394	m358	FRANK	John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
L224654	u5400	m358	SATCH	Frank, we need to talk...
L224651	u5400	m358	SATCH	Hello, Frank.
L224650	u5394	m358	FRANK	Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
L224102	u5394	m358	FRANK	Luck, my ass.
L224101	u5400	m358	SATCH	Lucky throw, fire boy.
L224310	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
L224309	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
L224307	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm right here behind you...
L224306	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	Wait...
L224305	u5394	m358	FRANK	You ready?
L224303	u5394	m358	FRANK	No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
L224302	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
L224301	u5394	m358	FRANK	Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
L224300	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	I'm scared.
L224143	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
L224142	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
L224015	u5394	m358	FRANK	C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
L224014	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	Daddy, I'm scared.
L224013	u5394	m358	FRANK	Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
L224012	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
L224011	u5394	m358	FRANK	Okay, start pedaling.
L223994	u5394	m358	FRANK	Glad to hear that.
L223993	u5398	m358	JOHNNY	I know.  Sorry, Dad.
L223992	u5394	m358	FRANK	Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
L224771	u5397	m358	JOHN	I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
L224770	u5394	m358	FRANK	What's wrong?
L224769	u5397	m358	JOHN	Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
L224768	u5394	m358	FRANK	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
L224767	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
L224678	u5394	m358	FRANK	Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
L224677	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
L224676	u5394	m358	FRANK	John, you there?
L224659	u5394	m358	FRANK	Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
L224658	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, what the hell is going on?
L224653	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, you there?
L224652	u5394	m358	FRANK	What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
L224648	u5397	m358	JOHN	Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
L224647	u5394	m358	FRANK	You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
L224614	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hang on.
L224613	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
L224610	u5394	m358	FRANK	Huh?
L224609	u5397	m358	JOHN	Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
L224608	u5394	m358	FRANK	I got it.
L224607	u5394	m358	FRANK	Okay, okay...
L224606	u5397	m358	JOHN	Please, Dad, just do it.
L224605	u5394	m358	FRANK	What...
L224604	u5397	m358	JOHN	Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
L224603	u5394	m358	FRANK	How the hell am I gonna do that?
L224602	u5397	m358	JOHN	His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
L224601	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?
L224600	u5397	m358	JOHN	We got him!  Dad you got him!
L224599	u5394	m358	FRANK	In my pocket.
L224598	u5397	m358	JOHN	He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
L224597	u5394	m358	FRANK	No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
L224596	u5397	m358	JOHN	He took your wallet?
L224595	u5394	m358	FRANK	He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
L224594	u5397	m358	JOHN	What?
L224593	u5394	m358	FRANK	John, he's got my driver's license.
L224592	u5397	m358	JOHN	I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
L224591	u5394	m358	FRANK	Johnny, I know, but...
L224590	u5397	m358	JOHN	But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
L224589	u5394	m358	FRANK	I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
L224588	u5397	m358	JOHN	I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
L224587	u5394	m358	FRANK	This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
L224586	u5397	m358	JOHN	No.
L224585	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
L224584	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's not your fault, Dad.
L224583	u5394	m358	FRANK	He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
L224520	u5394	m358	FRANK	Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
L224519	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah, I think so...
L224518	u5394	m358	FRANK	You all right?
L224517	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm right here, Dad.
L224516	u5394	m358	FRANK	John, you still there?
L224495	u5397	m358	JOHN	H-hi.
L224494	u5394	m358	FRANK	John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
L224490	u5397	m358	JOHN	You there?
L224489	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hang on a sec, John.
L224488	u5394	m358	FRANK	Wow.
L224487	u5397	m358	JOHN	Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
L224486	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yeah, you betcha.
L224485	u5397	m358	JOHN	You really wanna know?
L224484	u5394	m358	FRANK	Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
L224483	u5397	m358	JOHN	We're okay...we're good, Dad.
L224482	u5394	m358	FRANK	What are we like in...1998?
L224481	u5397	m358	JOHN	Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
L224480	u5394	m358	FRANK	What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
L224479	u5397	m358	JOHN	Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
L224478	u5394	m358	FRANK	Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
L224477	u5394	m358	FRANK	All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
L224476	u5397	m358	JOHN	Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
L224475	u5394	m358	FRANK	How?
L224474	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
L224473	u5394	m358	FRANK	Got it.
L224472	u5397	m358	JOHN	Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
L224471	u5394	m358	FRANK	Whatta we do now?
L224470	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
L224469	u5394	m358	FRANK	No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
L224468	u5397	m358	JOHN	Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
L224467	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'll be damned.
L224423	u5397	m358	JOHN	Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
L224422	u5394	m358	FRANK	What do I tell them?
L224421	u5397	m358	JOHN	They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
L224420	u5394	m358	FRANK	Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
L224417	u5397	m358	JOHN	Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
L224416	u5394	m358	FRANK	What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
L224415	u5397	m358	JOHN	You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
L224414	u5397	m358	JOHN	I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
L224413	u5394	m358	FRANK	I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
L224412	u5397	m358	JOHN	They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
L224411	u5394	m358	FRANK	So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
L224410	u5397	m358	JOHN	No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
L224409	u5394	m358	FRANK	What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
L224408	u5397	m358	JOHN	That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
L224407	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'll warn them.
L224406	u5397	m358	JOHN	I don't know...  What about the other women?
L224405	u5394	m358	FRANK	I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
L224404	u5397	m358	JOHN	Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
L224403	u5394	m358	FRANK	What are you talking about?
L224402	u5397	m358	JOHN	He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
L224401	u5394	m358	FRANK	Whatta you mean...
L224400	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
L224399	u5394	m358	FRANK	What kinda twisted animal.
L224398	u5397	m358	JOHN	There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
L224397	u5394	m358	FRANK	Murdered?  Why?
L224394	u5394	m358	FRANK	Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
L224393	u5397	m358	JOHN	October 22, 1969.
L224392	u5394	m358	FRANK	When?
L224391	u5397	m358	JOHN	No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
L224390	u5394	m358	FRANK	She just died, your mother just died?
L224389	u5397	m358	JOHN	She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
L224388	u5394	m358	FRANK	Whatta you mean she's not here?
L224387	u5397	m358	JOHN	She's not here.
L224386	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?  What is it?
L224385	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's Mom.
L224384	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
L224383	u5397	m358	JOHN	Something happened, something...
L224382	u5394	m358	FRANK	"Are you alright""?"
L224381	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
L224380	u5394	m358	FRANK	Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
L224326	u5397	m358	JOHN	What it was like when you died in the fire...
L224325	u5394	m358	FRANK	What, Johnny?  What is it?
L224324	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
L224323	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm glad.
L224322	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
L224321	u5394	m358	FRANK	Tell me.
L224320	u5397	m358	JOHN	We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
L224319	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
L224318	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad, you there?  You okay?
L224317	u5394	m358	FRANK	You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
L224316	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah, it's me.
L224315	u5394	m358	FRANK	Chief?!  Is that you?
L224314	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad...?
L224221	u5394	m358	FRANK	I don't understand.
L224220	u5397	m358	JOHN	Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
L224219	u5397	m358	JOHN	Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
L224218	u5394	m358	FRANK	But that's tomorrow.
L224217	u5397	m358	JOHN	October 12, 1969.
L224216	u5394	m358	FRANK	When?
L224215	u5397	m358	JOHN	It did, Pop.  It did.
L224214	u5394	m358	FRANK	That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
L224213	u5397	m358	JOHN	It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
L224212	u5394	m358	FRANK	On the job?
L224211	u5397	m358	JOHN	Fire.
L224210	u5394	m358	FRANK	Why?
L224209	u5397	m358	JOHN	I never knew you, Dad.
L224208	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?
L224207	u5397	m358	JOHN	I lost you.
L224206	u5394	m358	FRANK	What are you talking about?
L224205	u5397	m358	JOHN	But you're not...you're not still here.
L224204	u5394	m358	FRANK	It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
L224203	u5397	m358	JOHN	No wait, don't go!
L224202	u5394	m358	FRANK	I think I'm losing you.
L224201	u5397	m358	JOHN	What's that?
L224200	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
L224199	u5394	m358	FRANK	You're still my Little Chief, right?
L224197	u5397	m358	JOHN	Nah, I gave it up.
L224196	u5394	m358	FRANK	Too busy playin' ball, huh?
L224195	u5397	m358	JOHN	No, not yet.
L224193	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah...I think so.
L224192	u5394	m358	FRANK	It's really you, isn't it?
L224191	u5397	m358	JOHN	"I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I""m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998."
L224190	u5394	m358	FRANK	1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
L224189	u5397	m358	JOHN	1998.
L224188	u5394	m358	FRANK	Thirty-five?  That would make it...
L224187	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm thirty-five years old.
L224186	u5394	m358	FRANK	You sound...ground up...?
L224185	u5397	m358	JOHN	Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
L224184	u5394	m358	FRANK	Yeah, that's how Hams work.
L224183	u5397	m358	JOHN	Sun spot?
L224182	u5394	m358	FRANK	We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
L224181	u5397	m358	JOHN	I don't know.
L224180	u5394	m358	FRANK	How could this be happening?
L224179	u5394	m358	FRANK	Johnny...?
L224178	u5397	m358	JOHN	Dad...?
L224177	u5397	m358	JOHN	What if it's not...
L224176	u5394	m358	FRANK	That's impossible.
L224174	u5394	m358	FRANK	What's happening?
L224173	u5397	m358	JOHN	You just burned the desk.
L224172	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?
L224171	u5397	m358	JOHN	Oh my god.
L224170	u5394	m358	FRANK	Nothing...I just spilled something.
L224169	u5397	m358	JOHN	What's going on?
L224166	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm not dreaming.
L224165	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
L224164	u5394	m358	FRANK	What the hell...
L224163	u5397	m358	JOHN	My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
L224162	u5394	m358	FRANK	29 years...?
L224161	u5397	m358	JOHN	29-years ago.
L224160	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?
L224159	u5397	m358	JOHN	Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
L224158	u5394	m358	FRANK	W...B...2...YXB.
L224157	u5397	m358	JOHN	What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
L224156	u5394	m358	FRANK	What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
L224155	u5397	m358	JOHN	Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
L224154	u5394	m358	FRANK	Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
L224153	u5397	m358	JOHN	You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
L224152	u5394	m358	FRANK	Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
L224151	u5397	m358	JOHN	Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
L224150	u5394	m358	FRANK	Frank...Frank Sullivan.
L224149	u5397	m358	JOHN	What'd you say your name was?
L224148	u5394	m358	FRANK	Uh huh...
L224147	u5397	m358	JOHN	You call your son Little Chief?
L224146	u5394	m358	FRANK	Oh, that was my kid.
L224145	u5397	m358	JOHN	What'd you just say?
L224144	u5394	m358	FRANK	Sorry 'bout that.
L224141	u5397	m358	JOHN	This afternoon?
L224140	u5394	m358	FRANK	What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
L224139	u5397	m358	JOHN	Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
L224138	u5394	m358	FRANK	The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
L224137	u5397	m358	JOHN	Huh?
L224136	u5394	m358	FRANK	I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
L224135	u5397	m358	JOHN	Hello?
L224134	u5394	m358	FRANK	...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
L224092	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
L224091	u5394	m358	FRANK	I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
L224088	u5394	m358	FRANK	Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
L224087	u5397	m358	JOHN	I got fed up with all the bullshit.
L224086	u5394	m358	FRANK	What?
L224085	u5397	m358	JOHN	I don't really follow baseball anymore.
L224084	u5394	m358	FRANK	Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
L224082	u5397	m358	JOHN	I can't believe people are still using these things.
L224081	u5394	m358	FRANK	15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
L224080	u5397	m358	JOHN	I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
L224079	u5394	m358	FRANK	Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
L224078	u5397	m358	JOHN	Queens, New York.
L224077	u5394	m358	FRANK	Where are you transmitting from?
L224076	u5397	m358	JOHN	Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
L224075	u5394	m358	FRANK	Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
L224074	u5397	m358	JOHN	Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
L224073	u5394	m358	FRANK	Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
L224072	u5397	m358	JOHN	Name's John.
L224071	u5394	m358	FRANK	WB2YKXB, who've I got?
L224070	u5397	m358	JOHN	Uh, hello?
L224515	u5396	m358	GORDO	You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
L224514	u5397	m358	JOHN	Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
L224513	u5396	m358	GORDO	I better give you my address then.
L224511	u5396	m358	GORDO	How'd you know my name, mister?
L224510	u5397	m358	JOHN	Gordo?
L224509	u5396	m358	GORDO	This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
L224294	u5397	m358	JOHN	The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
L224293	u5396	m358	GORDO	Huh?
L224290	u5396	m358	GORDO	Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
L224289	u5397	m358	JOHN	Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
L224288	u5396	m358	GORDO	Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
L224287	u5397	m358	JOHN	My father didn't die in a fire?
L224286	u5396	m358	GORDO	Huh?
L224285	u5397	m358	JOHN	My father didn't die in a fire?
L224281	u5396	m358	GORDO	What?
L224280	u5397	m358	JOHN	Longbranch...?
L224279	u5396	m358	GORDO	John.  John, you all right?
L224235	u5397	m358	JOHN	Better.
L224234	u5396	m358	GORDO	How you feeling?
L224228	u5396	m358	GORDO	I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
L224227	u5397	m358	JOHN	The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
L224226	u5396	m358	GORDO	Go in where?
L224225	u5397	m358	JOHN	No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
L224224	u5396	m358	GORDO	C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
L224223	u5397	m358	JOHN	I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
L224222	u5396	m358	GORDO	Sull!  What the hell!
L224039	u5397	m358	JOHN	I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
L224038	u5396	m358	GORDO	Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
L224034	u5397	m358	JOHN	What the hell is that smell?
L224033	u5396	m358	GORDO	Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
L224032	u5396	m358	GORDO	Sully!  Is that you?
L224031	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
L224573	u5397	m358	JOHN	Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
L224572	u5400	m358	SATCH	He ain't our guy, John.
L224571	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah.  Sure.
L224570	u5400	m358	SATCH	Got a minute?
L224538	u5400	m358	SATCH	I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
L224537	u5397	m358	JOHN	What?
L224536	u5400	m358	SATCH	Uh, huh.
L224535	u5397	m358	JOHN	Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
L224534	u5400	m358	SATCH	So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
L224533	u5397	m358	JOHN	I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
L224530	u5400	m358	SATCH	Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
L224529	u5397	m358	JOHN	Okay, lemme walk you through it.
L224451	u5400	m358	SATCH	This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
L224450	u5397	m358	JOHN	Which means he probably knew her.
L224449	u5400	m358	SATCH	April 16...?  That means she was the first.
L224448	u5397	m358	JOHN	Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
L224431	u5400	m358	SATCH	That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
L224430	u5397	m358	JOHN	That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
L224366	u5400	m358	SATCH	What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
L224365	u5397	m358	JOHN	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
L224364	u5400	m358	SATCH	She makes ten.
L224361	u5400	m358	SATCH	And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
L224360	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
L224359	u5400	m358	SATCH	This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
L224357	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah.  That's it.
L224356	u5400	m358	SATCH	Another rough night, huh?  That it?
L224292	u5397	m358	JOHN	Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
L224291	u5400	m358	SATCH	Maybe you outta lay off a little...
L224283	u5397	m358	JOHN	Whoa, I just...I just...
L224282	u5400	m358	SATCH	You're not looking too good.
L224106	u5400	m358	SATCH	Nothing you're willing to do.
L224105	u5397	m358	JOHN	She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
L224104	u5400	m358	SATCH	Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
L224506	u5399	m358	JULIA	I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
L224505	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
L224504	u5399	m358	JULIA	Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
L224503	u5397	m358	JOHN	I try to be.
L224502	u5399	m358	JULIA	Are you a good cop, John?
L224501	u5397	m358	JOHN	She's pretty special.
L224500	u5399	m358	JULIA	You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
L224499	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
L224498	u5399	m358	JULIA	My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
L224497	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah, that's right.
L224496	u5399	m358	JULIA	Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
L224130	u5397	m358	JOHN	Look who's talking.
L224129	u5399	m358	JULIA	You work too hard, John.
L224128	u5397	m358	JOHN	I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
L224127	u5399	m358	JULIA	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
L224126	u5397	m358	JOHN	So how'd you like LION KING?
L224125	u5399	m358	JULIA	Close.
L224124	u5397	m358	JOHN	No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
L224123	u5399	m358	JULIA	Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
L224122	u5397	m358	JOHN	So how are things at the hospital?
L224121	u5399	m358	JULIA	I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
L224120	u5397	m358	JOHN	Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
L224119	u5399	m358	JULIA	I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
L224118	u5397	m358	JOHN	Sounds good.
L224117	u5399	m358	JULIA	I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
L224064	u5397	m358	JOHN	Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
L224063	u5399	m358	JULIA	Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
L224752	u5397	m358	JOHN	It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
L224751	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Fuck you, asshole.
L224750	u5397	m358	JOHN	You have the right to speak to an att --
L224749	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Sullivan?
L224748	u5397	m358	JOHN	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
L224747	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Who the fuck is this?
L224746	u5397	m358	JOHN	You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
L224745	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Hell-
L224646	u5397	m358	JOHN	I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
L224645	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Who are you?
L224643	u5397	m358	JOHN	Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
L224642	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Huh.
L224641	u5397	m358	JOHN	No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
L224640	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	No kiddin'?
L224639	u5397	m358	JOHN	As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
L224638	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	I hear that.
L224637	u5397	m358	JOHN	Nah, just working the job.
L224636	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	A hot shot, huh?
L224635	u5397	m358	JOHN	The 2-3.  Homicide.
L224634	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	No.  What house you work?
L224633	u5397	m358	JOHN	I look familiar?
L224632	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
L224631	u5397	m358	JOHN	You used to be on the job?
L224626	u5397	m358	JOHN	Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
L224625	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
L224624	u5397	m358	JOHN	Wife around?
L224623	u5401	m358	SHEPARD	Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
L224622	u5397	m358	JOHN	"Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say ""hello."""
L232132	u5489	m365	JEROME	Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
L232131	u5478	m365	ANTON	Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
L232130	u5489	m365	JEROME	Now is your chance to find out.
L232129	u5478	m365	ANTON	How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
L232119	u5478	m365	ANTON	I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
L232118	u5489	m365	JEROME	Who are you trying to convince?
L232117	u5478	m365	ANTON	You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
L232116	u5489	m365	JEROME	Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
L232115	u5489	m365	JEROME	God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
L232114	u5478	m365	ANTON	It's for the best.
L232113	u5489	m365	JEROME	Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
L232112	u5478	m365	ANTON	It's over.
L232111	u5489	m365	JEROME	There are a few million miles to go yet.
L232110	u5478	m365	ANTON	Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
L232109	u5489	m365	JEROME	You almost sound like you believe that.
L231628	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
L231627	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
L231626	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	It would be five thousand more.
L231625	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	How much extra?
L231619	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
L231618	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	I like football.
L231617	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
L231616	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	Er, no...
L231615	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
L231614	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	He's right, Maria.  That's right.
L231613	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
L231612	u5479	m365	ANTONIO	We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
L232102	u5480	m365	CAESAR	I'll take care of it.
L232101	u5489	m365	JEROME	By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
L232100	u5480	m365	CAESAR	And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
L232099	u5489	m365	JEROME	I'll see what I can do.
L232098	u5480	m365	CAESAR	I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
L232097	u5489	m365	JEROME	I guess I'm a slow learner.
L232096	u5480	m365	CAESAR	No?  What's keeping you?
L232095	u5489	m365	JEROME	Not yet, I'm afraid.
L232094	u5480	m365	CAESAR	So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
L232092	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Where did you get this?
L232091	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
L232084	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Luca could still be an accomplice.
L232083	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
L232038	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
L232037	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
L232021	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
L232020	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Where do we start?
L232019	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	What are you waiting for?
L231967	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
L231966	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	From what budget?
L231965	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
L231964	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	We don't have the manpower.
L231963	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
L231962	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
L231961	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Something's not right.
L231960	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	That's the last.
L231939	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Blood.  From the vein.
L231938	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
L231937	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
L231936	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
L231935	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Don't underestimate these imposters.
L231934	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
L231933	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
L231932	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
L231931	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	"Of course.  He's a ""de-gene-erate"".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder."
L231929	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	"No.  But one or two ""borrowed ladders"" have shown up there in the past."
L231928	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
L231927	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
L231889	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
L231888	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
L231887	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
L231886	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
L231885	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
L231884	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
L231883	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	"--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it ""likely"" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?"
L231882	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
L231881	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
L231805	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
L231804	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	What a pity.
L231803	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
L231802	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
L231801	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	"Who knows with these ""deficients""?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence."
L231800	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
L231798	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
L231797	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
L231796	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
L231795	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
L231794	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	--What <i>about</i> his profile?
L231793	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
L231792	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	No, <i>this</i> is your man.
L231791	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
L231790	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Grudges?
L231789	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
L231788	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	A man's dead, Detective.
L231787	u5481	m365	DETECTIVE HUGO	I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
L232049	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
L232048	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	At least it's nothing contagious.
L232040	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	This time I will supervise each test personally.
L232039	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Twelve have a mission within the week.
L231973	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
L231972	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
L231971	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
L231970	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
L231969	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Thank you, no.
L231968	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Would you care to look--in the telescope?
L231821	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
L231820	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	What a relief.
L231819	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	We believe we have a suspect.
L231817	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
L231816	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Surely you know what you have.
L231815	u5482	m365	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Often.
L231814	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	How often do you test, Director?
L232127	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You have more in common than you know.
L232126	u5488	m365	IRENE	What's wrong with him?
L232125	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
L232124	u5483	m365	EUGENE	He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
L232123	u5488	m365	IRENE	I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
L232122	u5483	m365	EUGENE	That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
L232064	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Again?
L232063	u5488	m365	IRENE	It's about the Director.
L232062	u5483	m365	EUGENE	"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"
L232061	u5488	m365	IRENE	Good to see you're feeling better.
L232059	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
L232058	u5488	m365	IRENE	Jerome--?
L232057	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Hello.
L231685	u5483	m365	EUGENE	At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
L231684	u5493	m365	VINCENT	I don't know exactly, Jerome.
L231683	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
L231682	u5493	m365	VINCENT	German.
L231681	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
L231680	u5493	m365	VINCENT	Suit yourself.
L231679	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
L231678	u5493	m365	VINCENT	What's wrong with it?
L231677	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
L231676	u5493	m365	VINCENT	You okay, Jerome?
L231672	u5493	m365	VINCENT	He's too tall.
L231671	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Six one.
L231670	u5493	m365	VINCENT	Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
L232150	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
L232149	u5489	m365	JEROME	Thank you.
L232148	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm travelling too.
L232147	u5489	m365	JEROME	Where are you going?
L232146	u5483	m365	EUGENE	In case you get back before I do.
L232145	u5489	m365	JEROME	Why have you done this?
L232142	u5483	m365	EUGENE	No, but you might need them when you get back.
L232141	u5489	m365	JEROME	Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
L232140	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I have your samples ready.
L232080	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
L232079	u5489	m365	JEROME	How the hell did you get here.
L232078	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Not bad, Jerome.
L232077	u5489	m365	JEROME	How are you, Jerome?
L232054	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I was never very good at it, remember?
L232053	u5489	m365	JEROME	How would you like to be yourself for the day?
L232052	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Hello?
L231989	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
L231988	u5489	m365	JEROME	"By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?""  Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad.  How are you?"""
L231987	u5483	m365	EUGENE	How long?
L231986	u5489	m365	JEROME	We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
L231985	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
L231984	u5489	m365	JEROME	Will you be okay?
L231983	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You may as well invite her here.
L231982	u5489	m365	JEROME	Everybody goes there.
L231981	u5489	m365	JEROME	Michael's.
L231980	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Where are you taking her?
L231979	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
L231978	u5489	m365	JEROME	She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
L231977	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Again?
L231976	u5489	m365	JEROME	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
L231975	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Where are we going?
L231926	u5483	m365	EUGENE	She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
L231925	u5489	m365	JEROME	Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
L231924	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
L231923	u5489	m365	JEROME	You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
L231922	u5483	m365	EUGENE	"You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to ""breed up"".  What's wrong with her?"
L231921	u5489	m365	JEROME	Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
L231920	u5483	m365	EUGENE	How was your evening?
L231874	u5483	m365	EUGENE	If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
L231873	u5489	m365	JEROME	Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
L231872	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
L231871	u5489	m365	JEROME	Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
L231870	u5489	m365	JEROME	Good choice.
L231869	u5483	m365	EUGENE	If you say so.  The stripe.
L231868	u5489	m365	JEROME	I've got enough on my mind without that.
L231867	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Is that all?
L231866	u5489	m365	JEROME	You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
L231865	u5483	m365	EUGENE	So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
L231863	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm sure I could have.
L231862	u5489	m365	JEROME	You really had other offers?
L231860	u5489	m365	JEROME	I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
L231859	u5483	m365	EUGENE	And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
L231858	u5483	m365	EUGENE	How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
L231857	u5489	m365	JEROME	They'll recognize me.
L231856	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
L231855	u5489	m365	JEROME	--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
L231854	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
L231853	u5489	m365	JEROME	Come on--we're taking off.
L231852	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
L231851	u5489	m365	JEROME	In a corridor.
L231850	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Where?
L231849	u5489	m365	JEROME	They found my eyelash.
L231848	u5483	m365	EUGENE	What makes them think that?
L231847	u5489	m365	JEROME	They think I offed the Director.
L231846	u5483	m365	EUGENE	What are you talking about?
L231845	u5489	m365	JEROME	We can't stay here.
L231844	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Any particular reason?
L231843	u5489	m365	JEROME	Call German.
L231785	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
L231784	u5489	m365	JEROME	It's all right.
L231783	u5483	m365	EUGENE	--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
L231782	u5489	m365	JEROME	--What car?--Go to sleep.
L231781	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
L231780	u5489	m365	JEROME	It's okay, Eugene.
L231779	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
L231771	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You know I'm scared of heights.
L231770	u5489	m365	JEROME	Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
L231768	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
L231767	u5489	m365	JEROME	A day or so.
L231766	u5483	m365	EUGENE	How long do you stay up there before you go?
L231765	u5489	m365	JEROME	11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
L231764	u5483	m365	EUGENE	What <i>is</i> that one?
L231763	u5489	m365	JEROME	And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
L231762	u5483	m365	EUGENE	At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
L231760	u5489	m365	JEROME	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
L231759	u5483	m365	EUGENE	I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
L231757	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
L231756	u5489	m365	JEROME	Let's get out of here.
L231744	u5489	m365	JEROME	You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
L231743	u5483	m365	EUGENE	"Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the ""J. Edgars"" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately."
L231742	u5489	m365	JEROME	That's not the point.
L231741	u5483	m365	EUGENE	So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
L231740	u5489	m365	JEROME	The place is crawling with Hoovers.
L231739	u5483	m365	EUGENE	This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
L231738	u5489	m365	JEROME	He was still warm when they confirmed.
L231737	u5483	m365	EUGENE	What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
L231736	u5489	m365	JEROME	They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
L231735	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You wish.
L231734	u5489	m365	JEROME	The Mission Director.
L231733	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Who died?
L231703	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
L231702	u5489	m365	JEROME	What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
L231701	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
L231700	u5489	m365	JEROME	It's not too late to back out.
L231699	u5483	m365	EUGENE	God, you're serious, aren't you?
L231698	u5489	m365	JEROME	Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
L231697	u5483	m365	EUGENE	God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
L231696	u5489	m365	JEROME	<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
L231695	u5483	m365	EUGENE	You really need that much?
L231693	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Noone orders southpaws anymore.
L231692	u5489	m365	JEROME	You had to be a right-hander.
L231691	u5483	m365	EUGENE	It needs work.
L231690	u5483	m365	EUGENE	Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
L231689	u5489	m365	JEROME	What about this?
L231688	u5483	m365	EUGENE	If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
L231687	u5489	m365	JEROME	I have to know where you come from.
L231630	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
L231629	u5491	m365	MARIA	What will happen to the others?
L231624	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
L231623	u5491	m365	MARIA	Antonio, the choir...
L231622	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
L231621	u5491	m365	MARIA	We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
L231620	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	Anything I've forgotten?
L231611	u5491	m365	MARIA	--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
L231610	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
L231609	u5491	m365	MARIA	We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
L231608	u5484	m365	GENETICIST	First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
L231675	u5485	m365	GERMAN	There's a way.
L231674	u5493	m365	VINCENT	Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
L231673	u5485	m365	GERMAN	You can wear lifts.
L231668	u5493	m365	VINCENT	How tall are you?
L231667	u5485	m365	GERMAN	Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
L231666	u5493	m365	VINCENT	I'd have to bleach my hair.
L231665	u5485	m365	GERMAN	Yeah.
L231664	u5493	m365	VINCENT	That's the hair color in his profile?
L231661	u5485	m365	GERMAN	It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
L231660	u5493	m365	VINCENT	How do I square the accident?
L231659	u5485	m365	GERMAN	No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
L231658	u5493	m365	VINCENT	I hope he's not just a body.
L231657	u5485	m365	GERMAN	He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
L231656	u5485	m365	GERMAN	Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
L231655	u5493	m365	VINCENT	German, is that you?
L231654	u5485	m365	GERMAN	Vincent...Vincent...
L231651	u5485	m365	GERMAN	I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
L231650	u5493	m365	VINCENT	What do you think?
L232090	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
L232089	u5486	m365	HUGO	I've found him too.
L232088	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Hugo!  I've found him!
L232035	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
L232034	u5486	m365	HUGO	Not that.
L232033	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	You worried about the cost?
L232032	u5486	m365	HUGO	These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
L232031	u5487	m365	INVESTIGATOR	Why not?
L232030	u5486	m365	HUGO	My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
L232139	u5488	m365	IRENE	Not so long--just once around the sun.
L232138	u5489	m365	JEROME	A year is a long time.
L232045	u5489	m365	JEROME	We could go together one day.
L232044	u5488	m365	IRENE	--when you go away.
L232042	u5489	m365	JEROME	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
L232041	u5488	m365	IRENE	What is it?
L232029	u5489	m365	JEROME	That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
L232028	u5488	m365	IRENE	You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
L232027	u5489	m365	JEROME	"But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?"
L232026	u5488	m365	IRENE	So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
L232025	u5489	m365	JEROME	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
L232024	u5488	m365	IRENE	What happened?
L232006	u5489	m365	JEROME	We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
L232005	u5488	m365	IRENE	My medication.  I left it back there.
L232004	u5489	m365	JEROME	Come on.
L232003	u5488	m365	IRENE	I can't.
L232002	u5489	m365	JEROME	It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
L232001	u5488	m365	IRENE	Who are they?
L232000	u5489	m365	JEROME	Let's walk.
L231999	u5488	m365	IRENE	What about the car?
L231997	u5489	m365	JEROME	Those checks take forever.
L231996	u5488	m365	IRENE	Why are we leaving?
L231991	u5489	m365	JEROME	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
L231990	u5488	m365	IRENE	What <i>is</i> this place?
L231959	u5489	m365	JEROME	I guess somebody beat me to it.
L231958	u5488	m365	IRENE	So you didn't do it after all.
L231919	u5489	m365	JEROME	Of course.
L231918	u5488	m365	IRENE	Of course I think about it every day.
L231917	u5488	m365	IRENE	Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
L231916	u5489	m365	JEROME	What exactly is wrong?
L231915	u5488	m365	IRENE	It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
L231913	u5488	m365	IRENE	I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
L231912	u5489	m365	JEROME	You'll be next.
L231911	u5488	m365	IRENE	I envy you, Jerome.
L231893	u5489	m365	JEROME	Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
L231892	u5488	m365	IRENE	You're angry--
L231891	u5489	m365	JEROME	Yes...<i>yes</i>...
L231890	u5488	m365	IRENE	You didn't know?
L231841	u5488	m365	IRENE	You celebrate, Jerome?
L231840	u5489	m365	JEROME	Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
L231839	u5488	m365	IRENE	Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
L231838	u5489	m365	JEROME	Does it have a name?
L231837	u5488	m365	IRENE	In the South Wing.
L231836	u5489	m365	JEROME	Where?
L231835	u5488	m365	IRENE	They found an eyelash.
L231834	u5489	m365	JEROME	It was a mercy-killing after all.
L231833	u5488	m365	IRENE	Friend?
L231832	u5489	m365	JEROME	Have they found our friend?
L231828	u5488	m365	IRENE	I know about you.
L231827	u5489	m365	JEROME	We were just looking.
L231826	u5488	m365	IRENE	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
L231729	u5489	m365	JEROME	I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
L231728	u5488	m365	IRENE	Why would we do that?
L231727	u5489	m365	JEROME	Why don't we say we were together?
L231726	u5488	m365	IRENE	No.
L231725	u5489	m365	JEROME	So we don't know for sure about you, either.
L231724	u5488	m365	IRENE	Yes.
L231723	u5489	m365	JEROME	Were <i>you</i> alone?
L231722	u5488	m365	IRENE	I was at home.
L231721	u5489	m365	JEROME	Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
L231720	u5489	m365	JEROME	No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
L231719	u5488	m365	IRENE	Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
L231718	u5489	m365	JEROME	Last night?  I was at home.
L231717	u5488	m365	IRENE	I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
L231716	u5489	m365	JEROME	No bother.
L232158	u5490	m365	LAMAR	--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
L232157	u5489	m365	JEROME	Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
L232156	u5490	m365	LAMAR	Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
L232155	u5489	m365	JEROME	There's a problem, Lamar.
L232154	u5490	m365	LAMAR	Flight got you nervous?
L232153	u5490	m365	LAMAR	New policy.
L232152	u5489	m365	JEROME	What's this, Lamar?
L231957	u5489	m365	JEROME	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
L231956	u5490	m365	LAMAR	I've got enough here.
L231586	u5489	m365	JEROME	I'll tell you at the end of the week.
L231585	u5490	m365	LAMAR	If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
L231583	u5489	m365	JEROME	Only every time I'm in here.
L231582	u5490	m365	LAMAR	Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
L231602	u5491	m365	MARIA	Antonio--
L231601	u5492	m365	NURSE	The name?  For the certificate.
L231596	u5492	m365	NURSE	Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
L231595	u5491	m365	MARIA	Not like <i>this</i> one.
L231594	u5492	m365	NURSE	--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
L231593	u5492	m365	NURSE	Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
L231592	u5491	m365	MARIA	I'm not doing it.
L231591	u5492	m365	NURSE	The doctor will give you something.
L231590	u5491	m365	MARIA	No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
L231589	u5492	m365	NURSE	I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
L231588	u5491	m365	MARIA	I can't do this.
L231587	u5492	m365	NURSE	What are you doing?
L281491	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
L281490	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
L281489	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
L281488	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
L281487	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
L281486	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
L281485	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	No joke, Lieutenant.
L281484	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
L281493	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.
L281492	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You didn't see this.  Understand?
L281474	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
L281473	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
L281472	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	They appear to be authentic.
L281471	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What do you think?
L281464	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Talk to me about what?
L281463	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
L281462	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
L281461	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Lieutenant?
L281454	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Not now.  I'm busy.
L281453	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Lieutenant Bedsoe?
L281680	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	So?
L281679	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
L281678	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Why?
L281677	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	I think it was England.
L281676	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	He had to come from somewhere.
L281675	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
L281674	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Anything from the bank?
L281521	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
L281520	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	We don't have any proof of that.
L281519	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	This ties in with Nash.
L281518	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
L281517	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Tough.
L281516	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
L281515	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
L281482	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'd like you to see this.
L281481	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
L281480	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
L281479	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
L281478	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
L281477	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What is it?
L281476	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
L281384	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Yeah -- how'd you know that?
L281383	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
L281451	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
L281450	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
L281449	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	It's circumstantial.
L281448	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
L281447	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
L281446	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What?
L281445	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
L281444	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
L281814	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
L281813	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes -- I think it is.
L281791	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Most people are afraid of death.
L281790	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
L281789	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Maybe he was a lousy shot.
L281788	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
L281787	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's late.
L281786	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
L281785	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
L281784	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
L281783	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Good evening, Lieutenant.
L281459	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Get outta here.
L281458	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
L281457	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
L281456	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Is that it?
L281455	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
L281443	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
L281442	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You sure?
L281441	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.
L281440	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
L281439	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No.
L281438	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
L281437	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	She was a good woman.
L281435	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	And Brenda?
L281434	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Around.
L281433	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where have you been for the last seven years?
L281432	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  I don't scare easy.
L281431	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
L281430	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Central Park.
L281429	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
L281428	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I already told you.  I took a walk.
L281427	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where were you last night around nine?
L281425	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
L281424	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	A few days ago.
L281423	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	When did you get back?
L281420	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Congratulations.
L281419	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Lieutenant.
L281418	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Detective Bedsoe.
L281626	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	No -- after you.
L281625	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You can go first.
L281619	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You always get to go first.
L281618	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That doesn't matter.
L281617	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I stood up first.
L281616	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No -- I will.
L281615	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I'll go first.
L281602	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's done.
L281601	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Well?
L281581	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
L281580	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  What am I to do?
L281579	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
L281578	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
L281577	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
L281576	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
L281575	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You.
L281574	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	What worries you?
L281573	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Yes.
L281562	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Then she should be an excellent dancer.
L281561	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	She's the King's cousin.
L281560	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	To ask her to dance.
L281557	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
L281556	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Living.  Remember?
L281555	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What are we doing here?
L281503	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Me?  Of course.
L281502	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
L281501	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	How long is the voyage?
L281500	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	France.
L281499	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
L281498	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
L281380	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
L281379	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	If it came down to it what would you do?
L281378	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That is a thought that doesn't please me.
L281377	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
L281376	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	As friends -- always as friends.
L281375	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I'm sure they will.
L281374	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
L281373	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	For what?
L281372	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Thank you, Thomas.
L281371	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Then it's worth the journey.
L281370	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Maybe myself.
L281369	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	And what do you think you will find in another land?
L281368	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
L281367	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Leaving what?
L281366	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm leaving.
L281362	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
L281361	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That is what bothers me.
L281360	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
L281359	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes.
L281358	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	That's all?
L281357	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The river.
L281356	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What else?  What else do you hear right now?
L281355	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I hear you.
L281354	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
L281353	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You?
L281352	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
L281351	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Can't you enjoy it quietly?
L281350	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
L281349	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sing.
L281348	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What?
L281347	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Must you do that?
L281311	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
L281310	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
L281308	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
L281307	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
L281306	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
L281305	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
L281297	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
L281296	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I learned my fill from Romeriz.
L281295	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
L281294	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Who are you?
L281293	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
L281292	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
L281291	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You?
L281290	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye.
L281289	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
L281288	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Caution shows wisdom.
L281287	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
L281286	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
L281250	u5853	m388	FARMER	How?
L281249	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I would like to say goodbye.
L281248	u5853	m388	FARMER	Agreed.
L281247	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
L281246	u5853	m388	FARMER	This cannot be.
L281238	u5853	m388	FARMER	I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
L281237	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
L281236	u5853	m388	FARMER	She'll soon be of age.
L281235	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	She's a treasure she is.
L281234	u5853	m388	FARMER	I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
L281231	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I think you just like to eat dirt.
L281230	u5853	m388	FARMER	What do you think?
L281229	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Can you really tell from doing that?
L281228	u5853	m388	FARMER	It will be a good harvest this year.
L281188	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	I lied.
L281187	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	We had a bargain.  You promised.
L281180	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	How?
L281179	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	Your life.
L281178	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
L281177	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
L281176	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
L281175	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	How comes it your are not afraid?
L281597	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
L281596	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why are you doing this?
L281595	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Where I'm going you cannot follow.
L281594	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Then take me with you.
L281593	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye.
L281592	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Do you love me, Conner?
L281591	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I cannot explain.
L281590	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why?
L281589	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You'll no see me again.
L281588	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Leaving?  For how long?
L281587	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm leaving in the morning.
L281586	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why not?
L281585	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I cannot stay.
L281570	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
L281569	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
L281568	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sometimes.
L281567	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	The past?
L281566	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Different places.
L281565	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Where do you go when your mind drifts?
L281564	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye?
L281277	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
L281276	u5864	m388	REPORTER	No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
L281275	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You guys are from the British museum, right?
L281274	u5864	m388	REPORTER	What are you hoping to find inside?
L281273	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Huge.
L281272	u5864	m388	REPORTER	Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
L281271	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
L281822	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Sounds very -- normal.
L281821	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
L281820	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	What now?
L281802	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Conner?
L281801	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Be careful, Conner.
L281800	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Get out.
L281799	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	He's in there!
L281782	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He will not stop until it is over.
L281781	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Must you fight him?
L281780	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It will end tonight.
L281779	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Where will you go now?
L281778	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
L281777	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	And the other one -- he is like you?
L281776	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
L281772	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You?
L281771	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
L281770	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	How did you know that?
L281769	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
L281768	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	On the back it has--
L281767	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've seen it.
L281766	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Would you like to see it?
L281761	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Not unless they're immortal.
L281760	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
L281759	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	--for three hundred years.
L281758	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
L281757	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
L281756	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
L281755	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
L281754	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	So?
L281753	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
L281752	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You don't really believe this do you?
L281751	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
L281750	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why not?
L281749	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	No.
L281748	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
L281741	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why don't you tell me.
L281740	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
L281739	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
L281738	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes -- it is.
L281737	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Is it?
L281736	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
L281735	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That makes you uncomfortable?
L281734	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I wanted to get to know you better.
L281733	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	How come you wanted to meet tonight?
L281732	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
L281731	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're not an easy person to get to know.
L281730	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've lived all over the world.
L281729	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I'm just trying to place you.
L281728	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why?
L281727	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
L281726	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I know.
L281725	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You didn't answer my question.
L281721	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sorry.
L281720	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're twenty minutes late.
L281719	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Good evening.
L281705	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
L281704	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why?
L281703	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Meet me Tratino's at nine.
L281702	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.
L281700	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You look like you have.
L281699	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.
L281698	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Have you ever heard of the Calan?
L281697	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm interested in mythology.
L281696	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
L281695	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	About what?
L281694	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
L281693	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	New York is dangerous place.
L281692	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Do you always walk around with a sword?
L281691	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then how did he know your name?
L281690	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know.
L281689	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Who was that man last night?
L281688	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't have any answers for you.
L281686	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You remind me of someone I used to know.
L281685	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why do you stare at me like that?
L281684	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Jennifer.
L281683	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
L281652	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know anymore.
L281651	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then who's Russell Nash?
L281650	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because it's my name.
L281649	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
L281648	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'll be fine.
L281647	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're hurt.
L281549	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
L281548	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Where did you get it?
L281546	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why?  What's going on?
L281545	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
L281544	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	If it's good advice.
L281543	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
L281542	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
L281541	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You got me.
L281540	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
L281539	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
L281538	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
L281537	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	A lucky guess.
L281536	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.  How did you know?
L281535	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	In the highlands?
L281534	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
L281533	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Corpses?
L281531	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
L281530	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	To talk to you.
L281529	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	What do you want?
L281528	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	No.  I'm an archaeologist.
L281527	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Are you a cop?
L281526	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I was wondering if I could talk to you?
L281525	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I remember you.
L281524	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
L281393	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We'll see.
L281392	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
L281391	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I like my work.
L281390	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
L281389	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I know, Paul.
L281388	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
L281387	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I was working on the cataloging.
L281386	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	You stayed here again last night?
L281328	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	And this?
L281327	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	It has to be.
L281326	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't think it is a duplication.
L281325	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
L281323	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	His head.  Someone cut it off.
L281322	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What's that next to him?
L281321	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We found him this morning.
L281320	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't know.
L281319	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	How could they get by him?
L281318	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
L281316	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What?  How?
L281315	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Someone broke into the cavern last night.
L281314	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Why?
L281313	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We're holding the workers down below.
L281281	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
L281280	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
L281279	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
L281278	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
L281202	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
L281201	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
L281200	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
L281198	u5857	m388	KILVARA	I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
L281197	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	I do not know -- and even if I did...
L281196	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
L281195	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
L281194	u5857	m388	KILVARA	It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
L281643	u5857	m388	KILVARA	You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
L281642	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It will not end tonight.
L281641	u5857	m388	KILVARA	It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
L281640	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why did you wait?
L281639	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
L281637	u5857	m388	KILVARA	The Kurgan was a pussy.
L281636	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That's what the Kurgan said.
L281635	u5857	m388	KILVARA	I am stronger than you, Highlander.
L281634	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	This cannot be.
L281633	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
L281227	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	Me too.
L281226	u5863	m388	RACHEL	I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
L281225	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
L281224	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Is there anything else you need?
L281223	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I don't know.
L281222	u5863	m388	RACHEL	How can that be?
L281221	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	No.
L281220	u5863	m388	RACHEL	It isn't over, is it, Conner?
L281216	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I can take care of myself.
L281215	u5863	m388	RACHEL	The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
L281214	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I know.
L281213	u5863	m388	RACHEL	You know it's not safe here for you.
L281258	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
L281257	u5866	m388	SARAH	I'll no forget you.
L281256	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
L281255	u5866	m388	SARAH	I love you, Conner.
L281254	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
L281253	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's not for me to decide.
L281252	u5866	m388	SARAH	Don't leave us, Conner.
L281233	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye -- that I would, lass.
L281232	u5866	m388	SARAH	Would you care for some water, Conner?
L281664	u5863	m388	RACHEL	If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
L281663	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
L281662	u5863	m388	RACHEL	And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
L281661	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
L281660	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
L281659	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	My dreams died long ago.
L281658	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
L281656	u5863	m388	RACHEL	You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
L281655	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
L281654	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Why?
L281653	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
L281554	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
L281553	u5863	m388	RACHEL	What will you do?
L281552	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Fine.
L281551	u5863	m388	RACHEL	I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
L281415	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
L281414	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
L281413	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
L281412	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
L281411	u5863	m388	RACHEL	What are you doing?
L281333	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Yes.
L281332	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You kept it?
L281403	u5867	m388	TELLER	Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
L281402	u5860	m388	MR. PARKER	I can take care of myself.
L281401	u5867	m388	TELLER	This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
L281400	u5860	m388	MR. PARKER	No.  The money, please.
L281399	u5867	m388	TELLER	Would you like to deposit this in your account?
L281398	u5860	m388	MR. PARKER	Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
L281397	u5867	m388	TELLER	Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
L329192	u6149	m409	GRANT	A bird cage.
L329191	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What is it?
L329190	u6149	m409	GRANT	Oh, my God.
L329179	u6149	m409	GRANT	One way to find out.
L329178	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Do you think it goes all the way across?
L329079	u6149	m409	GRANT	This is how you play God.
L329078	u6145	m409	AMANDA	This is how you make dinosaurs?
L329015	u6149	m409	GRANT	Quiet!
L329014	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric!
L328983	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
L328982	u6149	m409	GRANT	After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
L328980	u6149	m409	GRANT	A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
L328979	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
L328931	u6149	m409	GRANT	And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
L328930	u6145	m409	AMANDA	ERRR-IIIC!
L329293	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I would completely support that.
L329292	u6150	m409	PAUL	Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
L329272	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
L329271	u6150	m409	PAUL	You mean it?
L329270	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We should try fishing again.
L329216	u6145	m409	AMANDA	But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
L329215	u6150	m409	PAUL	He could have died.
L329214	u6145	m409	AMANDA	How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
L329213	u6150	m409	PAUL	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
L329212	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You couldn't have made that jump.
L329211	u6150	m409	PAUL	My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
L329197	u6150	m409	PAUL	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
L329196	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
L329184	u6150	m409	PAUL	We're not going anywhere, I promise.
L329183	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
L329163	u6150	m409	PAUL	Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
L329162	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
L329160	u6150	m409	PAUL	I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
L329159	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What?...WHAT!?
L329157	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Think.
L329156	u6150	m409	PAUL	I don't remember
L329155	u6145	m409	AMANDA	When did you have it last?
L329154	u6150	m409	PAUL	I don't know. I don't have it with me.
L329134	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
L329133	u6150	m409	PAUL	That one time was just the bumper.
L329132	u6145	m409	AMANDA	This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
L329131	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it?s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
L329130	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Well what?
L329124	u6150	m409	PAUL	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
L329123	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
L329092	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We have to help him.
L329091	u6150	m409	PAUL	It's not safe.
L329090	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's this way.
L329089	u6150	m409	PAUL	Udesky.
L329074	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric!
L329073	u6150	m409	PAUL	Eric! Are you here?
L329056	u6145	m409	AMANDA	It?s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
L329055	u6150	m409	PAUL	I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
L329054	u6145	m409	AMANDA	No, it's...
L329053	u6150	m409	PAUL	I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
L329042	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I filmed this the morning they left.
L329041	u6150	m409	PAUL	That's him. That?s Eric!
L329032	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric...
L329031	u6150	m409	PAUL	Young adult.
L329029	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Just drop it Paul!
L329028	u6150	m409	PAUL	What did you say!
L329027	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing.
L329026	u6150	m409	PAUL	What did you say?
L329025	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing.
L329024	u6150	m409	PAUL	What?
L329023	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Oh, don't worry about that.
L329022	u6150	m409	PAUL	Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
L329021	u6145	m409	AMANDA	"Because ""Dr. Grant"" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."
L329020	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
L329019	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
L329018	u6150	m409	PAUL	No, Dr. Grant says...
L329017	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
L329016	u6150	m409	PAUL	Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
L328997	u6145	m409	AMANDA	So do you.
L328996	u6150	m409	PAUL	You look good.
L328995	u6150	m409	PAUL	People change.
L328994	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You hate to swim.
L328993	u6150	m409	PAUL	Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
L328992	u6145	m409	AMANDA	How much weight have you lost?
L328991	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing you haven't seen before.
L328990	u6150	m409	PAUL	Sorry.
L328970	u6150	m409	PAUL	"We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should ""accept the inevitable."" You believe that?"
L328969	u6145	m409	AMANDA	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
L328968	u6150	m409	PAUL	Her new boyfriend.
L328943	u6150	m409	PAUL	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
L328942	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We can't just...
L328935	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What's a bad idea?
L328934	u6150	m409	PAUL	He says it's a bad idea!
L328933	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What?
L328932	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
L328891	u6145	m409	AMANDA	From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
L328890	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
L328884	u6150	m409	PAUL	We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
L328883	u6145	m409	AMANDA	...once-in-a-lifetime.
L328880	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
L328879	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
L328877	u6145	m409	AMANDA	It is truly, what?s the word? Inspiring.
L328876	u6150	m409	PAUL	First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
L329153	u6146	m409	BILLY	Where is it?
L329152	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You had the phone the whole time?
L329148	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What about Eric?
L329147	u6146	m409	BILLY	Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that?s where he's headed.
L329146	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
L329145	u6146	m409	BILLY	We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
L329094	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's not a kill, he's still alive.
L329093	u6146	m409	BILLY	He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
L329067	u6146	m409	BILLY	Here!
L329066	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
L328967	u6146	m409	BILLY	Who's that?
L328966	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
L328889	u6146	m409	BILLY	How low?
L328888	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
L329263	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
L329262	u6148	m409	ERIC	He loves you too.
L329261	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
L329260	u6148	m409	ERIC	then we should...
L329259	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
L329258	u6148	m409	ERIC	We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
L329256	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Just hold on.
L329255	u6148	m409	ERIC	Where's Dad?
L329253	u6148	m409	ERIC	DAD!
L329252	u6145	m409	AMANDA	PAUL!
L329194	u6146	m409	BILLY	It won't hold!
L329193	u6150	m409	PAUL	Eric!
L329150	u6146	m409	BILLY	Sure.
L329149	u6150	m409	PAUL	He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
L329127	u6146	m409	BILLY	Dr. Grant was.
L329126	u6150	m409	PAUL	I thought you were an expert.
L329125	u6146	m409	BILLY	I don?t know.
L329096	u6146	m409	BILLY	They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
L329095	u6150	m409	PAUL	They couldn?t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
L329007	u6146	m409	BILLY	About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
L329006	u6150	m409	PAUL	Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
L329005	u6146	m409	BILLY	So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
L328978	u6150	m409	PAUL	I didn't know, there were two islands.
L328977	u6146	m409	BILLY	That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
L329202	u6146	m409	BILLY	I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
L329201	u6149	m409	GRANT	NO!
L329200	u6146	m409	BILLY	I CAN GET HIM!
L329172	u6149	m409	GRANT	Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
L329171	u6146	m409	BILLY	You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
L329168	u6149	m409	GRANT	Billy, I can't talk to you now.
L329167	u6146	m409	BILLY	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
L329166	u6149	m409	GRANT	We need to keep moving.
L329088	u6149	m409	GRANT	KEEP GOING!
L329087	u6146	m409	BILLY	ALAN!
L329071	u6149	m409	GRANT	Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
L329070	u6146	m409	BILLY	We could co-write a paper.
L329037	u6149	m409	GRANT	We should take it with us to signal any planes.
L329036	u6146	m409	BILLY	It looks intact.
L329004	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
L329003	u6146	m409	BILLY	I don't remember that on InGen's list.
L329002	u6149	m409	GRANT	Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
L329001	u6146	m409	BILLY	Baryonyx?
L329000	u6149	m409	GRANT	They never got that big.
L328999	u6146	m409	BILLY	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
L328998	u6149	m409	GRANT	How would you classify it?
L328938	u6149	m409	GRANT	I don't think so.
L328937	u6146	m409	BILLY	Is it a rex?
L328914	u6149	m409	GRANT	Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
L328913	u6146	m409	BILLY	I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
L328902	u6149	m409	GRANT	The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
L328901	u6146	m409	BILLY	Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
L328900	u6149	m409	GRANT	Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
L328899	u6146	m409	BILLY	It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
L328898	u6149	m409	GRANT	That does sound lucky.
L328897	u6146	m409	BILLY	No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
L328896	u6149	m409	GRANT	Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
L328867	u6149	m409	GRANT	What?
L328866	u6146	m409	BILLY	They're here.
L328865	u6149	m409	GRANT	Absolutely not.
L328863	u6149	m409	GRANT	Not if it can't dig.
L328862	u6146	m409	BILLY	It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
L328861	u6149	m409	GRANT	You rented an automated litter box.
L328860	u6146	m409	BILLY	Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
L328859	u6149	m409	GRANT	We'll be broke in four weeks.
L328858	u6146	m409	BILLY	How was your trip? Profitable?
L328837	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
L328836	u6149	m409	GRANT	A well-accepted theory.
L328835	u6147	m409	ELLIE	When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
L328834	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Goodbye, Alan.
L328833	u6149	m409	GRANT	Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
L328832	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Let me know if I can help, Alan. You?re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
L328831	u6149	m409	GRANT	I'd better get going.
L328830	u6149	m409	GRANT	The last of my breed.
L328829	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
L328828	u6149	m409	GRANT	It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
L328827	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Good luck with the fund raising.
L328824	u6149	m409	GRANT	To a degree we never imagined.
L328823	u6147	m409	ELLIE	You think they could talk to each other?
L328822	u6149	m409	GRANT	We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
L328821	u6147	m409	ELLIE	I try not to.
L328820	u6149	m409	GRANT	You remember the sounds they made?
L328819	u6147	m409	ELLIE	My favorite.
L328818	u6149	m409	GRANT	Raptors, mostly.
L328817	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Anything good?
L328813	u6149	m409	GRANT	Really?  What do you do there?
L328812	u6147	m409	ELLIE	So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
L328809	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
L328808	u6149	m409	GRANT	He used to know me.
L328799	u6147	m409	ELLIE	He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
L328798	u6149	m409	GRANT	Hmm?
L329291	u6149	m409	GRANT	The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
L329290	u6148	m409	ERIC	What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
L329285	u6149	m409	GRANT	No we're not.
L329284	u6148	m409	ERIC	We're safe!
L329280	u6149	m409	GRANT	Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
L329279	u6148	m409	ERIC	No. I couldn't see.
L329278	u6149	m409	GRANT	Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
L329277	u6149	m409	GRANT	You're right.
L329276	u6148	m409	ERIC	You should.
L329275	u6149	m409	GRANT	It's strikes me now I never told her that.
L329274	u6149	m409	GRANT	She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
L329273	u6148	m409	ERIC	The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
L329236	u6148	m409	ERIC	Something must've scared them.
L329235	u6149	m409	GRANT	Bonitas.
L329223	u6149	m409	GRANT	Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
L329222	u6148	m409	ERIC	But then you never get to go in space.
L329221	u6149	m409	GRANT	See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
L329220	u6148	m409	ERIC	I want to be an astronaut.
L329219	u6149	m409	GRANT	I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
L329218	u6149	m409	GRANT	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
L329217	u6148	m409	ERIC	Do you have any kids?
L329174	u6148	m409	ERIC	Then we go home?
L329173	u6149	m409	GRANT	We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
L329144	u6148	m409	ERIC	Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
L329143	u6149	m409	GRANT	Why?
L329142	u6148	m409	ERIC	Are you sure?
L329141	u6149	m409	GRANT	We need to head for the coast.
L329140	u6148	m409	ERIC	I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
L329139	u6149	m409	GRANT	How much of this island have you explored?
L329138	u6148	m409	ERIC	Mine's new.
L329137	u6149	m409	GRANT	A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
L329136	u6148	m409	ERIC	Know what this is?
L329121	u6148	m409	ERIC	I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
L329120	u6149	m409	GRANT	What did you think?
L329119	u6148	m409	ERIC	Yeah.
L329118	u6149	m409	GRANT	Did you read Malcolm's book?
L329117	u6149	m409	GRANT	The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
L329116	u6148	m409	ERIC	Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
L329115	u6149	m409	GRANT	It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
L329114	u6148	m409	ERIC	Found this, but the battery's dead.
L329113	u6149	m409	GRANT	Any weapons, radios?
L329112	u6148	m409	ERIC	When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
L329111	u6149	m409	GRANT	Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
L329110	u6148	m409	ERIC	The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
L329109	u6149	m409	GRANT	Which one do you prefer?
L329108	u6148	m409	ERIC	You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
L329107	u6149	m409	GRANT	You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
L329106	u6148	m409	ERIC	They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
L329105	u6149	m409	GRANT	On the island.
L329104	u6148	m409	ERIC	In Costa Rica?
L329103	u6149	m409	GRANT	Eric, your parents are both here.
L329232	u6150	m409	PAUL	Stan.
L329231	u6149	m409	GRANT	Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
L329230	u6150	m409	PAUL	Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
L329210	u6150	m409	PAUL	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
L329209	u6149	m409	GRANT	Billy!
L329082	u6149	m409	GRANT	Back out! Move!
L329081	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda!
L329064	u6149	m409	GRANT	But you never came across just one.
L329063	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well that's good.
L329009	u6150	m409	PAUL	"There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The ""plus"" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that."
L329008	u6149	m409	GRANT	There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
L328986	u6149	m409	GRANT	You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
L328985	u6150	m409	PAUL	Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
L328984	u6149	m409	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
L328976	u6150	m409	PAUL	Sure you have. You wrote that book...
L328975	u6149	m409	GRANT	I have never been on this island!
L328974	u6150	m409	PAUL	We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
L328929	u6149	m409	GRANT	Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
L328928	u6150	m409	PAUL	Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
L328927	u6149	m409	GRANT	What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
L328921	u6149	m409	GRANT	This plane can not land!
L328920	u6150	m409	PAUL	Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
L328893	u6150	m409	PAUL	Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
L328892	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's hard to believe.
L328887	u6149	m409	GRANT	I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can?t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
L328886	u6150	m409	PAUL	No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
L328885	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
L328882	u6150	m409	PAUL	Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
L328881	u6149	m409	GRANT	Hmmm.
L328874	u6150	m409	PAUL	I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
L328873	u6149	m409	GRANT	You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
L328872	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
L328871	u6149	m409	GRANT	What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
L330610	u6151	m410	AJAY	No.  I feel something.
L330609	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You hear something?
L330401	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
L330400	u6151	m410	AJAY	Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
L330376	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It certainly does.
L330375	u6151	m410	AJAY	It matches the pictures.
L330232	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
L330231	u6151	m410	AJAY	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
L330230	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Sorry.  We were saying?
L330222	u6159	m410	ROLAND	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
L330221	u6151	m410	AJAY	How do you mean?
L330220	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Just a little bit too much, I think.
L330219	u6151	m410	AJAY	But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
L330218	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
L330217	u6151	m410	AJAY	I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
L330216	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
L330215	u6151	m410	AJAY	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
L330214	u6159	m410	ROLAND	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
L330213	u6151	m410	AJAY	How did you know?
L330383	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
L330382	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
L330302	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
L330301	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there an antidote?
L330254	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
L330253	u6152	m410	EDDIE	It doesn't matter what I think.
L330252	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
L330251	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
L330250	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You are an academic.
L330249	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
L330248	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
L330247	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Minimal.
L330246	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Any damage?
L330197	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
L330196	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm not going, John.
L330194	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
L330193	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John . . .
L330192	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
L330191	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So what?
L330190	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
L330189	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
L330188	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
L330187	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
L330186	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
L330185	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't believe you.
L330184	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
L330183	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What are you talking about?
L330182	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
L330181	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330180	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
L330179	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
L330178	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
L330177	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't know you -- weren't well.
L330176	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
L330175	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Resentful.
L330533	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Everyone, keep your voices down!
L330532	u6158	m410	NICK	Are you looking for a problem?
L330395	u6158	m410	NICK	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
L330394	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	But he's the head of InGen!
L330390	u6158	m410	NICK	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
L330389	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
L330337	u6158	m410	NICK	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
L330336	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
L330304	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	-- my --
L330303	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh --
L330324	u6160	m410	SARAH	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
L330323	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
L330322	u6160	m410	SARAH	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
L330321	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
L330320	u6160	m410	SARAH	And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
L330316	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
L330315	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
L330312	u6160	m410	SARAH	Not without a shot of the nest.
L330311	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
L330309	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I want to see the nesting ground!
L330308	u6160	m410	SARAH	That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
L330710	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Come on!
L330709	u6155	m410	KELLY	Dad!
L330526	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm fine... I'm fine...
L330525	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
L330524	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
L330425	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
L330424	u6155	m410	KELLY	What are you guys gonna do?
L330388	u6155	m410	KELLY	On the side of that one truck.
L330387	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where does it say that?
L330386	u6155	m410	KELLY	InGen.  What's InGen?
L330349	u6155	m410	KELLY	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
L330348	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	How could you possibly?
L330279	u6155	m410	KELLY	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
L330278	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
L330277	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
L330276	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
L330275	u6155	m410	KELLY	I could come with you.
L330274	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That Richard.
L330273	u6155	m410	KELLY	No.  Richard talked to his parents.
L330272	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, is he?
L330271	u6155	m410	KELLY	That was about a year ago.
L330270	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
L330269	u6155	m410	KELLY	Which one?
L330268	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is that kid still bothering you?
L330267	u6155	m410	KELLY	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
L330266	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
L330265	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
L330264	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
L330263	u6155	m410	KELLY	My vacation is over in a week.
L330262	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
L330261	u6155	m410	KELLY	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
L330260	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
L330259	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't even know this woman.
L330258	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
L330256	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
L330255	u6155	m410	KELLY	Hi, Dad.
L330677	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
L330676	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
L330675	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
L330674	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	It's... behind... us.
L330672	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why?
L330671	u6159	m410	ROLAND	We took to the rock.
L330662	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Possible.
L330661	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
L330650	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good.
L330649	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
L330644	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
L330643	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Where's the power and radio setup?
L330637	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Piss.
L330636	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What is that?
L330550	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The velociraptors.
L330549	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What is?
L330450	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Isn't it obvious?
L330449	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What in Christ's name is going on?!
L330443	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
L330442	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You've broken its leg!
L330441	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
L330439	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
L330438	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What?
L330437	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
L330436	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
L330435	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
L330434	u6159	m410	ROLAND	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
L330433	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You rally think this'll draw the parent?
L330431	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
L330430	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
L330429	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	How close do you have to be?
L330428	u6159	m410	ROLAND	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
L330427	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What kind of gun is that?
L330379	u6159	m410	ROLAND	To collect my fee.
L330378	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Where do you think you're going?!
L330364	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good lad.
L330363	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Okay.
L330362	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
L330361	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
L330360	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
L330359	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What?  Why?
L330358	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Cancel that, Dieter.
L330652	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Piss.
L330651	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What's he got in there?
L330210	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
L330209	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
L330208	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
L330207	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
L330206	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You version of it.
L330205	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
L330204	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
L330203	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
L330202	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
L330201	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
L330200	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
L330665	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
L330664	u6160	m410	SARAH	You're going too?
L330663	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You know how to work a radio, don't you?
L330654	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
L330653	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?
L330537	u6160	m410	SARAH	Oh, God.
L330536	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Their what?
L330529	u6160	m410	SARAH	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
L330528	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
L330706	u6158	m410	NICK	Look!  Sarah!
L330705	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Something's wrong.
L330701	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
L330700	u6158	m410	NICK	I think she's with Sarah!
L330699	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I have to find Kelly!
L330698	u6158	m410	NICK	Head for the roof!
L330697	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
L330696	u6158	m410	NICK	It'll hold!
L330695	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
L330694	u6158	m410	NICK	"We're sure as hell not going back out there"""
L330693	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We can't stay in here!
L330691	u6158	m410	NICK	She's with Sarah!
L330690	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where's Kelly?
L330689	u6158	m410	NICK	Come on!
L330648	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't know.
L330647	u6158	m410	NICK	What are they?
L330646	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330645	u6158	m410	NICK	Lava?
L330501	u6158	m410	NICK	No way.
L330500	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330485	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What do you think they want?!
L330484	u6158	m410	NICK	What do they want?!
L330458	u6158	m410	NICK	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
L330457	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
L330456	u6158	m410	NICK	It has a broken leg!
L330455	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	?!
L330423	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
L330422	u6158	m410	NICK	There' no reason for name calling.
L330420	u6158	m410	NICK	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
L330419	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Our chance to do what?
L330418	u6158	m410	NICK	Then this is our chance.
L330345	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
L330344	u6158	m410	NICK	Do you see any family resemblance here?
L330326	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, my God.
L330325	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No way.
L330314	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	She's nuts.
L330313	u6158	m410	NICK	She's gutty.
L330667	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
L330666	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
L330631	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
L330630	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Four, counting the one in the chamber.
L330629	u6159	m410	ROLAND	How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
L330577	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
L330576	u6159	m410	ROLAND	"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, ""why did you go up there to die?""  And he said ""I didn't.  I went up there to live."""
L330575	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	But why?
L330574	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
L330572	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
L330571	u6159	m410	ROLAND	So the truth is more important to you than your life?
L330570	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
L330569	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
L330568	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because it exists.
L330567	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why should they?
L330566	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So that others would know about this place?
L330565	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why did you come here?
L330564	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
L330563	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Feeling a bit blue, are we?
L330562	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
L330561	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What's that?
L330560	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
L330556	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
L330555	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
L330554	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
L330686	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Birdshit?
L330685	u6160	m410	SARAH	These formations.  They're dried --
L330684	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330683	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian.  It's guano.
L330590	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
L330589	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Maybe.  Maybe not.
L330588	u6160	m410	SARAH	You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
L330510	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They're pushing us over the cliff.
L330509	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?!
L330508	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Oh, God.
L330504	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
L330503	u6160	m410	SARAH	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
L330502	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
L330492	u6160	m410	SARAH	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
L330491	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you insane?!
L330490	u6160	m410	SARAH	Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
L330487	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
L330486	u6160	m410	SARAH	That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
L330470	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Think fast, Sarah.
L330469	u6160	m410	SARAH	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
L330468	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Can you set up?
L330393	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John Hammond.
L330392	u6160	m410	SARAH	Funded by whom?
L330391	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
L330342	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm her father.
L330341	u6160	m410	SARAH	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
L330340	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
L330335	u6160	m410	SARAH	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
L330334	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
L330318	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
L330317	u6160	m410	SARAH	No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
L330712	u6160	m410	SARAH	Where's Ian?
L330711	u6158	m410	NICK	Where's Kelly?
L330621	u6158	m410	NICK	JUMP!
L330620	u6160	m410	SARAH	WHAT ARE YOU-
L330499	u6160	m410	SARAH	No.
L330498	u6158	m410	NICK	"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"
L330479	u6158	m410	NICK	I'm trying!
L330478	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hold it down, Nick!
L330474	u6160	m410	SARAH	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
L330473	u6158	m410	NICK	Give it more morphine!
L330467	u6160	m410	SARAH	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
L330466	u6158	m410	NICK	That little black line?
L330385	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
L330384	u6158	m410	NICK	Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
L330351	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
L330350	u6158	m410	NICK	The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
L330328	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, no!
L330327	u6160	m410	SARAH	-- way we could safely --
L330293	u6160	m410	SARAH	I believe in him.
L330292	u6158	m410	NICK	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
L330291	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian's a very good friend of mine.
L330290	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
L330289	u6160	m410	SARAH	You think this is all a joke?
L330288	u6158	m410	NICK	Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
L330287	u6160	m410	SARAH	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
L330286	u6158	m410	NICK	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
L330285	u6160	m410	SARAH	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
L330284	u6158	m410	NICK	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
L330283	u6160	m410	SARAH	So what's your story, Nick?
L330660	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
L330659	u6160	m410	SARAH	You've got to be kidding.
L330633	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Can the kid walk?
L330632	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ask her.
L330600	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
L330599	u6160	m410	SARAH	We have to send someone to look for him!
L330543	u6160	m410	SARAH	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
L330542	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
L330541	u6159	m410	ROLAND	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
L330540	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
L332224	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
L332223	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Phones are out too.
L331990	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The monitors are failing.
L331989	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What now?
L331986	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What?
L331964	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Damn!
L331916	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You're sure we have to?
L331910	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How long will this take?
L332232	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But would we get the phones back?
L332220	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - about two million.
L332075	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How many lines of code are there?
L332074	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What one?
L332073	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625	u6162	m411	DODGSON	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624	u6171	m411	NEDRY	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622	u6171	m411	NEDRY	What?  No menthol?
L331620	u6171	m411	NEDRY	How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615	u6162	m411	DODGSON	You shouldn't use my name.
L331950	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Shhhhh!
L331675	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951	u6167	m411	HARDING	Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907	u6167	m411	HARDING	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906	u6163	m411	ELLIE	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905	u6167	m411	HARDING	Pretty sure.
L331904	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are you sure?
L331903	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902	u6163	m411	ELLIE	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901	u6167	m411	HARDING	They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900	u6163	m411	ELLIE	These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Six weeks?
L331897	u6167	m411	HARDING	Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Look.
L332285	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why?
L332283	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John....
L332273	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Once we have control again we - -
L332190	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332188	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... "
L332185	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Carousel.
L332184	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
L332183	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
L331747	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
L331746	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
L331744	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
L331743	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331742	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Fascinating animals, fascinating.
L331714	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Could I have a tissue please?
L331713	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331712	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	There you are.  Out you come.
L331598	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
L331597	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I have samples all over the kitchen. 
L331596	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
L331595	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Did I say jerk?
L332361	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
L332360	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
L332359	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You can't hold it by yourself!
L332358	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
L332351	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
L332350	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
L331954	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
L331953	u6165	m411	GRANT	Are you sure?
L331948	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
L331947	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and swallows fresh ones.
L331946	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - barfs them up - -
L331945	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
L331944	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
L331943	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - a gizzard - -
L331942	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
L331941	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - like birds - -
L331938	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
L331937	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
L331936	u6165	m411	GRANT	Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
L331931	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah, I know.
L331930	u6165	m411	GRANT	Not just every six weeks.
L331929	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Constantly sick.
L331926	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I know.
L331925	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
L331894	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It's my favorite.
L331893	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
L331831	u6165	m411	GRANT	Dilophosaurus.
L331830	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, shit.
L331691	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
L331690	u6165	m411	GRANT	Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
L331670	u6165	m411	GRANT	We're out of a job.
L331669	u6163	m411	ELLIE	So what are you thinking?
L331665	u6165	m411	GRANT	How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
L331664	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We were right!
L331663	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
L331659	u6165	m411	GRANT	Say again?
L331658	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
L331653	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
L331652	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
L331651	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The - - agility.  You're right!
L331650	u6165	m411	GRANT	The movement!
L331607	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of park is it?
L331606	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why would they care what we think?
L331600	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Small versions of adults, honey.
L331599	u6165	m411	GRANT	And what are those?
L331594	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Sattler.
L331593	u6165	m411	GRANT	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
L331592	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, who's the jerk?
L331582	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
L331581	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
L331580	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anything else, you old fossil?
L331579	u6165	m411	GRANT	The Cretaceous.
L331578	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The what?
L331577	u6165	m411	GRANT	They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
L331576	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
L331575	u6165	m411	GRANT	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
L331574	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
L331573	u6165	m411	GRANT	They smell.
L331572	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Cheap, cheap, cheap.
L331571	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
L331570	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
L331568	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
L331560	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543	u6165	m411	GRANT	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542	u6163	m411	ELLIE	A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541	u6163	m411	ELLIE	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540	u6165	m411	GRANT	The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They died together?
L331538	u6165	m411	GRANT	Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Like hell it is!
L332304	u6170	m411	MULDOON	It's all right.
L332303	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why not?
L332301	u6170	m411	MULDOON	No. We can't.
L332300	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299	u6170	m411	MULDOON	C'mon on, this way.
L332298	u6170	m411	MULDOON	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Stick to my heels.
L332295	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Come on, let's go.
L332280	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay.
L332279	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'm going with you.
L332277	u6170	m411	MULDOON	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What's that?
L332227	u6170	m411	MULDOON	What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They're not here.
L332135	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?!
L332134	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I don't know.
L332133	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Do you see anything?
L332132	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan!
L332131	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Dr. Grant!
L332130	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The other car!
L332129	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Ellie, com one!!
L332128	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No, no, no!
L331758	u6170	m411	MULDOON	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The fences are electrified, right?
L331756	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - shut up.
L332246	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes?
L332238	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster, faster!
L332124	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Please - - chance it.
L332123	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can we chance moving him?
L331909	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah.
L331908	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dino droppings?
L331874	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331873	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331871	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Unpredictability....
L331869	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, imperfections?
L331867	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, listen to this.
L331865	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anti-nature.
L331734	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It's anti-nature.
L331733	u6163	m411	ELLIE	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And scary.
L331731	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And scary.
L331730	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I know, it's very exciting.
L331729	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I get ah - -
L331728	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That's right.  Will break through.
L331639	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No.
L331536	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Why not?
L331534	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533	u6164	m411	GENNARO	If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526	u6164	m411	GENNARO	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He sends his apologies.
L331524	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What's this I hear at the airport? Hammond's not even here?
L331523	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hola, bienvenido
L331522	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hola, Juanito
L332023	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022	u6173	m411	TIM	Yeah.
L332021	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Are they heavy?
L332020	u6173	m411	TIM	In a box under my seat.
L332019	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015	u6173	m411	TIM	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013	u6173	m411	TIM	Up and down, up and down!
L331829	u6173	m411	TIM	Dilophosaurus.
L331828	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What are we looking for?
L331827	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't see.
L331799	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Thank you.
L331784	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761	u6164	m411	GENNARO	And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700	u6164	m411	GENNARO	John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
L331688	u6164	m411	GENNARO	This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
L331645	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
L331644	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
L331643	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
L331642	u6164	m411	GENNARO	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
L332330	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
L332329	u6173	m411	TIM	Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
L332325	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
L332324	u6173	m411	TIM	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
L332323	u6165	m411	GRANT	Go, go, go, jump!
L332320	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
L332319	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't!  I'm scared!
L332290	u6173	m411	TIM	Nope.
L332289	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
L332216	u6165	m411	GRANT	Amphibian DNA.
L332215	u6173	m411	TIM	But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
L332214	u6165	m411	GRANT	You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
L332201	u6165	m411	GRANT	This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
L332200	u6173	m411	TIM	It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
L332199	u6165	m411	GRANT	Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
L332198	u6173	m411	TIM	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
L332197	u6165	m411	GRANT	Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
L332177	u6173	m411	TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
L332176	u6165	m411	GRANT	You got me.
L332175	u6173	m411	TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
L332174	u6165	m411	GRANT	I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332173	u6173	m411	TIM	What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332170	u6165	m411	GRANT	Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
L332169	u6173	m411	TIM	Straight-A brainiac!
L332160	u6173	m411	TIM	Thunder lizard!
L332159	u6165	m411	GRANT	"It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means ""thunder lizard""."
L332107	u6165	m411	GRANT	Maybe -- it's hard to say.
L332106	u6173	m411	TIM	I doubt it.

L332104	u6173	m411	TIM	That's a good idea.
L332103	u6165	m411	GRANT	'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.

L332099	u6165	m411	GRANT	So am I going to help you with your foot?
L332098	u6173	m411	TIM	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.

L332096	u6173	m411	TIM	No.
L332095	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

L332372	u6165	m411	GRANT	Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
L331789	u6165	m411	GRANT	"What does he mean by ""target audience""?"
L331788	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
L331787	u6165	m411	GRANT	Who?
L331786	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ah - - they're here.

L331694	u6165	m411	GRANT	Can't you stop these things?!
L331657	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
L331654	u6165	m411	GRANT	That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
L331612	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	For a further three years.
L331611	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609	u6165	m411	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of opinions?
L331603	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602	u6165	m411	GRANT	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
L331601	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?

L332218	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!

L332052	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim!  Lex!
L332255	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"Wait a minute?  What do you mean ""worked""?  Everything is still off!"
L332254	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have ""thinktelligence.""  You think narrowly and call it ""being focused.""  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions."
L332243	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Your silence intrigues me.
L331637	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Don't do that!
L331635	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, John.
L331634	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
L331633	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Thanks, Dad.
L331843	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840	u6171	m411	NEDRY	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sure.
L332078	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070	u6170	m411	MULDOON	There's no sign of him anywhere.
L332069	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well?
L331915	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Thanks, Steve.
L331914	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Tell them when they get back to the cars.
L331913	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sustain winds 45 knots.
L331820	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ray, start the tour program.
L331819	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
L331818	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Why didn't I build in Orlando?
L332332	u6173	m411	TIM	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

L333033	u6182	m413	ANNA	Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
L333032	u6190	m413	KAFKA	A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
L333031	u6182	m413	ANNA	What is it really?
L333030	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
L333028	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Up there.
L333027	u6182	m413	ANNA	Where do you live?
L333001	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You have been hearing the sordid side then.
L333000	u6182	m413	ANNA	You work in the insurance department?
L332992	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
L332991	u6182	m413	ANNA	-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
L333215	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What was the matter with it?
L333214	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Fine -- terrible.
L333125	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
L333124	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Have you worked here long?
L333123	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Yes -- we do.
L333122	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You look like brothers.
L333118	u6183	m413	ASSISTANTS	Yes -- that's us.
L333117	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My assistants, I presume.
L333305	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
L333304	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
L333302	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	-- Small.
L333301	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
L333201	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
L333200	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Merely in the interests of order.
L333183	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
L333182	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
L333167	u6184	m413	BEARDED ANARCHIST	You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
L333166	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
L333440	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
L333439	u6190	m413	KAFKA	A true friend would do it.
L333438	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Then its authority is in doubt.
L333437	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's my last and final one.
L333436	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	What an extraordinary request!
L333435	u6190	m413	KAFKA	If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
L333434	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Another one?
L333433	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Will you do me a favor then?
L333432	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Yes.
L333431	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You appreciate my writing.
L333430	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
L333429	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
L333428	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
L333427	u6190	m413	KAFKA	An empty tomb?
L333426	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
L333425	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	In a manner of speaking.
L333424	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
L333423	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
L333422	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
L333421	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
L333420	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
L333419	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
L333418	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
L333415	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
L333414	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	A man must eat --  And drink.
L333413	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You work in the cemetery.
L333296	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
L333295	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Success or nothing?
L333294	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
L333293	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
L333292	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
L333291	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
L333290	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
L333289	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
L333287	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	-- In what sense?
L333286	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
L333044	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
L333043	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Did you?
L333042	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I read the one about the penal colony.
L333041	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- In magazines nobody reads.
L333040	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	Just what you've published.
L333039	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't know what you could have read.
L333038	u6185	m413	BIZZLEBEK	I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
L333233	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.
L333232	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
L332959	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'll commit that to memory.
L332958	u6186	m413	BURGEL	When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
L332957	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
L332956	u6186	m413	BURGEL	But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
L332955	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
L332954	u6186	m413	BURGEL	In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
L332953	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
L332952	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
L332951	u6186	m413	BURGEL	He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
L332950	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
L332949	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Did you see him?
L332948	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I left it in his office.
L332947	u6186	m413	BURGEL	You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
L332946	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I gave it to him yesterday.
L332945	u6186	m413	BURGEL	The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
L333116	u6186	m413	BURGEL	And you're late!
L333115	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're detestable.
L333114	u6186	m413	BURGEL	It's what I'm paid to do.
L333113	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're just doing your job.
L333112	u6186	m413	BURGEL	It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
L333111	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
L333110	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
L333109	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
L333108	u6186	m413	BURGEL	Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
L333345	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
L333344	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
L333343	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
L333342	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
L333341	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
L333340	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Was there something else?
L333338	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
L333337	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	I do.
L333336	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
L333107	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
L333106	u6190	m413	KAFKA	In a small way.
L333105	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	I understand you fancy yourself an author.
L333101	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
L333100	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Eduard --
L333099	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
L333098	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well, I --
L333097	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
L333096	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, sir.
L333095	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
L333094	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I did not realize it was obligatory.
L333093	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
L333092	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I usually take lunch by the River.
L333091	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
L333090	u6190	m413	KAFKA	To do my work well, I have little time for --
L333089	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
L333088	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... My ... social situation?
L333087	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
L333086	u6187	m413	CHIEF CLERK	Sit down, Kafka.
L333085	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You wanted to see me, sir.
L333516	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
L333515	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Listen to me --
L333514	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
L333513	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No -- not this time.
L333512	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
L333511	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
L333510	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
L333509	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
L333508	u6190	m413	KAFKA	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
L333507	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
L333506	u6190	m413	KAFKA	They're dead now.  We can get help.
L333505	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
L333504	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I -- I found your jailer.
L333503	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
L333501	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
L333500	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela ...?
L333499	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
L333498	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
L333497	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
L333496	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Gabriela! -- you did get away.
L333262	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
L333261	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
L333260	u6190	m413	KAFKA	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
L333259	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
L333258	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Usually.
L333257	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
L333256	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've heard of it happening.
L333255	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
L333254	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
L333253	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
L333252	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
L333251	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
L333250	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel doesn't like anybody!
L333249	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
L333248	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
L333247	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
L333246	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
L333245	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
L333242	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I wouldn't put it past him.
L333241	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You don't believe that.
L333240	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
L333239	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
L333238	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	They're not obliged to tell.
L333237	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Why were you given notice?
L333236	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
L333235	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
L333234	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
L333209	u6190	m413	KAFKA	At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
L333208	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	"Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives."
L333207	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
L333206	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
L333197	u6190	m413	KAFKA	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
L333196	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
L333195	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
L333194	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
L333190	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He was murdered.
L333189	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
L333186	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
L333185	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What of it?
L333184	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
L333177	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
L333176	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
L333175	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
L333169	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
L333168	u6190	m413	KAFKA	"Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of."
L333161	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You won't have any trouble finding it.
L333160	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- I don't know the Musil district.
L333159	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
L333158	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And you ...?
L333157	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Eduard wanted to marry me.
L333156	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
L333155	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	You almost married recently, didn't you?
L333154	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... All right.
L333153	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
L333152	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Tonight?
L333151	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Are you free tonight?
L333150	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- What could he have done to warrant that?
L333149	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
L333148	u6190	m413	KAFKA	When I have no reason to doubt.
L333147	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
L333146	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
L333145	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
L333144	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
L333143	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
L333142	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
L333140	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
L333139	u6190	m413	KAFKA	How long were you and Eduard --
L333138	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
L333137	u6190	m413	KAFKA	This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
L333136	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What's funny?
L333135	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
L333134	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
L333133	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	What?
L333132	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I suspected that he -- well.
L333131	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
L333130	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No.
L333129	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
L333023	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Yes.
L333022	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
L333021	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Have you looked?
L333020	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I've never seen you here before.
L333019	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Hello again.
L332980	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
L332979	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
L332978	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	One of you must be mistaken.
L332977	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
L332976	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	Why would you suppose so?
L332975	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
L332974	u6188	m413	GABRIELA	I know.
L332973	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
L333280	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
L333279	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	What did she say?
L333278	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Maybe it's true then what she said.
L333276	u6190	m413	KAFKA	She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
L333275	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
L333274	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
L333272	u6190	m413	KAFKA	If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
L333271	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
L333270	u6190	m413	KAFKA	But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
L333084	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
L333083	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I'll bear that in mind.
L333082	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
L333081	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Probably not.
L333079	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... Just a perception.
L333078	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	What makes you think so?
L333077	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He wasn't a lonely man, though.
L333076	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	We know that.
L333075	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
L333074	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
L333073	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Can I ask -- how you found me?
L333072	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
L333071	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, I suppose not.
L333070	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
L333069	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
L333068	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Was he depressed?
L333067	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I don't know.
L333066	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
L333065	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
L333064	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
L333063	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Well -- other departments are, yes.
L333062	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
L333061	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Eight -- and seven months.
L333060	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Where you've been employed for seven years.
L333059	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- Accident and Compensation Association.
L333058	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Your office is the Workmen's --
L333057	u6190	m413	KAFKA	No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
L333056	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
L333055	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Wednesday.  We left the office together.
L333054	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
L333053	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
L333052	u6189	m413	INSPECTOR	Kafka -- is that your real name?
L333407	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
L333406	u6190	m413	KAFKA	My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
L333405	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Close only by virtue of antithesis.
L333404	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
L333401	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's a farce.
L333400	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- Just doing our job.
L333399	u6190	m413	KAFKA	For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
L333380	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You should meet my father.
L333379	u6194	m413	OSKAR	I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
L333378	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What's the matter with you?
L333373	u6190	m413	KAFKA	You mean you've actually begun some?
L333372	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- I was just trying to finish some work!
L333224	u6194	m413	OSKAR	You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
L333223	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
L333220	u6194	m413	OSKAR	We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
L333219	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Do you?
L333320	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
L333319	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
L333318	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
L333315	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Then why haven't I been --
L333314	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
L333311	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
L333310	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
L333309	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
L333308	u6190	m413	KAFKA	That's <u>mad</u>.
L333174	u6195	m413	POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
L333173	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... Why take me into your confidence?
L333487	u6193	m413	MURNAU	As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
L333486	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
L333485	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
L333482	u6193	m413	MURNAU	On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
L333481	u6190	m413	KAFKA	The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
L333478	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Lying in the gutter where they belong.
L333477	u6193	m413	MURNAU	May I ask where your two warders are?
L333475	u6193	m413	MURNAU	Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
L333474	u6190	m413	KAFKA	And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
L333472	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
L333471	u6193	m413	MURNAU	I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
L333470	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Accident and Compensation -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
L333469	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
L333467	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
L333466	u6193	m413	MURNAU	-- You seem amused.
L333465	u6193	m413	MURNAU	You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
L333464	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
L333463	u6193	m413	MURNAU	Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
L333462	u6193	m413	MURNAU	A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
L333461	u6190	m413	KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
L333370	u6191	m413	KEEPER	It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
L333369	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I could always apply there.
L333368	u6191	m413	KEEPER	We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
L333367	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Where do our records go to in the Castle?
L333366	u6191	m413	KEEPER	You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
L333365	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
L333364	u6191	m413	KEEPER	These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
L333363	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
L333362	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
L333361	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
L333360	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
L333359	u6190	m413	KAFKA	This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
L333358	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
L333357	u6190	m413	KAFKA	I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
L333356	u6191	m413	KEEPER	You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
L333355	u6190	m413	KAFKA	All these in the last year?
L333352	u6191	m413	KEEPER	It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
L333351	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Orlac is an account?
L333350	u6191	m413	KEEPER	If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
L333335	u6190	m413	KAFKA	-- You mean my Chief has it.
L333334	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
L333333	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It's gone out so quickly?
L333332	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
L333331	u6190	m413	KAFKA	What's the matter?
L333330	u6190	m413	KAFKA	He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
L333329	u6191	m413	KEEPER	"Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?"
L333328	u6190	m413	KAFKA	Yes.  Isn't it there?
L333327	u6191	m413	KEEPER	"I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?"
L333326	u6191	m413	KEEPER	I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
L333325	u6190	m413	KAFKA	It usually is.
L333324	u6191	m413	KEEPER	Raban -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
L333530	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Amerika!
L333529	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Amerika for us!
L333528	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Then that's the place for us!
L333525	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	What's to become of us now?
L333524	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
L333523	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	I understand he was wounded in the lung.
L333522	u6194	m413	OSKAR	They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
L333521	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
L333495	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
L333494	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	This is filed incorrectly!
L333493	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Ludwig?
L333492	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Oskar!
L333411	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
L333410	u6194	m413	OSKAR	But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
L333382	u6194	m413	OSKAR	-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
L333381	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
L333377	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	And we're upset too.
L333376	u6194	m413	OSKAR	It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
L333227	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	It's not too bad working here.
L333226	u6194	m413	OSKAR	We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
L333225	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
L333222	u6194	m413	OSKAR	She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
L333221	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Women are all you have on your mind!
L333218	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
L333217	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	You look tired.
L333216	u6194	m413	OSKAR	He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
L333121	u6194	m413	OSKAR	Oskar.
L333120	u6192	m413	LUDWIG	Ludwig.
L347669	u6289	m421	BECK	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
L347668	u6293	m421	DOC	Be careful with it.
L347660	u6293	m421	DOC	Intelligence may not be the right word...
L347659	u6289	m421	BECK	That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
L347591	u6289	m421	BECK	Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
L347590	u6293	m421	DOC	Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
L347589	u6289	m421	BECK	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
L347588	u6293	m421	DOC	Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
L347587	u6293	m421	DOC	It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
L347586	u6289	m421	BECK	Not exactly a big ocean country.
L347585	u6293	m421	DOC	Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
L347584	u6289	m421	BECK	Was there such a thing?
L347583	u6293	m421	DOC	No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
L347582	u6289	m421	BECK	They found this?
L347484	u6289	m421	BECK	Yeah...right...
L347483	u6293	m421	DOC	It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
L347482	u6289	m421	BECK	Why Sixpack?
L347481	u6293	m421	DOC	And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
L347480	u6289	m421	BECK	And?
L347479	u6293	m421	DOC	I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
L347478	u6289	m421	BECK	The mask is because you think it might be...catching?

L347476	u6289	m421	BECK	I'm not a doctor.
L347475	u6293	m421	DOC	Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
L347474	u6289	m421	BECK	Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
L347473	u6293	m421	DOC	He did.
L347472	u6289	m421	BECK	Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
L347439	u6293	m421	DOC	Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
L347438	u6289	m421	BECK	What's wrong?
L347389	u6289	m421	BECK	What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
L347388	u6293	m421	DOC	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
L347387	u6289	m421	BECK	What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
L347382	u6289	m421	BECK	Be my guest.
L347381	u6293	m421	DOC	You mind if I take a look at this?
L347246	u6289	m421	BECK	We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
L347245	u6293	m421	DOC	Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
L347244	u6289	m421	BECK	Are you planning on working tomorrow?

L347653	u6289	m421	BECK	That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
L347641	u6294	m421	JONES	He did.
L347640	u6289	m421	BECK	No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?

L347299	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
L347233	u6289	m421	BECK	"Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the ""sick rack"" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?"
L347232	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Shit...
L347231	u6289	m421	BECK	Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...

L347796	u6289	m421	BECK	Where's Jones?
L347795	u6297	m421	WILLIE	We made it!
L347728	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Can't we fix it?
L347727	u6289	m421	BECK	Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
L347726	u6297	m421	WILLIE	How much time does that give us?
L347725	u6289	m421	BECK	We're on backup air.
L347719	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Seeing how my stock's doing...
L347718	u6289	m421	BECK	What are you doing?
L347717	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Maybe they already have.
L347716	u6289	m421	BECK	Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
L347715	u6297	m421	WILLIE	They know, don't they?
L347695	u6297	m421	WILLIE	The escape bubbles?
L347694	u6289	m421	BECK	Shit!  He sent them all.
L347666	u6289	m421	BECK	Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
L347665	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What can we do?
L347434	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
L347433	u6289	m421	BECK	I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
L347432	u6297	m421	WILLIE	"Well, I always heard you don't ""learn"" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?"
L347431	u6289	m421	BECK	You think I should hang around more with the crew?
L347429	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Has it helped?
L347428	u6289	m421	BECK	Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
L347427	u6297	m421	WILLIE	I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
L347426	u6289	m421	BECK	Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
L347425	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Good...It's going good.
L347424	u6289	m421	BECK	No.  I'm just being friendly.
L347423	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
L347422	u6289	m421	BECK	How's astronaut training?
L347421	u6297	m421	WILLIE	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
L347420	u6289	m421	BECK	That was a loud one wasn't it?
L347342	u6289	m421	BECK	Why can't we pick up his signal?
L347341	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Sixpack?
L347323	u6297	m421	WILLIE	You screw around like that again and--
L347322	u6289	m421	BECK	That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
L347317	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
L347316	u6289	m421	BECK	I need more light on that, Four.
L347242	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Still...you did the right thing.
L347241	u6289	m421	BECK	There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
L347240	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
L347239	u6289	m421	BECK	What?
L347238	u6297	m421	WILLIE	You did good...
L347629	u6289	m421	BECK	Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
L347628	u6291	m421	COBB	Oh, God, she's out there...
L347564	u6291	m421	COBB	It bit me!
L347563	u6289	m421	BECK	No!
L347553	u6291	m421	COBB	Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---

L347460	u6291	m421	COBB	No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
L347459	u6289	m421	BECK	Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
L347458	u6291	m421	COBB	Excuse me, sir...
L347405	u6289	m421	BECK	All right...
L347404	u6291	m421	COBB	...I'd really have to show it to you.
L347403	u6289	m421	BECK	What's wrong with it?
L347402	u6291	m421	COBB	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
L347401	u6289	m421	BECK	Something wrong, Cobb?
L347229	u6289	m421	BECK	You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
L347228	u6291	m421	COBB	What about our quota?
L347188	u6289	m421	BECK	He's not at his station.
L347187	u6291	m421	COBB	Where's Doc?!
L347186	u6289	m421	BECK	The internal monitors read normal.
L347791	u6298	m421	WILLIE'S VOICE	Roger.
L347790	u6289	m421	BECK	Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
L347352	u6289	m421	BECK	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
L347351	u6298	m421	WILLIE'S VOICE	Twenty minutes...
L347350	u6289	m421	BECK	What's your air reading?
L347349	u6298	m421	WILLIE'S VOICE	I'm going inside.
L347313	u6298	m421	WILLIE'S VOICE	Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
L347312	u6289	m421	BECK	Charge set?
L347542	u6289	m421	BECK	No...she killed herself.
L347541	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	And it killed Bo?
L347540	u6289	m421	BECK	I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
L347465	u6289	m421	BECK	Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
L347464	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Okay, number 23's full.
L347215	u6289	m421	BECK	Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
L347214	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Okay.
L347213	u6289	m421	BECK	How do you feel, DeJesus?
L347181	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Ahhhh!
L347180	u6289	m421	BECK	Give me a readout, DeJesus.
L347710	u6295	m421	MARTIN	I realize you must have gone through hell--
L347709	u6289	m421	BECK	Forty-eight hours!
L347519	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
L347518	u6289	m421	BECK	But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
L347517	u6295	m421	MARTIN	It shouldn't be a long delay.
L347516	u6289	m421	BECK	What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
L347515	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Unfortunately.  We can't.
L347514	u6289	m421	BECK	Do it.
L347513	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
L347512	u6289	m421	BECK	I'm not anxious to find out, either.
L347511	u6295	m421	MARTIN	But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
L347510	u6289	m421	BECK	What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
L347509	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
L347449	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Beautiful.
L347448	u6289	m421	BECK	How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
L347447	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
L347446	u6289	m421	BECK	I know that.
L347445	u6295	m421	MARTIN	...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
L347258	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
L347257	u6289	m421	BECK	Thank you, Martin.
L347256	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
L347255	u6289	m421	BECK	Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
L347365	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Timex...
L347364	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	Personal effects...
L347279	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
L347278	u6297	m421	WILLIE	You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
L347271	u6297	m421	WILLIE	I signed-up for the stock option.
L347270	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	You got money in this tub?
L347269	u6297	m421	WILLIE	How's TransOcean doing?
L347268	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	Not yet.
L347267	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Made your million, yet?
L347467	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	Hook's on 24...

L347408	u6294	m421	JONES	Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
L347407	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
L347355	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
L347354	u6294	m421	JONES	The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
L347353	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	Who else...Sixpack.

L347192	u6294	m421	JONES	Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
L347191	u6290	m421	BOWMAN	I'm telling you, it's the suits!
L347672	u6293	m421	DOC	Take it off and let me have a look.
L347671	u6291	m421	COBB	Itches like hell.
L347670	u6293	m421	DOC	Still bothering you?
L347644	u6291	m421	COBB	What was it?
L347643	u6293	m421	DOC	It...almost got you.
L347642	u6291	m421	COBB	What happened?
L347379	u6293	m421	DOC	...and a Russian grandmother...
L347378	u6291	m421	COBB	Bullshit.
L347377	u6293	m421	DOC	Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
L347376	u6291	m421	COBB	You read Russian?
L347348	u6293	m421	DOC	Russian.
L347347	u6291	m421	COBB	What the?...
L347664	u6294	m421	JONES	And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
L347663	u6291	m421	COBB	I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
L347626	u6294	m421	JONES	That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
L347625	u6291	m421	COBB	I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
L347624	u6294	m421	JONES	You let him get away!
L347614	u6294	m421	JONES	It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
L347613	u6291	m421	COBB	What's going on?
L347548	u6294	m421	JONES	Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
L347547	u6291	m421	COBB	At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
L347487	u6291	m421	COBB	"He didn't say it was a ""routine check-up,"" he said it was a ""routine <u>precaution</u>."""
L347486	u6294	m421	JONES	"Routine, my ass!  Ain't nothin' ""routine"" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!"
L347311	u6291	m421	COBB	Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
L347310	u6294	m421	JONES	Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
L347306	u6291	m421	COBB	What music?  There ain't no music.
L347305	u6294	m421	JONES	Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
L347262	u6291	m421	COBB	Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
L347261	u6294	m421	JONES	So that's all you do?...
L347254	u6291	m421	COBB	Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
L347253	u6294	m421	JONES	Listen to it for Christsake.
L347223	u6294	m421	JONES	Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
L347222	u6291	m421	COBB	No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
L347566	u6291	m421	COBB	I'm going to kill it!
L347565	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	It's Sixpack!
L347556	u6291	m421	COBB	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
L347555	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
L347551	u6291	m421	COBB	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
L347550	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
L347451	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	He's tanking on us...
L347450	u6291	m421	COBB	Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
L347292	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
L347291	u6291	m421	COBB	You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
L347290	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
L347289	u6291	m421	COBB	You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
L347276	u6291	m421	COBB	This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
L347275	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
L347274	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
L347273	u6291	m421	COBB	Who cares?
L347272	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
L347604	u6294	m421	JONES	Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
L347603	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Look.  Water.
L347602	u6294	m421	JONES	Under there?
L347601	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Getting some food.
L347580	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
L347579	u6294	m421	JONES	How'd you do that?
L347570	u6294	m421	JONES	'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
L347569	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
L347546	u6294	m421	JONES	Twelve hours!
L347545	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Typhoon?!
L347164	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
L347163	u6294	m421	JONES	Burritos...Enchiladas...
L347662	u6293	m421	DOC	I don't know.  I'm guessing.
L347661	u6294	m421	JONES	Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
L347657	u6293	m421	DOC	...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
L347656	u6294	m421	JONES	No fuckin' lie...
L347655	u6293	m421	DOC	The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
L347652	u6294	m421	JONES	Like a leech.
L347651	u6293	m421	DOC	It would explain the suction- like appendages.
L347648	u6293	m421	DOC	It's had a meal.
L347647	u6294	m421	JONES	Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
L347622	u6294	m421	JONES	I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
L347621	u6293	m421	DOC	I'm going to try to remove it.
L347620	u6294	m421	JONES	What are you going to do to him?
L347619	u6293	m421	DOC	We've got to get him to the infirmary.
L347533	u6293	m421	DOC	We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
L347532	u6294	m421	JONES	Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
L347531	u6293	m421	DOC	The infirmary?...
L347530	u6294	m421	JONES	Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
L347335	u6293	m421	DOC	Two hundred meters.
L347334	u6294	m421	JONES	How far away is she?
L347810	u6297	m421	WILLIE	I'm not touching you!

L347805	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
L347804	u6294	m421	JONES	Tip top, Willie...tip top.
L347803	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Are you okay, Jonesy?
L347801	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
L347800	u6294	m421	JONES	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
L347799	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Are you sure you saw something?
L347742	u6294	m421	JONES	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
L347741	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Don't spend all day down there.
L347738	u6294	m421	JONES	She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
L347737	u6297	m421	WILLIE	The shack...
L347724	u6294	m421	JONES	The air's stopped.
L347723	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?
L347698	u6294	m421	JONES	The good doctor signed our death warrant.
L347697	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?
L347691	u6294	m421	JONES	Oh man, that's just great...
L347690	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...

L347635	u6294	m421	JONES	DeJesus...It's got him.
L347634	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What's wrong?
L347633	u6294	m421	JONES	I ought to smack your face!
L347632	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What on earth's the matter with you?
L347526	u6294	m421	JONES	Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
L347525	u6297	m421	WILLIE	How is he?
L347524	u6294	m421	JONES	Sixpack...
L347523	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Who were you talking to?
L347453	u6294	m421	JONES	"Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about ""whys,"" they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month."
L347452	u6297	m421	WILLIE	No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
L347370	u6294	m421	JONES	Debbie Does Dallas...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
L347369	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?

L347202	u6294	m421	JONES	Let's hope it holds.
L347201	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Clear for pickup.
L347326	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
L347325	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Hardly.
L347324	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	What's wrong, did you miss me?
L347296	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
L347295	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Bitch!  Look what you did!
L347237	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Right.
L347236	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
L347235	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Your pocket?
L347234	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
L373507	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Know what?
L373506	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	You don't know.
L373444	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
L373443	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	They are dead.  In either case --
L372816	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	It's already begun.
L372815	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We'll need a search running.
L372814	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Their next target.  The name is Neo.
L372813	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
L372812	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	He'll be contacting us again.
L372811	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
L372810	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Then the informant is real.
L373358	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You all look the same to me.
L373357	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
L373356	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	And you are?
L373355	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
L373350	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	They won't make it.
L373349	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hurry!
L373348	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The sewers.  Of course.
L372797	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
L372796	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
L372794	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The orders were for your protection.
L372793	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
L372792	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
L372791	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	Oh shit.
L372790	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant?
L373397	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Oh, God.
L373396	u6518	m433	APOC	What?!
L373310	u6518	m433	APOC	Should Tank I.D. it?
L373309	u6525	m433	SWITCH	That's the third white van I've seen.
L373308	u6518	m433	APOC	What?
L373307	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Weird.
L373109	u6518	m433	APOC	No way.  Not possible.
L373108	u6525	m433	SWITCH	He's gonna make it.
L372833	u6519	m433	CHOI	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
L372832	u6523	m433	NEO	You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
L372831	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know... My computer...
L372830	u6519	m433	CHOI	Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
L372829	u6523	m433	NEO	Right...
L372828	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
L372827	u6523	m433	NEO	If you get caught using that --
L372826	u6519	m433	CHOI	Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
L372824	u6519	m433	CHOI	Two grand.
L372823	u6523	m433	NEO	You got the money?
L372822	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know.  It's her fault.
L372821	u6523	m433	NEO	You're two hours late.
L372820	u6519	m433	CHOI	It's Choi.
L372819	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is it?
L373413	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No!
L373412	u6527	m433	TRINITY	... yes.
L373408	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
L373407	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamn you, Cypher!
L373405	u6520	m433	CYPHER	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
L373404	u6527	m433	TRINITY	But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
L373402	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
L373401	u6527	m433	TRINITY	The Matrix isn't real!
L373400	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
L373399	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
L373398	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
L373395	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You killed them.
L373394	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
L373392	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An accident?!
L373391	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He had an accident.
L373390	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher?  Where's Tank?
L373389	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hello, Trinity.
L373128	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
L373127	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
L373126	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't tell me you're a believer now?
L373125	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There's something about him, isn't there?
L372786	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
L372785	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you sure this line is clean?
L372784	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hear what?
L372783	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Did you hear that?
L372782	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
L372781	u6527	m433	TRINITY	If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
L372780	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You don't, do you?
L372779	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
L372778	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Do you?
L372777	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus believes he is the One.
L372776	u6520	m433	CYPHER	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
L372775	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't be ridiculous.
L372773	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
L372772	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You weren't supposed to relieve me.
L373187	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Any time.
L373186	u6523	m433	NEO	Thanks... for the drink.
L373184	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
L373183	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373182	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Dead.  All dead.
L373181	u6523	m433	NEO	What happened to them?
L373180	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Five.  Since I've been here.
L373179	u6523	m433	NEO	How many were there?
L373178	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
L373177	u6523	m433	NEO	Really?
L373176	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
L373175	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
L373174	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yeah.
L373173	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Why you're here?
L373168	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
L373167	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you always look at it encoded?
L373166	u6520	m433	CYPHER	The Matrix?  Yeah.
L373165	u6523	m433	NEO	Is that...?
L373164	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Midnight watch.
L373163	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373162	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No, it's all right.
L373161	u6523	m433	NEO	Sorry.
L373160	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
L373057	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He's going to pop!
L373056	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
L373370	u6526	m433	TANK	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
L373369	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Just get me outta here.
L373368	u6526	m433	TANK	I got you.
L373367	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
L373366	u6526	m433	TANK	Cypher?
L373365	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I need an exit!  Fast!
L373364	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373589	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
L373588	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't use that until Neo is out!
L373585	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
L373584	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How long?
L373569	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He's beginning to believe.
L373568	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What is he doing?
L373333	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have no choice.
L373332	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They'll be able to track it.
L373331	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Give me your phone.
L373007	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
L373006	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
L373000	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Shit!  Apoc?
L372999	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I got a fibrillation!
L372807	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go.
L372806	u6527	m433	TRINITY	All right --
L372805	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
L372804	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!
L372803	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372802	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are they any agent?
L372801	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
L373544	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
L373543	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
L373347	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
L373346	u6523	m433	NEO	No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
L373250	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
L373249	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, I don't know --
L373248	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
L373245	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
L373244	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you believe in them too?
L373243	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
L373242	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes I do.
L373241	u6523	m433	NEO	And you still believe I'm the One?
L373240	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
L373239	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
L373238	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That's why we're here.
L373237	u6523	m433	NEO	What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
L373236	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What do you believe in?
L373235	u6523	m433	NEO	I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
L373234	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why?
L373233	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
L373231	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That I would find the One.
L373230	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373229	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L373228	u6523	m433	NEO	She helped you?
L373227	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
L373226	u6523	m433	NEO	And she's never wrong.
L373225	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
L373224	u6523	m433	NEO	How does she know?
L373223	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She would say she knows enough.
L373222	u6523	m433	NEO	And she knows what?  Everything?
L373221	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Of the Resistance.
L373220	u6523	m433	NEO	The beginning?
L373219	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
L373218	u6523	m433	NEO	So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
L373149	u6523	m433	NEO	What's going on?
L373148	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Set down in there.
L373144	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
L373143	u6523	m433	NEO	What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
L373142	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
L373141	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373140	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
L373137	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Look again.
L373136	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373135	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
L373134	u6523	m433	NEO	I think I do.
L373133	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you understand, Neo?
L373130	u6523	m433	NEO	What -- what lesson?
L373129	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
L373122	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The body cannot live without the mind.
L373121	u6523	m433	NEO	If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
L373120	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your mind makes it real.
L373119	u6523	m433	NEO	I thought it wasn't real.
L373115	u6523	m433	NEO	Because... I didn't think I would?
L373114	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you know why you didn't make it?
L373104	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
L373103	u6523	m433	NEO	I know what you're trying to do --
L373096	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
L373095	u6523	m433	NEO	You -- you're too fast.
L373094	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How did I beat you?
L373089	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Show me.
L373088	u6523	m433	NEO	This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
L373066	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your training.
L373065	u6523	m433	NEO	For what?
L373064	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
L373051	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
L373050	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
L373042	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
L373041	u6523	m433	NEO	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
L373040	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
L373035	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
L373034	u6523	m433	NEO	This isn't real?
L373033	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Wild, isn't it?
L373032	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now, we're inside a computer program?
L373020	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
L373019	u6523	m433	NEO	When?
L373018	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	More important than what is when?
L373017	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
L373015	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You've never used them before.
L373014	u6523	m433	NEO	Why do my eyes hurt?
L373013	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
L373012	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373009	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Far from it.
L373008	u6523	m433	NEO	... am I dead?
L372990	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Be what?  Be real?
L372989	u6523	m433	NEO	This can't be...
L372988	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
L372985	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L372984	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
L372974	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
L372973	u6523	m433	NEO	What truth?
L372972	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
L372971	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you want to know what it is?
L372970	u6523	m433	NEO	The Matrix?
L372969	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L372968	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know exactly what you mean.
L372967	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
L372966	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why not?
L372965	u6523	m433	NEO	No.
L372964	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
L372963	u6523	m433	NEO	You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
L372962	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
L372961	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
L372960	u6523	m433	NEO	You could say that.
L372959	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
L372957	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Please.  Come.  Sit.
L372956	u6523	m433	NEO	It's an honor.
L372955	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
L372929	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go the the Adams Street bridge.
L372928	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yes.
L372927	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you still want to meet?
L372926	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
L372925	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you know?
L372924	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
L372923	u6523	m433	NEO	The agents --
L372922	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This line is tapped so I must be brief.
L372902	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
L372901	u6523	m433	NEO	No way, no way, this is crazy.
L372900	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
L372899	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  It's too far away.
L372896	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know all this?
L372895	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
L372890	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go!  Now!
L372889	u6523	m433	NEO	But what if...?
L372888	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The cubicle across from you is empty.
L372887	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
L372886	u6523	m433	NEO	How?!
L372885	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
L372884	u6523	m433	NEO	What the fuck do they want with me?!
L372883	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372882	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy fucking shit!
L372880	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Now.
L372879	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now?
L372878	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Stand up and see for yourself.
L372877	u6523	m433	NEO	Who's coming for me?
L372876	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
L372875	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus...
L372874	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
L372873	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373630	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He is the One.  He is the One!
L373629	u6526	m433	TANK	How...?!
L373615	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do it!
L373614	u6526	m433	TANK	I'm going to make the call.
L373587	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes, sir.
L373586	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank, charge the E.M.P.
L373549	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We're on our way --
L373548	u6526	m433	TANK	Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
L373547	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We need an exit.
L373546	u6526	m433	TANK	Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
L373545	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank.
L373338	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.
L373337	u6526	m433	TANK	Now left and that's it in front of you.
L373336	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I need the main wet-wall.
L373335	u6526	m433	TANK	Got it.
L373087	u6526	m433	TANK	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
L373086	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How is he?
L373299	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
L373298	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373297	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
L373295	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you mean, without him?
L373294	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
L373293	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
L373292	u6524	m433	ORACLE	What's funny?
L373291	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
L373290	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373289	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
L373288	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One.
L373287	u6524	m433	ORACLE	But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
L373286	u6523	m433	NEO	But what?
L373285	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
L373281	u6523	m433	NEO	Honestly?  I don't know.
L373280	u6524	m433	ORACLE	So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
L373278	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Not too bright though.
L373277	u6523	m433	NEO	Who?
L373276	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
L373274	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you know...?
L373273	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
L373272	u6523	m433	NEO	Shit, I'm sorry.
L373271	u6524	m433	ORACLE	That vase.
L373270	u6523	m433	NEO	What vase?
L373269	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
L373268	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373267	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
L373266	u6523	m433	NEO	You're the Oracle?
L373265	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
L373264	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373525	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Not yet.
L373524	u6523	m433	NEO	Can you fly that thing.
L373523	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
L373522	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373521	u6523	m433	NEO	It wasn't fast enough.
L373520	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
L373519	u6523	m433	NEO	Do what?
L373518	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo, how did you do that?
L373490	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?
L373489	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No one has ever done anything like this.
L373481	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
L373480	u6523	m433	NEO	No, you're not.
L373479	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I'm coming with you.
L373478	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373477	u6523	m433	NEO	I believe I can bring him back.
L373476	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373471	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because...
L373470	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L373469	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
L373468	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
L373467	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No, you... have to be.
L373466	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
L373465	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373464	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
L373463	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
L373462	u6523	m433	NEO	I have to.
L373461	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't!
L373460	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm going in after him.
L373459	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What are you doing?
L373458	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What choice?
L373457	u6523	m433	NEO	That I would have to make a choice...
L373446	u6523	m433	NEO	There has to be something that we can do.
L373445	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
L373388	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know.  It just went dead.
L373387	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?
L373374	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
L373373	u6523	m433	NEO	Is Morpheus alive?
L373353	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We have to!
L373352	u6523	m433	NEO	We can't leave him!
L373351	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Go!
L373324	u6527	m433	TRINITY	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
L373323	u6523	m433	NEO	What is it?
L373322	u6523	m433	NEO	It might have been.  I'm not sure.
L373321	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
L373320	u6523	m433	NEO	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
L373319	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?  What did you see?
L373318	u6523	m433	NEO	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
L373317	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What did you just say?
L373306	u6523	m433	NEO	... right as rain.
L373305	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373214	u6527	m433	TRINITY	She told me...
L373213	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373212	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Yes.
L373211	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you go to her?
L373210	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.
L373209	u6523	m433	NEO	Should I be?
L373208	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you worried?
L373207	u6523	m433	NEO	Is it?
L373206	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That's different.
L373205	u6523	m433	NEO	But an Oracle can.
L373204	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
L373203	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L373201	u6523	m433	NEO	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
L373200	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373199	u6523	m433	NEO	God...
L373158	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
L373157	u6523	m433	NEO	E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
L373054	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Easy, Neo.  Easy.
L373053	u6523	m433	NEO	Get this thing out of me!
L372993	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's going into replication.
L372992	u6523	m433	NEO	Uh-oh...
L372948	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
L372947	u6523	m433	NEO	What is this thing?
L372945	u6523	m433	NEO	... shit.
L372944	u6527	m433	TRINITY	And I know that's not where you want to be.
L372943	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
L372942	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L372941	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo, please, you have to trust me.
L372934	u6527	m433	TRINITY	From you.
L372933	u6523	m433	NEO	From what?
L372932	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
L372931	u6523	m433	NEO	What the hell is this?!
L372862	u6527	m433	TRINITY	When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
L372861	u6523	m433	NEO	What is the Matrix?
L372860	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
L372858	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
L372857	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is?
L372856	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They're watching you, Neo.
L372855	u6523	m433	NEO	Of what?
L372854	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
L372853	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you do that?
L372851	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
L372850	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
L372849	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Most guys do.
L372848	u6523	m433	NEO	I just thought... you were a guy.
L372847	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L372846	u6523	m433	NEO	Gee-zus.
L372845	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That was a long time ago.
L372844	u6523	m433	NEO	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
L372843	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My name is Trinity.
L372842	u6523	m433	NEO	Who are you?
L372841	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
L372840	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know that name?
L372839	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hello, Neo.
L373606	u6526	m433	TANK	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
L373605	u6523	m433	NEO	It's locked.
L373598	u6526	m433	TANK	Duck!
L373597	u6523	m433	NEO	Which way?  Which way?
L373592	u6523	m433	NEO	Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
L373591	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373488	u6523	m433	NEO	Guns.  Lots of guns.
L373487	u6526	m433	TANK	Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
L373475	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I believe in something.
L373474	u6526	m433	TANK	Why?
L373473	u6523	m433	NEO	I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
L373472	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
L373456	u6523	m433	NEO	The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
L373455	u6526	m433	TANK	What are you talking about?
L373454	u6523	m433	NEO	Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
L373453	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo, this has to be done!
L373452	u6523	m433	NEO	Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
L373439	u6526	m433	TANK	Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
L373438	u6523	m433	NEO	What do they want?
L373437	u6526	m433	TANK	When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
L373436	u6526	m433	TANK	Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
L373435	u6523	m433	NEO	How much time?
L373434	u6526	m433	TANK	They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
L373433	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373432	u6526	m433	TANK	They're hacking his mind.
L373431	u6523	m433	NEO	What are they doing to him?
L373196	u6526	m433	TANK	The Oracle.
L373195	u6523	m433	NEO	See who?
L373085	u6523	m433	NEO	Hell yes!
L373084	u6526	m433	TANK	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
L373083	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy shit!
L373077	u6526	m433	TANK	Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
L373076	u6523	m433	NEO	Where is it?
L373075	u6526	m433	TANK	The last human city.  The only place we got left.
L373074	u6523	m433	NEO	It's a city?
L373073	u6526	m433	TANK	If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
L373072	u6523	m433	NEO	Zion?
L373071	u6526	m433	TANK	Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
L373070	u6523	m433	NEO	You don't have...
L373069	u6526	m433	TANK	You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
L373068	u6523	m433	NEO	No.
L373067	u6526	m433	TANK	Morning.  Did you sleep?
L373620	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hurry, Neo.
L373619	u6526	m433	TANK	They've burned through the outer shields.
L373580	u6526	m433	TANK	I don't know.  I lost him.
L373579	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What just happened?
L373565	u6526	m433	TANK	I can't!
L373564	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An Agent!  You have to send me back!
L373563	u6526	m433	TANK	What the hell just happened?
L373562	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo!
L373527	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
L373526	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373449	u6526	m433	TANK	Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
L373448	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
L373447	u6526	m433	TANK	There is.  We have to pull the plug.
L373419	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Dozer?
L373418	u6526	m433	TANK	I'll be all right.
L373417	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, you're hurt.
L373381	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Got it.
L373380	u6526	m433	TANK	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
L373379	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher, I thought --
L373378	u6526	m433	TANK	You're not far from Cypher.
L373377	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We need an exit!
L373376	u6527	m433	TRINITY	He's alive.
L373375	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
L373372	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, it's me.
L373371	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L374319	u6528	m434	BOY	Let go of her.
L374318	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
L374316	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing's private...
L374315	u6528	m434	BOY	Look fella...this is private...
L374314	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
L374210	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
L374209	u6528	m434	BOY	Sounds good.
L374208	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
L374207	u6528	m434	BOY	Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
L374206	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What are your plans?
L374205	u6528	m434	BOY	Thanks.
L374204	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
L373956	u6528	m434	BOY	Follow me.
L373955	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Know where he is?
L373954	u6528	m434	BOY	Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
L373953	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
L374020	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
L374019	u6529	m434	BOY #1	Riverdale.
L374007	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You sure?
L374006	u6529	m434	BOY #1	No, all we got is $40.
L374002	u6529	m434	BOY #1	You got sparklers?
L374001	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	That means it's good.
L374000	u6529	m434	BOY #1	No.
L373997	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
L373996	u6529	m434	BOY #1	Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
L373993	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
L373992	u6529	m434	BOY #1	We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
L374005	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
L374004	u6530	m434	BOY #2	And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
L374003	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah.
L373999	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
L373998	u6530	m434	BOY #2	Well, we want good stuff.
L373995	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
L373994	u6530	m434	BOY #2	Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
L373991	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
L373990	u6530	m434	BOY #2	Well the guy over there said...
L373989	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
L374018	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
L374017	u6531	m434	BOYS	Uh...can we give you a check?
L374016	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
L374015	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
L374014	u6531	m434	BOYS	Can't we come with you?
L374013	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I gotta get the stuff.
L374012	u6531	m434	BOYS	Why?
L374011	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
L374009	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok.  Wait here.
L374008	u6531	m434	BOYS	Yeah.
L374379	u6543	m434	TONY	Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
L374378	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
L374377	u6543	m434	TONY	Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
L374376	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Panther!  Same thing...
L374375	u6543	m434	TONY	Panther...
L374373	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Thanks for the ride.
L374372	u6543	m434	TONY	Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
L374371	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll say that I'm travelling.
L374370	u6543	m434	TONY	And say what?
L374369	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
L374368	u6543	m434	TONY	How about Teresa?  I could talk...
L374367	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
L374366	u6543	m434	TONY	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
L374365	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hey, come on...
L374364	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374363	u6543	m434	TONY	You flew before?
L374362	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah.

L374360	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
L374359	u6543	m434	TONY	So?
L374358	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
L374357	u6543	m434	TONY	I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
L374356	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Kennedy.
L374355	u6543	m434	TONY	Where to?
L374338	u6543	m434	TONY	Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
L374337	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
L374336	u6543	m434	TONY	Get out of here before this really goes up.
L374304	u6543	m434	TONY	Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
L374303	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	She don't look Jewish.
L374302	u6543	m434	TONY	Look at her.
L374301	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How do you know?
L374300	u6543	m434	TONY	Jewish...
L374299	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who's the girl?
L374054	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
L374053	u6543	m434	TONY	Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
L374051	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
L374050	u6543	m434	TONY	'Thou art then a king?'
L374049	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
L374047	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
L374046	u6543	m434	TONY	'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
L374045	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Salute!!!
L374044	u6543	m434	TONY	'And with your spirit.'
L374043	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	May God be with you.
L373766	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Anybody wanna have a game?
L373765	u6543	m434	TONY	No.
L373755	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
L373754	u6543	m434	TONY	You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
L373753	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
L373746	u6543	m434	TONY	'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
L373745	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
L373742	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Be careful.
L373741	u6543	m434	TONY	Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
L373740	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
L373739	u6543	m434	TONY	Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
L374200	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
L374199	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You got some mouth!
L374165	u6535	m434	JIMMY	I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
L374164	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
L374163	u6535	m434	JIMMY	The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
L374162	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Next time, bet with your own kind.
L373761	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not quite...but keep trying.
L373760	u6535	m434	JIMMY	Waddaya think?
L374344	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Good idea.
L374343	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What are you going to do?  Hide me?
L374342	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Forget it.
L374341	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
L374340	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L374339	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I think we should see your uncle.
L374324	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
L374323	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
L374296	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Mind your own business.
L374295	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Back so soon.
L374289	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'll be here.  Don't worry.
L374288	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't you move!!!
L374285	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Come on.
L374284	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
L374283	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
L374282	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
L374281	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, cut it out, will ya?
L374280	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	No you're not...
L374279	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
L374274	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
L374273	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
L374262	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
L374261	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
L374257	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
L374256	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't be smart.
L374255	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
L374254	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
L374253	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
L374251	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
L374250	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Shut up!
L374184	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	You tell me that in front of these creeps?
L374183	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Keep your mouth shut.
L374099	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I understand.
L374098	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
L374097	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
L374096	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
L374095	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
L374094	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
L374093	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How?
L374092	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
L374091	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
L374090	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
L374089	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
L374088	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
L374087	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's not going to help.
L374086	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
L374085	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Did you see them run!
L374084	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Let's get out of here.
L374081	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
L374080	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
L374077	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
L374076	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't come any closer!!!
L373829	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
L373828	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I could have told you that.
L373827	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Hey...you got nothing here.
L373825	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Listen...I'm a guest here.
L373824	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
L373823	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
L373822	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't promise...just deliver.
L373821	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
L373820	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
L373819	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
L373818	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
L373817	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't like loading crates.
L373816	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
L373815	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Didn't show up.
L373814	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do you mean?
L373813	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	There won't be any this week.
L373812	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
L373811	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Don't worry.  I can handle it.
L373810	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
L373809	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Wouldn't bother me.
L373808	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
L373805	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she isn't.
L373804	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
L373775	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Should I slap him?
L373774	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
L373764	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
L373763	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Nah.
L373731	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
L373730	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	It's the truth, I swear.
L373712	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
L373711	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know but let's hear it anyway.
L373710	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
L373709	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What happened to you Flash?
L373698	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Giovanino!  Where have you been?
L373697	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Drinks for everybody Tony...
L373889	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What can I say?
L373888	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
L373887	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
L373886	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I don't understand, where's Groppi?
L373885	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
L373884	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
L373883	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
L373882	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
L373881	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
L373880	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That bad, huh?
L373879	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
L373878	u6540	m434	OSCAR	What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
L373877	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What pipes?
L373876	u6540	m434	OSCAR	I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
L373875	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.
L373874	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
L373873	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, how's everything going?
L373872	u6540	m434	OSCAR	Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?

L374326	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Where's the rest?
L374240	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Whatever.
L374239	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
L374234	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll be here.
L374233	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
L374068	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You said it.
L374067	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
L374066	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
L374065	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
L374064	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
L374063	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
L374062	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Charlie, this is business.
L374061	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
L374060	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
L374059	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	How much was the original loan again?
L374058	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
L374057	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
L374056	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.

L374028	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What's a'matter?
L373982	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	We'll settle it tonight.
L373981	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
L373980	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
L373979	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
L373978	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh Michael, look...

L373800	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You getting out too?
L373799	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	C'mon Johnny.
L373798	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Out!!!!
L373797	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Ok...that's it.
L373796	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Disgraceful.

L373791	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Hey, shut up.
L373769	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK, get in.
L373768	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, give us a lift.
L373695	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	OK.
L373694	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
L373693	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
L373692	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
L373691	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
L373690	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
L373689	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
L373688	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
L373687	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
L373686	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
L373685	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nope...
L373684	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
L373683	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...I'll be ok for a week.
L373682	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
L373681	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	OK, ok...
L373680	u6539	m434	MICHAEL	For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
L373679	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh great...hey - Winstons?
L374232	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bye.
L374231	u6533	m434	DIANE	Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
L374230	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
L374229	u6533	m434	DIANE	Chinese food?
L374228	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
L374227	u6533	m434	DIANE	Hostess?
L374226	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...no stripping...as the hostess.
L374225	u6533	m434	DIANE	Stripper?
L374224	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
L374223	u6533	m434	DIANE	That's nice.
L374222	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
L374221	u6533	m434	DIANE	I know.
L374220	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, I'm serious...You're really good.
L374219	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374218	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
L374217	u6533	m434	DIANE	Fine.
L374216	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Diane, how are you feeling?
L374152	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
L374151	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, maybe you missed something?
L374148	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	All right.
L374147	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	"Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm ""cumpari"" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved."
L374146	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What do they expect you to say?
L374145	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
L374144	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
L374143	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No, she's got epilepsy.
L374142	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
L374141	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa.
L374140	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
L374135	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	What did he do?
L374134	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
L374129	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
L374128	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh yes, he's pretty good.
L374116	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
L374115	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
L374114	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
L374113	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
L373968	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
L373967	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
L373966	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
L373965	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh...around...why?
L373964	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Hey, where you been?
L373963	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok.
L373962	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Take a drink!
L373913	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
L373912	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
L373911	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Yes, you did.
L373910	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
L373909	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	No you weren't.
L373908	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	About that shooting last night...I was there and...
L373907	u6534	m434	GIOVANNI	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
L373906	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uncle, how are you feeling?
L374150	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
L374149	u6538	m434	MARIO	Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
L374131	u6538	m434	MARIO	Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
L374130	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
L374124	u6538	m434	MARIO	Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
L374123	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.
L374122	u6538	m434	MARIO	Wha?
L374121	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Francis Macomber.
L374120	u6538	m434	MARIO	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
L374119	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nothing.
L374118	u6538	m434	MARIO	What was it?
L374117	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Wasn't a book...was a short story.
L374242	u6542	m434	TERESA	For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
L374241	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
L374214	u6542	m434	TERESA	But...
L374213	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
L374212	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
L374211	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
L374073	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
L374072	u6542	m434	TERESA	The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
L373947	u6542	m434	TERESA	The green capsules in the top drawer.
L373946	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
L373945	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm sleepy.
L373944	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
L373943	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
L373942	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
L373938	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	I know...I know.
L373937	u6542	m434	TERESA	I can take care of myself.  You know that.
L373936	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well you can't blame them in a way.
L373935	u6542	m434	TERESA	You know why...with my parents.
L373934	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
L373933	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
L373931	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Watch your language.
L373930	u6542	m434	TERESA	You're intolerable today.
L373929	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That W.A.S.P. bastard.
L373928	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
L373927	u6542	m434	TERESA	Sure...He lives there?
L373926	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
L373924	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	That's the word...preoccupied.
L373923	u6542	m434	TERESA	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
L373922	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Take your time.  I don't care.
L373921	u6542	m434	TERESA	It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
L373920	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
L373919	u6542	m434	TERESA	A paper on that one too?
L373918	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Bore.
L373917	u6542	m434	TERESA	Ok.
L373916	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
L373915	u6542	m434	TERESA	C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
L373862	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
L373861	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's still sick.
L373860	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
L373859	u6542	m434	TERESA	It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
L373858	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
L373857	u6542	m434	TERESA	No.
L373856	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Did you?
L373855	u6542	m434	TERESA	Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
L373854	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Don't ask.
L373853	u6542	m434	TERESA	What is it now?
L373852	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
L373851	u6542	m434	TERESA	Anything specific?
L373850	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
L373849	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Nobody knows anything, believe me.
L373848	u6542	m434	TERESA	Charlie...?
L373847	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Maybe, who knows.
L373846	u6542	m434	TERESA	An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
L373845	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
L373844	u6542	m434	TERESA	It's all right.
L373843	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Sure...it's not that...I mean...
L373842	u6542	m434	TERESA	I don't mind.
L373841	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...
L373840	u6542	m434	TERESA	Please take it.
L373839	u6542	m434	TERESA	Here.
L373838	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
L373837	u6542	m434	TERESA	Do you have enough?
L373836	u6532	m434	CHARLIE	Ok, we'll go for lunch.
L373835	u6542	m434	TERESA	I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
L374196	u6536	m434	JOEY	Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
L374195	u6537	m434	JOHNNY BOY	Count it.
L374194	u6536	m434	JOEY	Don't count it...it's all there.

L384896	u6608	m440	PETER	Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
L384894	u6608	m440	PETER	Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.

L384843	u6605	m440	JOSH	Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
L384842	u6608	m440	PETER	Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
L384841	u6605	m440	JOSH	"The blintzes!  ""Try the blintzes..."""
L385149	u6605	m440	JOSH	Right.
L385148	u6606	m440	LEONARD	And a right.
L385147	u6605	m440	JOSH	I think so. One right, two lefts...
L385146	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
L385145	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
L385144	u6605	m440	JOSH	H-how do I get...?
L385143	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
L385111	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
L385110	u6605	m440	JOSH	What?
L385109	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
L385099	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
L385098	u6605	m440	JOSH	There's really people living down here?
L385097	u6605	m440	JOSH	New York's finest.
L385096	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
L385315	u6608	m440	PETER	Go!! Just go!!
L385314	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What do you-?
L385313	u6608	m440	PETER	The kid's with them!!
L385312	u6606	m440	LEONARD	The kid...
L385273	u6608	m440	PETER	Depends.  You got a memo?
L385272	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
L385256	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
L385255	u6608	m440	PETER	Can we get this car there?
L385231	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
L385230	u6608	m440	PETER	Is there a switch?
L385213	u6606	m440	LEONARD	How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
L385212	u6608	m440	PETER	It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
L385211	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Mistake?  What's that supposed to...?
L385210	u6608	m440	PETER	A mistake.
L385208	u6608	m440	PETER	I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
L385207	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
L385206	u6608	m440	PETER	Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
L385205	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
L385204	u6608	m440	PETER	You feel anything?
L385197	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, Jesus!!
L385196	u6608	m440	PETER	Its muscles are locked.
L385194	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
L385193	u6608	m440	PETER	Wait a minute-
L385177	u6608	m440	PETER	Just do it!
L385176	u6606	m440	LEONARD	I only got...
L385160	u6606	m440	LEONARD	All right, motherfucker, that's it.
L385159	u6608	m440	PETER	For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
L385158	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
L385157	u6608	m440	PETER	What?
L385156	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, man, there you go again.
L385155	u6608	m440	PETER	You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
L385154	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
L385153	u6608	m440	PETER	Any luck?
L385142	u6608	m440	PETER	You got a better way up?
L385141	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Oh, that's gonna work.
L385136	u6608	m440	PETER	Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
L385135	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Did you see the size of that thing?!
L385108	u6608	m440	PETER	20 minutes.  Susan?
L385107	u6606	m440	LEONARD	20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
L385106	u6608	m440	PETER	We'll be back at the platform in...
L385005	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
L385004	u6608	m440	PETER	For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
L385001	u6606	m440	LEONARD	No, you talkin' at me.
L385000	u6608	m440	PETER	Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
L384993	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
L384992	u6608	m440	PETER	Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
L384991	u6606	m440	LEONARD	...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
L384990	u6608	m440	PETER	The Department of Public Health...
L384989	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
L384988	u6608	m440	PETER	Look, I showed you my badge...
L385297	u6607	m440	MANNY	Nino, please...
L385296	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
L385271	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
L385270	u6607	m440	MANNY	I pull.
L385269	u6606	m440	LEONARD	The lights come up, you pull the switch.
L385191	u6607	m440	MANNY	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
L385190	u6606	m440	LEONARD	You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
L385170	u6607	m440	MANNY	Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
L385169	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What are you doing down here?
L385164	u6607	m440	MANNY	Hurry, the woman needs help!
L385163	u6606	m440	LEONARD	My God, what the hell are you...?
L384999	u6606	m440	LEONARD	He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
L384998	u6607	m440	MANNY	He's special.
L385327	u6606	m440	LEONARD	No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
L385326	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We're no leaving you!
L385323	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Across both tracks!!
L385322	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Which way?
L385318	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
L385317	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What?
L385316	u6606	m440	LEONARD	He didn't do it!
L385262	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
L385261	u6606	m440	LEONARD	It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
L385258	u6606	m440	LEONARD	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
L385257	u6611	m440	SUSAN	But the power...
L385252	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
L385251	u6606	m440	LEONARD	What are you putting that crap on me for?
L385278	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
L385277	u6607	m440	MANNY	I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
L385276	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Manny...
L385275	u6607	m440	MANNY	He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
L385226	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
L385225	u6607	m440	MANNY	...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ...
L385224	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
L385217	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No...
L385216	u6607	m440	MANNY	But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
L385215	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Just inner chambers...
L385352	u6608	m440	PETER	We can do it!
L385351	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No...
L385345	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter...
L385344	u6608	m440	PETER	Talk to me.
L385343	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Ah...
L385342	u6608	m440	PETER	C'mon...
L385339	u6608	m440	PETER	I can.  We can do this...
L385338	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Your arm, you can't...
L385337	u6608	m440	PETER	You go first. I'll be right below you.
L385336	u6608	m440	PETER	Jump in.
L385335	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Oh, come on, come on!
L385286	u6611	m440	SUSAN	That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
L385285	u6608	m440	PETER	I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
L385281	u6608	m440	PETER	Try not to sweat?
L385280	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
L385267	u6608	m440	PETER	That's why we should do it now.
L385266	u6611	m440	SUSAN	The scent won't last...
L385265	u6608	m440	PETER	It worked before...
L385264	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Peter-
L385263	u6608	m440	PETER	We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
L385250	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Just do it!!
L385249	u6608	m440	PETER	What-
L385248	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Rub it on the windows!
L385243	u6608	m440	PETER	Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
L385242	u6611	m440	SUSAN	They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
L385241	u6608	m440	PETER	It's no use! They know we're in here!
L385240	u6608	m440	PETER	How?!
L385239	u6611	m440	SUSAN	His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
L385220	u6611	m440	SUSAN	That's camouflage...
L385219	u6608	m440	PETER	So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
L385175	u6608	m440	PETER	Toss the flare down!
L385174	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No, Jesus, no.
L385167	u6608	m440	PETER	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
L385166	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't.
L385103	u6608	m440	PETER	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
L385102	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It's me. Can you hear me?
L385059	u6608	m440	PETER	I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
L385058	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It didn't bite me.
L385057	u6608	m440	PETER	Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
L385056	u6608	m440	PETER	No.
L385055	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
L385054	u6608	m440	PETER	You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
L385053	u6611	m440	SUSAN	...you don't even know what you're looking for.
L385040	u6608	m440	PETER	Susan, we're not b-
L385039	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
L385038	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I was just late.
L385037	u6608	m440	PETER	Oh, no, you were-
L385034	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Right.
L385033	u6608	m440	PETER	Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
L385032	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
L385031	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No such thing, baby.
L385030	u6608	m440	PETER	Great crowd.
L385010	u6608	m440	PETER	Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
L385009	u6611	m440	SUSAN	He was just doing his job.
L385008	u6608	m440	PETER	Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
L385007	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I heard how you talked to him.
L385006	u6608	m440	PETER	You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
L384985	u6611	m440	SUSAN	No, there's...
L384984	u6608	m440	PETER	Honey, just leave it.
L384965	u6608	m440	PETER	So?
L384964	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Metaxonycha Godmani.
L384960	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
L384959	u6608	m440	PETER	Maybe they lied to you.
L384958	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
L384953	u6608	m440	PETER	We?
L384952	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
L384950	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Don't you get it? It's more than that.
L384949	u6608	m440	PETER	Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
L384948	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
L384947	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
L384946	u6608	m440	PETER	Thought it was my week for that.
L384837	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I'll be late.
L384836	u6608	m440	PETER	Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
L384835	u6608	m440	PETER	Don't get kinky here...
L384834	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
L384831	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
L384830	u6608	m440	PETER	You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
L384816	u6611	m440	SUSAN	"We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh?"
L384815	u6608	m440	PETER	Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
L384809	u6608	m440	PETER	Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
L384808	u6611	m440	SUSAN	We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
L384807	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You know what I mean...
L384806	u6608	m440	PETER	Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
L384805	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Do you think we did the right thing?
L384804	u6608	m440	PETER	You did!
L384803	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Please.
L384802	u6608	m440	PETER	A shame.  You looked great tonight.
L384973	u6609	m440	RICKY	No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
L384972	u6611	m440	SUSAN	"An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside."
L384971	u6609	m440	RICKY	Gross. What is it?
L384970	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You sure you didn't see one of these?
L384879	u6609	m440	RICKY	That's it?
L384878	u6611	m440	SUSAN	You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
L384870	u6609	m440	RICKY	You the bug lady, right?
L384869	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Hello.
L384920	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I know.  Help me get a sample.
L384919	u6610	m440	SIRI	That's impossible.  Insects don't...
L384917	u6610	m440	SIRI	What?
L384916	u6611	m440	SUSAN	My God.
L384915	u6611	m440	SUSAN	And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
L384914	u6610	m440	SIRI	Fuck! It broke the skin...
L384913	u6611	m440	SUSAN	This wing configuration. I've never...
L384912	u6610	m440	SIRI	No shit.
L384911	u6611	m440	SUSAN	It bit you.
L384908	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I have no idea.  Are you ready?
L384907	u6610	m440	SIRI	What is it?
L384906	u6611	m440	SUSAN	I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
L384868	u6610	m440	SIRI	Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
L384867	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What's this?
L384864	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Oh, Jesus.
L384863	u6610	m440	SIRI	Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
L384862	u6610	m440	SIRI	She used a baster.
L384861	u6611	m440	SUSAN	What?
L384860	u6610	m440	SIRI	I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
L384859	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
L384858	u6610	m440	SIRI	I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
L384857	u6611	m440	SUSAN	...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
L384839	u6610	m440	SIRI	Just like Trump Tower, then.
L384838	u6611	m440	SUSAN	Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
L398836	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Sure.
L398835	u6712	m447	NICK	Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
L398834	u6705	m447	ALBERT	"Well, technically ""yes"", but this is only the prototype."
L398833	u6712	m447	NICK	Could you play ARCADE with that?
L398826	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
L398825	u6712	m447	NICK	How the hell did you do that?
L398817	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
L398816	u6712	m447	NICK	Just tell me the fucking riddle.
L398815	u6705	m447	ALBERT	If I tell you, then it's no fun.
L398814	u6712	m447	NICK	What's the riddle?
L398813	u6705	m447	ALBERT	You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
L398812	u6712	m447	NICK	How do you stop The Screamer?
L398811	u6705	m447	ALBERT	You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
L398808	u6705	m447	ALBERT	It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
L398807	u6712	m447	NICK	What do you mean?
L398804	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
L398803	u6712	m447	NICK	Does that thing work?
L398832	u6705	m447	ALBERT	And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
L398831	u6706	m447	ALEX	The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
L398830	u6705	m447	ALBERT	He?
L398829	u6706	m447	ALEX	Maybe he's not dead.
L398828	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
L398827	u6706	m447	ALEX	Dead?
L398824	u6705	m447	ALBERT	It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
L398823	u6706	m447	ALEX	But how can it change every time?
L398822	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
L398821	u6706	m447	ALEX	How do you do that?
L398820	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
L398819	u6706	m447	ALEX	What's the question mark?
L398818	u6705	m447	ALBERT	The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
L398810	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
L398809	u6706	m447	ALEX	We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
L398806	u6705	m447	ALBERT	Yeah, who isn't.
L398805	u6706	m447	ALEX	We're having some problems with ARCADE...
L398789	u6706	m447	ALEX	There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
L398788	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Talk to me.
L398787	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Why don't we take this into my office.
L398786	u6706	m447	ALEX	Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
L398785	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
L398783	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	You don't like it?
L398782	u6706	m447	ALEX	It's the game, ARCADE.
L398781	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Now what seems to be the problem?
L398780	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
L398779	u6706	m447	ALEX	How'd you know it was us?
L398778	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Nick, Alex, how are we today?
L398974	u6706	m447	ALEX	But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
L398973	u6713	m447	STILTS	I came from the city on the left.
L398972	u6706	m447	ALEX	Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
L398683	u6713	m447	STILTS	Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
L398682	u6706	m447	ALEX	Did you play ARCADE last night?
L398681	u6713	m447	STILTS	What's her problem?
L398680	u6706	m447	ALEX	Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
L398679	u6713	m447	STILTS	Sick?
L398599	u6713	m447	STILTS	He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
L398598	u6706	m447	ALEX	Has anyone seen Greg?
L398507	u6713	m447	STILTS	What the hell does that mean?
L398506	u6706	m447	ALEX	"He thinks I'm ""sublimating""."
L399033	u6706	m447	ALEX	I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
L399032	u6712	m447	NICK	What is it?
L398942	u6706	m447	ALEX	Never been on a snowboard.
L398941	u6712	m447	NICK	We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
L398940	u6706	m447	ALEX	There never is.
L398939	u6712	m447	NICK	Christ...no time...
L398938	u6712	m447	NICK	I don't want to talk about it.
L398937	u6706	m447	ALEX	One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
L398936	u6712	m447	NICK	So that's what we almost died for?
L398935	u6706	m447	ALEX	We don't have a choice!
L398934	u6712	m447	NICK	We can't reach that!
L398932	u6706	m447	ALEX	Screamer.
L398931	u6712	m447	NICK	What the fuck is that?!
L398929	u6706	m447	ALEX	Look around...
L398928	u6712	m447	NICK	What?!  There's nothing here!
L398927	u6706	m447	ALEX	Our time's up.
L398923	u6706	m447	ALEX	Check your read-out.
L398922	u6712	m447	NICK	Shit...
L398921	u6706	m447	ALEX	There...
L398920	u6712	m447	NICK	Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
L398919	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yeah, that's what worries me.
L398918	u6712	m447	NICK	And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
L398914	u6712	m447	NICK	Right, then...
L398913	u6706	m447	ALEX	The clock's already ticking.
L398911	u6706	m447	ALEX	The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
L398910	u6712	m447	NICK	Okay.  It's West.
L398908	u6706	m447	ALEX	You've got the schematics, check.
L398907	u6712	m447	NICK	Which way do you think Level Two is?
L398905	u6706	m447	ALEX	Got it.
L398904	u6712	m447	NICK	I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
L398903	u6712	m447	NICK	That's what I was hoping you'd say.
L398902	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
L398901	u6712	m447	NICK	Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
L398900	u6712	m447	NICK	Don't even say it.
L398899	u6706	m447	ALEX	One.  In case...
L398898	u6712	m447	NICK	Okay.  Give us a kiss?
L398897	u6712	m447	NICK	We're actually inside, aren't we?
L398896	u6706	m447	ALEX	You feel it?  It's different this time.
L398885	u6712	m447	NICK	I know.  It sucks.
L398884	u6706	m447	ALEX	I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
L398883	u6712	m447	NICK	I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
L398882	u6706	m447	ALEX	What?
L398881	u6712	m447	NICK	You don't get it, do you?
L398879	u6712	m447	NICK	No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
L398878	u6706	m447	ALEX	And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
L398877	u6712	m447	NICK	I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
L398876	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yes I am...
L398875	u6712	m447	NICK	You're not coming, Alex.
L398871	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
L398870	u6712	m447	NICK	It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
L398869	u6706	m447	ALEX	Put in a quarter.
L398868	u6712	m447	NICK	I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
L398865	u6712	m447	NICK	A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
L398864	u6706	m447	ALEX	What are you looking for?
L398858	u6706	m447	ALEX	You didn't hear me?
L398857	u6712	m447	NICK	Alex...
L398852	u6712	m447	NICK	Yeah.  The Inferno.
L398851	u6706	m447	ALEX	Dante's Inferno.
L398850	u6712	m447	NICK	I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
L398848	u6712	m447	NICK	Everything.
L398847	u6706	m447	ALEX	You got the schematics?
L398846	u6706	m447	ALEX	I can't believe you made it!
L398845	u6712	m447	NICK	Jesus Christ!
L398839	u6712	m447	NICK	Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
L398838	u6706	m447	ALEX	What are you going to do?
L398837	u6712	m447	NICK	Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
L398792	u6712	m447	NICK	We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
L398791	u6706	m447	ALEX	No I'm not...
L398790	u6712	m447	NICK	"What Alex is trying to say is that it ""seems"" like it's alive."
L398777	u6712	m447	NICK	Drives 'em crazy every time.
L398776	u6706	m447	ALEX	Virgin sacrifices?
L398766	u6706	m447	ALEX	I was afraid you'd say that.
L398765	u6712	m447	NICK	You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
L398764	u6706	m447	ALEX	And beat it at it's own game.
L398763	u6712	m447	NICK	You mean we learn the rules...
L398762	u6706	m447	ALEX	They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
L398761	u6712	m447	NICK	What?
L398760	u6706	m447	ALEX	SLIP-STREAM.
L398759	u6712	m447	NICK	I don't know.
L398758	u6706	m447	ALEX	Then where do we go?!
L398757	u6712	m447	NICK	Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
L398756	u6706	m447	ALEX	The Police, then...
L398755	u6712	m447	NICK	It's already out.
L398754	u6706	m447	ALEX	Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
L398753	u6712	m447	NICK	Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
L398752	u6706	m447	ALEX	...but then it hits the relay stations...
L398751	u6712	m447	NICK	It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
L398750	u6706	m447	ALEX	Like the fractals?
L398749	u6712	m447	NICK	Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
L398748	u6706	m447	ALEX	Nick, what is it.
L398747	u6712	m447	NICK	It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
L398746	u6706	m447	ALEX	What?
L398745	u6712	m447	NICK	That's what I thought.
L398739	u6712	m447	NICK	My house.  I want to try something.
L398738	u6706	m447	ALEX	Where do we go?
L398736	u6712	m447	NICK	We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
L398735	u6706	m447	ALEX	We can't...
L398734	u6712	m447	NICK	Then leave her.
L398726	u6712	m447	NICK	What?!
L398725	u6706	m447	ALEX	Change the channel!
L398708	u6706	m447	ALEX	Let's go around back.
L398707	u6712	m447	NICK	It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
L398706	u6706	m447	ALEX	This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
L398702	u6706	m447	ALEX	Laurie's.
L398701	u6712	m447	NICK	Where to now?
L398700	u6706	m447	ALEX	She thought Benz was at school.
L398699	u6712	m447	NICK	Well?
L398690	u6712	m447	NICK	Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
L398689	u6706	m447	ALEX	If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
L398688	u6712	m447	NICK	No way.
L398687	u6706	m447	ALEX	We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
L398676	u6706	m447	ALEX	Sure.
L398675	u6712	m447	NICK	It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
L398674	u6712	m447	NICK	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
L398673	u6706	m447	ALEX	Because I didn't know where else to go.
L398671	u6706	m447	ALEX	All of them?
L398670	u6712	m447	NICK	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
L398669	u6706	m447	ALEX	Something's happened to them.
L398665	u6706	m447	ALEX	Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
L398664	u6712	m447	NICK	Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
L398661	u6712	m447	NICK	No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
L398660	u6706	m447	ALEX	It turned itself back on, Nick.
L398658	u6712	m447	NICK	Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
L398657	u6706	m447	ALEX	"See, men always do this.  ""Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium"". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!"
L398656	u6712	m447	NICK	You imagined it.
L398655	u6706	m447	ALEX	So how did it know my name, then?
L398654	u6712	m447	NICK	How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
L398653	u6706	m447	ALEX	It is.
L398652	u6712	m447	NICK	Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
L398651	u6706	m447	ALEX	"No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, ""In here""."
L398650	u6706	m447	ALEX	No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
L398649	u6712	m447	NICK	Happy?
L398648	u6706	m447	ALEX	Turn if off!
L398647	u6712	m447	NICK	I'm in the middle of it...
L398646	u6706	m447	ALEX	Can you turn off the game?
L398645	u6706	m447	ALEX	Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
L398644	u6712	m447	NICK	"What do you mean by ""weird""?"
L398639	u6706	m447	ALEX	Funny.
L398638	u6712	m447	NICK	Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
L398633	u6706	m447	ALEX	I'm coming over.
L398632	u6712	m447	NICK	It's twelve-thirty!
L398631	u6706	m447	ALEX	No, in person.  Now.
L398630	u6712	m447	NICK	We are talking...
L398629	u6706	m447	ALEX	I have to talk to you.
L398627	u6712	m447	NICK	What the hell are you talking about?
L398626	u6706	m447	ALEX	Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
L398625	u6712	m447	NICK	Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
L398624	u6706	m447	ALEX	Nick...
L398623	u6712	m447	NICK	Hey, kid.
L398622	u6706	m447	ALEX	Hello?
L398606	u6706	m447	ALEX	But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
L398605	u6712	m447	NICK	So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
L398604	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yeah...
L398603	u6712	m447	NICK	Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
L398602	u6712	m447	NICK	Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
L398601	u6706	m447	ALEX	So where is he?
L399031	u6706	m447	ALEX	Well, it's a long story...
L399030	u6710	m447	GREG	So how did you do it, Alex?
L398586	u6710	m447	GREG	Hold my keys, then.
L398585	u6706	m447	ALEX	Go for it.
L398539	u6710	m447	GREG	Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
L398538	u6706	m447	ALEX	And then keep on driving?
L398537	u6710	m447	GREG	Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
L398517	u6710	m447	GREG	Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
L398516	u6706	m447	ALEX	I'm okay.
L398515	u6710	m447	GREG	So tell me you're okay, then.
L398514	u6706	m447	ALEX	I know.
L398513	u6710	m447	GREG	Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
L398995	u6706	m447	ALEX	Oh God...oh god...
L398994	u6708	m447	BOY	It's here!!!
L398993	u6706	m447	ALEX	In this world, wrong is right!
L398992	u6708	m447	BOY	It's the wrong way!
L398990	u6708	m447	BOY	That way.
L398989	u6706	m447	ALEX	Which way?
L398986	u6706	m447	ALEX	Then we'll go home.
L398985	u6708	m447	BOY	Then we'll go home?
L398982	u6706	m447	ALEX	Thought so.
L398981	u6708	m447	BOY	Yes...
L398980	u6706	m447	ALEX	How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
L398970	u6711	m447	LAURIE	You have no time.
L398969	u6706	m447	ALEX	I'm thinking!
L398968	u6711	m447	LAURIE	You have no time.  What is your question?
L398967	u6706	m447	ALEX	Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
L398966	u6706	m447	ALEX	Wait!  No!  That's not it!
L398965	u6711	m447	LAURIE	Is that your question?
L398964	u6706	m447	ALEX	What did he do to you?
L399023	u6707	m447	ALEX'S MOTHER	Not yet, honey...
L399022	u6706	m447	ALEX	Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
L399020	u6706	m447	ALEX	Yes...but...how did you...
L399019	u6707	m447	ALEX'S MOTHER	I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
L399018	u6707	m447	ALEX'S MOTHER	I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
L399017	u6706	m447	ALEX	But I don't understand...
L399016	u6707	m447	ALEX'S MOTHER	Of course I am.
L399015	u6706	m447	ALEX	Mom?  You're alive...
L398796	u6712	m447	NICK	The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
L398795	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
L398592	u6712	m447	NICK	Sign me up.
L398591	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	So what do you think?
L398573	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	The game will guide you.
L398572	u6712	m447	NICK	So how do I start?
L398571	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
L398570	u6712	m447	NICK	So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
L398566	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
L398565	u6712	m447	NICK	Escape?
L398561	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
L398560	u6712	m447	NICK	That's impossible.
L398559	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
L398558	u6712	m447	NICK	So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
L398557	u6709	m447	DIFFORD	We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
L399038	u6713	m447	STILTS	I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
L399037	u6711	m447	LAURIE	Give her a chance, will you?
L399036	u6713	m447	STILTS	So start at the beginning...
L398963	u6711	m447	LAURIE	I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
L398962	u6713	m447	STILTS	I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
L398961	u6711	m447	LAURIE	One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
L398533	u6713	m447	STILTS	Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
L398532	u6711	m447	LAURIE	"Can you say anything but ""cool""?"
L398531	u6713	m447	STILTS	Cool.
L398509	u6713	m447	STILTS	Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
L398508	u6711	m447	LAURIE	It means she's screwed up.
L410762	u6841	m457	3JANE	Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
L410761	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
L410760	u6841	m457	3JANE	You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
L410758	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't play with me.
L410757	u6841	m457	3JANE	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
L410756	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Take this off.
L410754	u6841	m457	3JANE	Then we would have talked, you and I.
L410753	u6851	m457	MOLLY	No. I only needed the code from you.
L410752	u6841	m457	3JANE	Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
L410621	u6841	m457	3JANE	Of course.
L410620	u6851	m457	MOLLY	They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
L410619	u6841	m457	3JANE	I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
L410618	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Let me get you another glass of wine.
L410616	u6841	m457	3JANE	I'm fine.
L410615	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
L410796	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Of course...
L410795	u6841	m457	3JANE	What about her?
L410794	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
L410793	u6841	m457	3JANE	You're hurt...
L410742	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
L410741	u6841	m457	3JANE	Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
L410733	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
L410732	u6841	m457	3JANE	She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
L410782	u6845	m457	CASE	No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
L410781	u6842	m457	AEROL	Ghost a steppin' razor...
L410747	u6845	m457	CASE	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410746	u6842	m457	AEROL	What you lookin' for, mon?
L410728	u6842	m457	AEROL	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
L410727	u6845	m457	CASE	What the hell is that?
L410717	u6842	m457	AEROL	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
L410716	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
L410672	u6845	m457	CASE	If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
L410671	u6842	m457	AEROL	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
L410670	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you get us into Straylight?
L410565	u6842	m457	AEROL	The Elders, mon...
L410564	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you doing in here?
L410543	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
L410542	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How's the villa's security?
L410541	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
L410534	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
L410533	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
L410476	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
L410475	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
L410234	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
L410233	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's an A.I.
L410229	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
L410228	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Easy...
L410547	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	And how do you suggest I do that?
L410546	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
L410518	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What?
L410517	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
L410516	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
L410510	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
L410509	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
L410508	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
L410502	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Why not?
L410501	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Alright. Let's talk business.
L410607	u6845	m457	CASE	I find out now.
L410606	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
L410600	u6845	m457	CASE	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
L410599	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You've got your orders.
L410597	u6845	m457	CASE	The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
L410596	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What are you talking about?
L410595	u6845	m457	CASE	As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
L410594	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
L410593	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
L410538	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
L410537	u6845	m457	CASE	That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
L410474	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
L410473	u6845	m457	CASE	The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
L410472	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
L410471	u6845	m457	CASE	He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
L410470	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
L410469	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You see the couple up in the balcony?
L410468	u6845	m457	CASE	Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
L410356	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
L410355	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah, well it's working.
L410349	u6845	m457	CASE	Linked?
L410348	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
L410347	u6845	m457	CASE	That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
L410346	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	"Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems."
L410345	u6845	m457	CASE	Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
L410344	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Prepping your trip.
L410343	u6845	m457	CASE	He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
L410342	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What about McCoy?
L410341	u6845	m457	CASE	Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
L410340	u6845	m457	CASE	No, but it traced me.
L410339	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Did you trace it?
L410338	u6845	m457	CASE	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
L410337	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What's this?
L410333	u6845	m457	CASE	What's he doing to my gear?
L410332	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
L410331	u6845	m457	CASE	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
L410330	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You ran without us.
L410251	u6845	m457	CASE	It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
L410250	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
L410249	u6845	m457	CASE	And then?
L410248	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
L410247	u6845	m457	CASE	Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
L410246	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
L410245	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you talking about?
L410244	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
L410243	u6845	m457	CASE	That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
L410242	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I've arranged for him to work with us.
L410241	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
L410240	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Dixie McCoy
L410239	u6845	m457	CASE	I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
L410238	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	It hasn't yet.
L410237	u6845	m457	CASE	Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
L410236	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
L410235	u6845	m457	CASE	First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
L410232	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
L410231	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
L410230	u6845	m457	CASE	Why'd you do it, Armitage?
L410227	u6845	m457	CASE	You son of a bitch...
L410226	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
L410225	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good, because you've got a new one.
L410224	u6845	m457	CASE	Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
L410223	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
L410222	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
L410221	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
L410177	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
L410176	u6845	m457	CASE	Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
L410175	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
L410174	u6845	m457	CASE	It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
L410173	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
L410172	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
L410171	u6845	m457	CASE	I'd say you were full of shit.
L410170	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
L410169	u6845	m457	CASE	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
L410168	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
L410167	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
L410166	u6845	m457	CASE	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
L410165	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
L410164	u6845	m457	CASE	What does this have to do with me?
L410163	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
L410160	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Very well.
L410159	u6845	m457	CASE	You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
L410158	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
L410712	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
L410711	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
L410710	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
L410709	u6845	m457	CASE	What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
L410708	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
L410707	u6845	m457	CASE	The access code to your mainframe.
L410706	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	The words?
L410705	u6845	m457	CASE	Tell me the words.
L410703	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
L410702	u6845	m457	CASE	Are you even really alive?
L410701	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	"You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute""."
L410698	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
L410697	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you read my mind?
L410696	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
L410695	u6845	m457	CASE	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
L410694	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	An odd selection, Mr Case.
L410105	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah.
L410104	u6852	m457	RATZ	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
L410103	u6845	m457	CASE	You're pleasant tonight.
L410102	u6852	m457	RATZ	Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
L410101	u6852	m457	RATZ	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
L410100	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't have a girl.
L410099	u6852	m457	RATZ	I saw your girl yesterday.
L410095	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
L410094	u6852	m457	RATZ	Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
L410306	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
L410305	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
L410304	u6845	m457	CASE	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
L410303	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
L410302	u6845	m457	CASE	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
L410301	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
L410300	u6845	m457	CASE	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
L410299	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
L410298	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah. That was me.
L410297	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
L410296	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Dixie. Fine.
L410295	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
L410294	u6845	m457	CASE	It's Case. Remember me?
L410293	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Hey, bro.
L410906	u6845	m457	CASE	Maybe so...
L410905	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Jah guides us.
L410904	u6845	m457	CASE	Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
L410902	u6845	m457	CASE	We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
L410901	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
L410900	u6845	m457	CASE	Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
L410895	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
L410894	u6845	m457	CASE	Ready?
L410890	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you walk?
L410889	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Four men. Babylon soldiers.
L410787	u6845	m457	CASE	The girl 3Jane. We need her.
L410786	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
L410766	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
L410765	u6845	m457	CASE	We're doing fine. Take the next right.
L410674	u6845	m457	CASE	I an' I, man. I an' I.
L410673	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
L410613	u6845	m457	CASE	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
L410612	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	All things possible in Babylon.
L410611	u6845	m457	CASE	Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
L410610	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
L410609	u6845	m457	CASE	She's ready to go.
L410572	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
L410571	u6845	m457	CASE	What elders?
L410858	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
L410857	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the route to the core?
L410848	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
L410847	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
L410846	u6846	m457	DIXIE	This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
L410845	u6845	m457	CASE	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
L410844	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You haven't got it?
L410843	u6845	m457	CASE	It's coming.
L410842	u6846	m457	DIXIE	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
L410841	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice?
L410840	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You're late.
L410779	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
L410778	u6845	m457	CASE	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
L410777	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
L410776	u6845	m457	CASE	Less than thirty minutes.
L410775	u6846	m457	DIXIE	How much time you got left?
L410774	u6845	m457	CASE	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
L410773	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
L410772	u6845	m457	CASE	How long, Dixie?
L410771	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
L410770	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
L410769	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice break?
L410768	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410685	u6845	m457	CASE	Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
L410684	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It'll flatline your ass.
L410682	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
L410681	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What are you talkin' about?
L410680	u6845	m457	CASE	You can make your move when it comes after me.
L410679	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
L410678	u6845	m457	CASE	We run. You crack the pattern?
L410677	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
L410676	u6845	m457	CASE	We got problems topside.
L410675	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Where the hell have you been?
L410562	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
L410561	u6845	m457	CASE	The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
L410560	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
L410559	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
L410558	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
L410557	u6845	m457	CASE	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
L410556	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
L410555	u6845	m457	CASE	Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
L410554	u6846	m457	DIXIE	He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
L410553	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
L410552	u6845	m457	CASE	Bright enough to be dangerous.
L410551	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
L410550	u6845	m457	CASE	It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
L410431	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
L410430	u6845	m457	CASE	I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
L410429	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
L410428	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
L410427	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you take me to it?
L410426	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
L410425	u6845	m457	CASE	How are we doing?
L410424	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410383	u6846	m457	DIXIE	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
L410382	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410381	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
L410380	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
L410379	u6846	m457	DIXIE	No problem, amigo.
L410378	u6845	m457	CASE	I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
L410377	u6845	m457	CASE	Nobody has.
L410376	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Never heard of him.
L410375	u6845	m457	CASE	A guy who calls himself Armitage.
L410374	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Who got you into this?
L410373	u6845	m457	CASE	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
L410372	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
L410316	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410315	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
L410314	u6845	m457	CASE	You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
L410313	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
L410312	u6845	m457	CASE	Right...
L410311	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
L410810	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	No!... No...
L410809	u6845	m457	CASE	Want to fucking answer them?
L410807	u6845	m457	CASE	The angels... I think they're calling your name.
L410806	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410805	u6845	m457	CASE	Wait... You hear that?
L410545	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
L410544	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the mainframe's access code?
L410498	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
L410497	u6845	m457	CASE	Case.
L410496	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
L410877	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't know. I don't know...
L410876	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Case... are you okay?
L410114	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
L410113	u6845	m457	CASE	Where did you here that?
L410112	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
L410111	u6845	m457	CASE	I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
L410110	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
L410109	u6845	m457	CASE	Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
L410108	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
L410107	u6845	m457	CASE	I thought you already left.
L410106	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Hello, Case.
L410455	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
L410454	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
L410452	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
L410451	u6845	m457	CASE	I think you're full of shit.
L410450	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
L410449	u6845	m457	CASE	Why would you want me to kill you?
L410448	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	"I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My ""ice"" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible."
L410447	u6845	m457	CASE	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
L410446	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
L410445	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
L410444	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
L410443	u6845	m457	CASE	And Linda...
L410442	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I had to limit your options.
L410441	u6845	m457	CASE	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
L410440	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	And we really do have to talk.
L410439	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
L410438	u6845	m457	CASE	I know who you are.
L410831	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Hold on.
L410830	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm still going in.
L410829	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You're out of time, man.
L410828	u6845	m457	CASE	Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
L410827	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it?
L410826	u6845	m457	CASE	Shit...
L410821	u6845	m457	CASE	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
L410820	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My God... these people are insane.
L410818	u6845	m457	CASE	No we don't...
L410817	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We've still got to find the mainframe.
L410816	u6845	m457	CASE	Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410815	u6851	m457	MOLLY	...And if I guess wrong?
L410814	u6845	m457	CASE	The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
L410812	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
L410811	u6845	m457	CASE	Is he going to make it?
L410530	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
L410529	u6851	m457	MOLLY	When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
L410528	u6845	m457	CASE	I know you have. C'mere.
L410527	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
L410525	u6845	m457	CASE	What went down between you and Riviera?
L410524	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I know.
L410483	u6851	m457	MOLLY	For Peter, that's a short trip.
L410482	u6845	m457	CASE	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
L410481	u6851	m457	MOLLY	He projects with neural implants.
L410466	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
L410465	u6845	m457	CASE	Something exotic I hope.

L410459	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll be okay.
L410458	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
L410457	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
L410456	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case... Are you alright?
L410418	u6845	m457	CASE	Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
L410417	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's wrong? Don't like flying?
L410410	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Give me five minutes.

L410395	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case...
L410394	u6845	m457	CASE	...Feels like you.
L410393	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Put the gun down, Case.
L410392	u6845	m457	CASE	It sounds like you.
L410391	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
L410390	u6845	m457	CASE	Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
L410325	u6845	m457	CASE	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
L410324	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You okay?
L410273	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
L410272	u6845	m457	CASE	The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
L410271	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Dixie McCoy didn't.
L410270	u6845	m457	CASE	Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
L410269	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Won't that mean you're dead?
L410268	u6845	m457	CASE	The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
L410266	u6845	m457	CASE	Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
L410265	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Too late?
L410264	u6845	m457	CASE	Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
L410263	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A regular Fagan.
L410262	u6845	m457	CASE	When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
L410261	u6851	m457	MOLLY	So you're a wire junkie.
L410260	u6845	m457	CASE	On a good run... yeah.
L410259	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
L410258	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
L410257	u6851	m457	MOLLY	If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
L410256	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
L410255	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
L410254	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm going in.
L410217	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Go ahead...
L410216	u6845	m457	CASE	What the fuck... are you serious?
L410215	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
L410214	u6845	m457	CASE	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
L410213	u6851	m457	MOLLY	That's not going to help.
L410212	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Couple of days. They'll examine you.
L410211	u6845	m457	CASE	How soon is soon enough?
L410210	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
L410209	u6845	m457	CASE	I gotta know... did it work>
L410208	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Almost two days.
L410207	u6845	m457	CASE	How long have I been out?
L410206	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
L410205	u6845	m457	CASE	Holy shit...
L410199	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410198	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You've been calling her name.
L410189	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's that supposed to mean?
L410188	u6845	m457	CASE	Maybe something's onto him.
L410187	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
L410186	u6845	m457	CASE	Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
L410185	u6851	m457	MOLLY	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
L410184	u6845	m457	CASE	What about before that?
L410183	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Couple of months.
L410182	u6845	m457	CASE	He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
L410181	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
L410180	u6845	m457	CASE	Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
L410150	u6845	m457	CASE	Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
L410149	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
L410148	u6845	m457	CASE	... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
L410147	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it?
L410145	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
L410144	u6845	m457	CASE	What's my end?
L410143	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
L410142	u6845	m457	CASE	Why should I want to meet him.
L410141	u6851	m457	MOLLY	His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
L410851	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Shut up.
L410850	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What the fuck kind of questions are those?
L410835	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What are you talking about?
L410834	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How are you at riddles, Peter?
L410833	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410832	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Get up.
L410739	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
L410738	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Like what?
L410737	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
L410736	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Who?
L410735	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
L410734	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Peter... What do you think you're doing?
L443094	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
L443093	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
L443092	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Probably okay to talk to me now.
L443078	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
L443077	u7054	m472	AUDREY	You came for us....
L443027	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
L443026	u7054	m472	AUDREY	What? What is it?
L442998	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
L442997	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Gonna lose everybody out here....
L442791	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Lookit. Lookit!
L442790	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Don't wanna miss this.
L442848	u7059	m472	PARIS	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
L442847	u7054	m472	AUDREY	You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
L442601	u7054	m472	AUDREY	It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
L442600	u7059	m472	PARIS	Oh, Lord....
L442595	u7059	m472	PARIS	Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
L442594	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
L442593	u7059	m472	PARIS	Tell me that was you.
L442592	u7054	m472	AUDREY	<u>What</u>?
L442591	u7059	m472	PARIS	Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
L443003	u7055	m472	FRY	Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
L443002	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
L442987	u7055	m472	FRY	Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
L442986	u7054	m472	AUDREY	What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
L442985	u7055	m472	FRY	Bring the light!
L442929	u7055	m472	FRY	No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
L442928	u7054	m472	AUDREY	I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
L442912	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
L442911	u7055	m472	FRY	Bottle-count.
L442486	u7054	m472	AUDREY	Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
L442485	u7055	m472	FRY	Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
L443076	u7055	m472	FRY	But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
L443075	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	You barely know them.
L443074	u7055	m472	FRY	I would try for them.
L443073	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	You'd die for them?
L443071	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
L443070	u7055	m472	FRY	But they...they could still be....
L443069	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Just give me your hand.
L443068	u7055	m472	FRY	Don't do this to me....
L443067	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Here. Make it easy on you.
L443066	u7055	m472	FRY	I can't....I can't....
L443065	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Step aboard, Carolyn.
L443064	u7055	m472	FRY	No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
L443063	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
L443062	u7055	m472	FRY	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
L443061	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	They're already dead. Get on board.
L443060	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
L443059	u7055	m472	FRY	Just come with me!
L443057	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
L443056	u7055	m472	FRY	<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
L443055	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
L443054	u7055	m472	FRY	What, you're afraid?
L443053	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
L443052	u7055	m472	FRY	I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
L443051	u7055	m472	FRY	You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
L443050	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
L443039	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	We can't make it.
L443038	u7055	m472	FRY	Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
L443037	u7055	m472	FRY	Riddick? How close?
L443036	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
L443020	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	As fast as you can.
L443019	u7055	m472	FRY	You sure you can keep --
L443018	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	As fast as you can.
L443009	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Let's drop back an' boot up.
L443008	u7055	m472	FRY	We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
L443001	u7055	m472	FRY	Audrey?
L443000	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	One or two.
L442999	u7055	m472	FRY	How many you see?
L442993	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
L442992	u7055	m472	FRY	Get out of our way.
L442991	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Back to the ship, huh?
L442925	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
L442924	u7055	m472	FRY	What about her?
L442921	u7055	m472	FRY	Think about what?
L442920	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
L442919	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	<u>Listen</u>.
L442918	u7055	m472	FRY	Riddick? What the hell are you --
L442910	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
L442909	u7055	m472	FRY	What do you see? Riddick?
L442895	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Saw something I didn't like.
L442894	u7055	m472	FRY	Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
L442891	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
L442890	u7055	m472	FRY	We can, can't we? Trust you?
L442889	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
L442888	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
L442887	u7055	m472	FRY	But I just wanted to say --
L442886	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Had it with deals.
L442885	u7055	m472	FRY	Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
L442768	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
L442767	u7055	m472	FRY	Why, what'd you hear?
L442765	u7055	m472	FRY	You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
L442764	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
L442763	u7055	m472	FRY	Entered our minds.
L442762	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
L442761	u7055	m472	FRY	I got the quick-and-ugly version.
L442760	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
L442759	u7055	m472	FRY	They're coming.
L442758	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Power cells.
L442631	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Look deeper.
L442630	u7055	m472	FRY	Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
L442629	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
L442628	u7055	m472	FRY	Heard about it. Just never seen it.
L442627	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	"Slam doctor. Well, we called him ""doctor."""
L442626	u7055	m472	FRY	You did this? To yourself?
L442624	u7055	m472	FRY	Show me your eyes.
L442623	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
L442621	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
L442620	u7055	m472	FRY	What whispers?
L442619	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	'Mean the whispers?
L442618	u7055	m472	FRY	Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
L442901	u7059	m472	PARIS	I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
L442900	u7055	m472	FRY	What, switch what?
L442899	u7059	m472	PARIS	Can we switch?
L442898	u7055	m472	FRY	Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
L442846	u7055	m472	FRY	We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
L442845	u7059	m472	PARIS	I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
L442841	u7055	m472	FRY	Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
L442840	u7059	m472	PARIS	Possibly.
L442839	u7055	m472	FRY	Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
L442838	u7059	m472	PARIS	Not sure. Ten?
L442837	u7055	m472	FRY	How many bottles?
L442836	u7059	m472	PARIS	Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
L442835	u7055	m472	FRY	...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
L442832	u7055	m472	FRY	It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
L442831	u7059	m472	PARIS	Like the light is scalding it.
L442830	u7055	m472	FRY	There....
L442819	u7059	m472	PARIS	I know what's in here!
L442818	u7055	m472	FRY	Christ, you don't know what's out there!
L442795	u7055	m472	FRY	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
L442794	u7059	m472	PARIS	Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
L442786	u7055	m472	FRY	It's starting....
L442785	u7059	m472	PARIS	What do my eyes see?
L442505	u7059	m472	PARIS	"200-year-old single-malt scotch is to ""booze"" as foie gras is to ""duck guts."""
L442504	u7055	m472	FRY	This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
L442951	u7057	m472	JOHNS	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
L442950	u7055	m472	FRY	We cannot go through there....
L442948	u7055	m472	FRY	Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
L442947	u7057	m472	JOHNS	-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
L442946	u7055	m472	FRY	Just shut up, okay?
L442945	u7057	m472	JOHNS	-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
L442944	u7055	m472	FRY	This does not help us, Johns.
L442939	u7057	m472	JOHNS	No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
L442938	u7055	m472	FRY	Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
L442937	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
L442936	u7055	m472	FRY	I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
L442935	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
L442915	u7055	m472	FRY	Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
L442914	u7057	m472	JOHNS	We aren't completely stupid.
L442893	u7055	m472	FRY	Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
L442892	u7057	m472	JOHNS	So you noticed too?
L442882	u7055	m472	FRY	I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
L442881	u7057	m472	JOHNS	You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
L442880	u7055	m472	FRY	We're just burnin' light here.
L442879	u7057	m472	JOHNS	He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
L442862	u7055	m472	FRY	Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
L442861	u7057	m472	JOHNS	79 kilos.
L442860	u7055	m472	FRY	How much?
L442859	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What the hell's it matter?
L442858	u7055	m472	FRY	How much you weigh, Johns?
L442857	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
L442856	u7055	m472	FRY	For your own fear.
L442855	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Smoke screen for what?
L442854	u7055	m472	FRY	Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
L442853	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
L442844	u7055	m472	FRY	We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
L442843	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
L442829	u7057	m472	JOHNS	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
L442828	u7055	m472	FRY	Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
L442783	u7055	m472	FRY	You coulda helped. And you didn't.
L442782	u7057	m472	JOHNS	My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
L442781	u7055	m472	FRY	Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
L442780	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
L442779	u7055	m472	FRY	<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
L442778	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
L442777	u7055	m472	FRY	And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
L442776	u7057	m472	JOHNS	You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
L442775	u7055	m472	FRY	Never said you were a hype, either.
L442774	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I never said I was.
L442773	u7055	m472	FRY	You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
L442754	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
L442753	u7055	m472	FRY	Dancin' on razor blades here...
L442752	u7057	m472	JOHNS	He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
L442751	u7055	m472	FRY	You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
L442750	u7057	m472	JOHNS	-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
L442749	u7055	m472	FRY	You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
L442748	u7057	m472	JOHNS	May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
L442747	u7055	m472	FRY	Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
L442746	u7057	m472	JOHNS	That's what I said.
L442745	u7055	m472	FRY	You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
L442744	u7057	m472	JOHNS	He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
L442743	u7055	m472	FRY	Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
L442742	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
L442741	u7055	m472	FRY	He can pilot?
L442739	u7055	m472	FRY	<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
L442738	u7057	m472	JOHNS	We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
L442737	u7055	m472	FRY	Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
L442736	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Let's wait on the power cells.
L442735	u7055	m472	FRY	...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
L442729	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Wha'?
L442728	u7055	m472	FRY	60 years ago.
L442727	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
L442712	u7055	m472	FRY	So what happened? Where are they, then?
L442711	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
L442690	u7057	m472	JOHNS	25 kilos each, huh?
L442689	u7055	m472	FRY	15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
L442688	u7057	m472	JOHNS	How many?
L442687	u7055	m472	FRY	Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
L442682	u7055	m472	FRY	Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
L442681	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Little ratty-ass.
L442644	u7055	m472	FRY	Thanks for the tip, Johns.
L442643	u7057	m472	JOHNS	You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
L442642	u7055	m472	FRY	What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
L442641	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
L442640	u7055	m472	FRY	Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
L442638	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
L442637	u7055	m472	FRY	Thought you didn't believe his story.
L442636	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Well, don't ask me to.
L442635	u7055	m472	FRY	<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
L442634	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
L442633	u7055	m472	FRY	Let's just be sure.
L442632	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
L442616	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I assume he licked it clean.
L442615	u7055	m472	FRY	So why isn't it all bloody?
L442614	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
L442613	u7055	m472	FRY	He used that?
L442611	u7055	m472	FRY	Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
L442610	u7057	m472	JOHNS	...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
L442607	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Like my pistola.
L442606	u7055	m472	FRY	Like what?
L442605	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Sorry. Thought I heard something.
L442604	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Shut up.
L442603	u7055	m472	FRY	No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
L442572	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
L442571	u7055	m472	FRY	What?
L442570	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Didn't bite.
L442568	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
L442567	u7055	m472	FRY	So now you know.
L442566	u7055	m472	FRY	During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
L442565	u7057	m472	JOHNS	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
L442564	u7055	m472	FRY	Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
L442563	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
L442562	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
L442561	u7055	m472	FRY	Better keep moving....
L442560	u7057	m472	JOHNS	"So I noticed. Never seen a ""captain"" quite so ready to leave her ship."
L442559	u7055	m472	FRY	No, no, I wanted to get away.
L442557	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Probably right.
L442556	u7055	m472	FRY	Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
L442543	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Tell me it's not a mirage.
L442542	u7055	m472	FRY	What?
L442533	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Which means he went toward sunrise.
L442532	u7055	m472	FRY	Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
L442531	u7057	m472	JOHNS	A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
L442501	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
L442500	u7055	m472	FRY	S'matter?
L442495	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Only around humans.
L442494	u7055	m472	FRY	I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
L442493	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
L442492	u7055	m472	FRY	We just keep him locked up forever?
L442491	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Big Evil?
L442490	u7055	m472	FRY	And him?
L442464	u7055	m472	FRY	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
L442463	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Amazing. I'm Johns.
L442462	u7055	m472	FRY	Hey, me. Over here.
L442461	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Hey, who?
L442460	u7055	m472	FRY	Hey.
L442523	u7055	m472	FRY	Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
L442522	u7062	m472	ZEKE	What, you're goin' off, too?
L442521	u7055	m472	FRY	Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
L442498	u7055	m472	FRY	Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
L442497	u7062	m472	ZEKE	Well? Is it just the pump?
L442483	u7055	m472	FRY	Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
L442482	u7062	m472	ZEKE	So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
L442481	u7055	m472	FRY	It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
L442456	u7058	m472	OWENS	70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
L442455	u7055	m472	FRY	Owens!
L442452	u7055	m472	FRY	And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
L442451	u7058	m472	OWENS	When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
L442450	u7055	m472	FRY	Company's not here, is it?
L442449	u7058	m472	OWENS	Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
L442447	u7055	m472	FRY	So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
L442446	u7058	m472	OWENS	"You mean that ""load"" of passengers?"
L442445	u7055	m472	FRY	Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
L442444	u7058	m472	OWENS	Fry?
L442438	u7058	m472	OWENS	Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
L442437	u7055	m472	FRY	1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
L442435	u7058	m472	OWENS	Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
L442434	u7055	m472	FRY	You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
L442433	u7058	m472	OWENS	I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
L442432	u7055	m472	FRY	He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
L442431	u7058	m472	OWENS	Why did I fall on you?
L443035	u7056	m472	IMAM	Rain.
L443034	u7055	m472	FRY	Oh, no. No, no, no....
L443006	u7055	m472	FRY	And what about the cells?
L443005	u7056	m472	IMAM	The sled as a shield....
L442974	u7055	m472	FRY	Do what I say. Please.
L442973	u7056	m472	IMAM	I would rather we all stay--
L442972	u7055	m472	FRY	Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
L442971	u7056	m472	IMAM	What?
L442970	u7055	m472	FRY	Imam. Slow down.
L442870	u7055	m472	FRY	No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
L442869	u7056	m472	IMAM	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
L442868	u7055	m472	FRY	They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
L442826	u7055	m472	FRY	Riddick?
L442825	u7056	m472	IMAM	Hasan?
L442803	u7056	m472	IMAM	Quiet, please. Everyone.
L442802	u7055	m472	FRY	I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
L442655	u7055	m472	FRY	For now.
L442654	u7056	m472	IMAM	One is all?
L442541	u7056	m472	IMAM	We're all on the same hajj now.
L442540	u7055	m472	FRY	Frightening thought.
L442539	u7056	m472	IMAM	Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
L442538	u7055	m472	FRY	You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
L442537	u7056	m472	IMAM	Some prophet guy. And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
L442536	u7055	m472	FRY	Some prophet guy?
L442535	u7056	m472	IMAM	You know who Muhammad was?
L442534	u7055	m472	FRY	So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
L442510	u7056	m472	IMAM	One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
L442509	u7055	m472	FRY	I don't suppose....
L443098	u7056	m472	IMAM	It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
L443097	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
L443096	u7056	m472	IMAM	New Mecca....
L443033	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
L443032	u7056	m472	IMAM	SULEIMAN!
L443031	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Get the girl back under. Keep going.
L443030	u7056	m472	IMAM	Suleiman!
L443017	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
L443016	u7056	m472	IMAM	He will be with us. Nonetheless.
L443015	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
L443014	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	You <u>don't</u> see.
L443013	u7056	m472	IMAM	I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
L443012	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	And pointless.
L443011	u7056	m472	IMAM	Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
L443010	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What're you doin'?
L442996	u7056	m472	IMAM	You mean....
L442995	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Which half?
L442994	u7056	m472	IMAM	Where's Mr. Johns?
L442933	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	"There is no ""safe."""
L442932	u7056	m472	IMAM	Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
L442714	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Has anyone checked the coring room?
L442713	u7056	m472	IMAM	Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
L442941	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
L442940	u7056	m472	IMAM	She's the captain, we should listen to --
L442917	u7057	m472	JOHNS	He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
L442916	u7056	m472	IMAM	We crossed our own tracks.
L442867	u7056	m472	IMAM	Please...this solves nothing...please....
L442866	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
L442851	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
L442850	u7056	m472	IMAM	I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
L442651	u7056	m472	IMAM	The child heard you before any of us could even....
L442650	u7057	m472	JOHNS	We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
L442584	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I'm born-again.
L442583	u7056	m472	IMAM	God is Great, yes?
L442512	u7056	m472	IMAM	All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
L442511	u7057	m472	JOHNS	For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
L442903	u7059	m472	PARIS	Oh, so I'm disposable?
L442902	u7057	m472	JOHNS	She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
L442817	u7059	m472	PARIS	Not staying in here another....
L442816	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Very big beads.
L442704	u7059	m472	PARIS	Like an emergency life-raft, right?
L442703	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
L442670	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
L442669	u7059	m472	PARIS	So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
L442515	u7059	m472	PARIS	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
L442514	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What the hell are these?
L442507	u7059	m472	PARIS	I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
L442506	u7057	m472	JOHNS	A toast to whatever he just said.
L442503	u7059	m472	PARIS	Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
L442502	u7057	m472	JOHNS	King Tut's tomb....
L442477	u7059	m472	PARIS	Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
L442476	u7057	m472	JOHNS	...then we saw this.
L442984	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
L442983	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
L442982	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
L442980	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
L442979	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
L442978	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
L442977	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
L442976	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What do you care?
L442975	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What's her name, anyway?
L442969	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Don' look, don' look, don' look....
L442968	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	So which one caught your eye?
L442967	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
L442966	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Nice embellishment.
L442965	u7057	m472	JOHNS	<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
L442964	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
L442963	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
L442962	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	"Kept calling it ""murder"" when I did it."
L442961	u7057	m472	JOHNS	"Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called ""triage,"" okay?"
L442958	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What if you're one of five?
L442957	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Not if I'm the one.
L442956	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
L442955	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Just realized that, huh?
L442954	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Ain't all of us gonna make it.
L442931	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
L442930	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Aw, this can't be happening to me....
L442927	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	No. She's not.
L442926	u7057	m472	JOHNS	What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
L442923	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	About the girl.
L442922	u7057	m472	JOHNS	About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
L442897	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
L442896	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Such as.
L442876	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Looks clear.
L442875	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Well, what's it look like now?
L442874	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	"Said ""looks clear."""
L442873	u7057	m472	JOHNS	"<u>Fuck me</u>. You said ""clear."""
L442865	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	How 'bout a cut in your gut?
L442864	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
L442863	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Think about that reward, Johns.
L442810	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Wanna rag your fat mouth?
L442809	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Well, you got the big gauge.
L442808	u7057	m472	JOHNS	I'd rather piss glass.
L442734	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
L442733	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Are you fuckin' kidding me?
L442667	u7057	m472	JOHNS	If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
L442666	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
L442665	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
L442664	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	You'd cut me loose, Boss?
L442663	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
L442662	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
L442661	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
L442660	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Say that again.
L442659	u7057	m472	JOHNS	Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
L442657	u7057	m472	JOHNS	We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
L442656	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
L442547	u7062	m472	ZEKE	Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
L442546	u7059	m472	PARIS	Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
L442529	u7059	m472	PARIS	So much for my cocktail hour.
L442528	u7062	m472	ZEKE	So much for your nightfall.
L442519	u7059	m472	PARIS	Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
L442518	u7062	m472	ZEKE	'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
L442517	u7059	m472	PARIS	Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
L442516	u7062	m472	ZEKE	An' this?
L442726	u7061	m472	SHAZZA	Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
L442725	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What, it's broken?
L442724	u7061	m472	SHAZZA	Take it.
L442723	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
L442722	u7061	m472	SHAZZA	You were tryin' to kill him too.
L442710	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
L442709	u7061	m472	SHAZZA	Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
L442708	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
L442684	u7060	m472	RIDDICK	Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
L442683	u7061	m472	SHAZZA	Not a star-jumper.
L443797	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
L443796	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Seal the cave?
L443713	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No sir, I haven't forgotten.
L443712	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
L443711	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
L443702	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
L443701	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I apologize.
L443700	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
L443699	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
L443678	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
L443677	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
L443676	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
L443674	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
L443673	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did you know we'd come here?
L443520	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
L443519	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
L443377	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
L443376	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
L443375	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
L443374	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
L443373	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Dr. Zaius --
L443319	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
L443318	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
L443774	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good luck then.
L443773	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
L443751	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
L443750	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
L443718	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
L443717	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What are you doing there?
L443716	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
L443685	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
L443684	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, I'd rather you -
L443670	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Shut up.
L443669	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
L443668	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
L443662	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right now, if you like.
L443661	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
L443651	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
L443650	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
L443647	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
L443646	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where does the river lead?
L443625	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
L443624	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
L443623	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
L443622	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
L443621	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You still don't believe me, do you?
L443620	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
L443617	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
L443616	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	As you wish.
L443613	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Just the same, I want one.
L443612	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The best. But we won't need them.
L443611	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Do you have any weapons?
L443610	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
L443631	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
L443630	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
L443607	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
L443606	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did it go?
L443390	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira....
L443389	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
L443372	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
L443371	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
L443370	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
L443369	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, maybe they're not.
L443368	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
L443367	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'I am not a missing link.'
L443365	u7074	m473	ZIRA	How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
L443364	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
L443363	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You didn't think so then.
L443362	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The evidence was very meager --
L443361	u7074	m473	ZIRA	-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
L443360	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's probably wrong --
L443359	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
L443358	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, they won't -
L443357	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
L443356	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
L443355	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
L443354	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I don't. And I'm not going to try.
L443353	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Then how do you account for me?,
L443352	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
L443351	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
L443345	u7074	m473	ZIRA	And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
L443344	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Flight is a scientific impossibility.
L443342	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	And they fell out of the sky with you?
L443341	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
L443340	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
L443339	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Now, just a minute --
L443335	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Where did you learn to do this?
L443334	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
L443333	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
L443308	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
L443307	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The blood transfusion.
L443306	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Remembers what?
L443305	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Look -- she remembers.
L443304	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
L443303	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What's so special about him?
L443302	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
L443301	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Neither do I.
L443300	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No.
L443299	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Do you have to work tonight?
L443218	u7064	m473	DODGE	Blessed are the vegetarians.
L443217	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
L443191	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's find them all.
L443190	u7064	m473	DODGE	Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
L443172	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
L443171	u7064	m473	DODGE	Taylor -- quit riding him.
L443162	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	None at all.
L443161	u7064	m473	DODGE	Any particular reason?
L443160	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That way.
L443159	u7064	m473	DODGE	Which direction?
L443158	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.

L443156	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Any sign of dangerous ionization?
L443155	u7064	m473	DODGE	Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
L443142	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
L443141	u7064	m473	DODGE	But how long is a day?
L443140	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.

L443245	u7065	m473	GALEN	They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
L443244	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
L443243	u7065	m473	GALEN	Hmph.
L443242	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
L443241	u7065	m473	GALEN	You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
L443240	u7074	m473	ZIRA	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
L443239	u7065	m473	GALEN	But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
L443234	u7065	m473	GALEN	These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
L443233	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This place is dirty, doctor.
L443230	u7065	m473	GALEN	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
L443229	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Will he live?
L443228	u7065	m473	GALEN	Him.
L443227	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
L443539	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
L443538	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
L443528	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443527	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection!
L443522	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
L443521	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
L443499	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
L443498	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
L443473	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
L443472	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
L443468	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
L443467	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
L443466	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
L443464	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
L443463	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
L443448	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
L443447	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
L443479	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Show this to the President.
L443478	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
L443477	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
L443476	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
L443475	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
L443474	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
L443331	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Do as I say.
L443330	u7067	m473	JULIUS	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
L443329	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
L443324	u7067	m473	JULIUS	I'll see.
L443323	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
L443322	u7067	m473	JULIUS	What happened?
L443266	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
L443265	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's trying to form words.
L443264	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Huh?
L443263	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did you see that? It's remarkable!
L443261	u7067	m473	JULIUS	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
L443260	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
L443256	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
L443255	u7067	m473	JULIUS	You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
L443252	u7067	m473	JULIUS	No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
L443251	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
L443250	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Good morning, Dr. Zira.
L443220	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
L443219	u7068	m473	LANDON	We got off at the wrong stop.
L443209	u7068	m473	LANDON	Try telling them our names.
L443208	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No cigar.
L443201	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.
L443200	u7068	m473	LANDON	Can we take a dip?
L443197	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's take a look.
L443196	u7068	m473	LANDON	Scarecrows?
L443186	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
L443185	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	But I'm not prepared to die.
L443184	u7068	m473	LANDON	Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
L443183	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Don't bother
L443182	u7068	m473	LANDON	Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
L443181	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
L443179	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
L443178	u7068	m473	LANDON	Climb off me, will you!
L443177	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
L443175	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'm prepared to die.
L443174	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
L443173	u7068	m473	LANDON	All right --
L443170	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
L443169	u7068	m473	LANDON	If only we could get a fix.
L443154	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
L443153	u7068	m473	LANDON	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
L443152	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
L443151	u7068	m473	LANDON	long pause) You know it.
L443150	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
L443149	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	By our time.  You've turned gray.
L443148	u7068	m473	LANDON	Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
L443147	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
L443146	u7068	m473	LANDON	You don't seem very cut up about it.
L443145	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Air leak. Died in her sleep.
L443144	u7068	m473	LANDON	Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
L443143	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Join the expedition.
L443130	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
L443129	u7068	m473	LANDON	Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
L443128	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're here to stay.
L443127	u7068	m473	LANDON	Gone.
L443123	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Forget it. Abandon ship.
L443122	u7068	m473	LANDON	It's no use ... there she goes.
L443118	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	To Earth! That we've landed!
L443117	u7068	m473	LANDON	What signal?
L443116	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Send a last signal.
L443783	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
L443782	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What?
L443781	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
L443780	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	I think you're making a mistake.
L443779	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Lucius.
L443762	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
L443761	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
L443738	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Yes, I can do that.
L443737	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
L443736	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What is it?
L443735	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
L443734	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
L443733	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
L443694	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Relax. You'll see it all later.
L443693	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
L443692	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
L443659	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
L443658	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
L443653	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm for that.
L443652	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Shouldn't we be moving on?
L443585	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Fine. Just let her out.
L443584	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
L443583	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want her.
L443582	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Zira doesn't want your female.
L443581	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	She comes along too.
L443579	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Come on. Get me out of here.
L443578	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
L443577	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Who are you?
L443640	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	To scare off humans?
L443639	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The Hunt Club.
L443638	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Who put them up?
L443592	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
L443591	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Gorilla hunters ...
L443588	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
L443587	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	He wouldn't leave her.
L443586	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I told you not to bring the other one.
L443446	u7074	m473	ZIRA	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
L443445	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
L443444	u7074	m473	ZIRA	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
L443443	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
L443383	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We're -- conducting a new experiment.
L443382	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	Why special?
L443381	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
L443380	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
L443379	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A man, Dr. Maximus.
L443378	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	What is that?
L443514	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
L443513	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
L443494	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
L443493	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One is in a museum!
L443462	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
L443461	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
L443460	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
L443459	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My name is Taylor.
L443458	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
L443532	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
L443531	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443526	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
L443525	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	How so?
L443485	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
L443484	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	This is a joke in very poor taste.
L443483	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
L443482	u7074	m473	ZIRA	"'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""
L443481	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Read it yourself.
L443480	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
L443471	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
L443470	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Mind your tongue, madame.
L443469	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That?s a lie!
L443454	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
L443453	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
L443442	u7074	m473	ZIRA	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
L443441	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
L443790	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
L443789	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
L443788	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
L443787	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
L443786	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
L443785	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
L443769	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
L443768	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
L443766	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
L443765	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then there is another jungle?
L443753	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
L443752	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
L443729	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cease fire! Withdraw!
L443728	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Tell him to pull back!
L443723	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
L443722	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
L443691	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.Up to the cave.
L443690	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443689	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
L443688	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Twelve hundred years ago.
L443687	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
L443686	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What is your proposal?
L443683	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
L443682	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
L443667	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
L443666	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Stop right there.
L443566	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
L443565	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
L443564	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
L443563	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't know.
L443562	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
L443561	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
L443560	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
L443559	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then you admit --
L443558	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
L443557	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
L443556	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443555	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
L443553	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
L443552	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
L443551	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about it?
L443550	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
L443549	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
L443548	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You lied. Where is your tribe?
L443547	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
L443546	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
L443545	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
L443544	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No.
L443543	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
L443542	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about me?
L443505	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Identify him, then. Speak to him.
L443504	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	With one of them.
L443503	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
L443778	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	God bless you.
L443777	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
L443776	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
L443775	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
L443772	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's better than going to prison for heresy.
L443771	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We can't.
L443770	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Would you like to come along?
L443749	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
L443748	u7074	m473	ZIRA	It's humiliating.
L443747	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why not?
L443746	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
L443742	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, you can't.
L443741	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
L443710	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
L443709	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor! Tell him.
L443681	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
L443680	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please --
L443679	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
L443655	u7074	m473	ZIRA	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
L443654	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
L443637	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
L443636	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You want her that much?
L443635	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Maybe not.
L443634	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
L443633	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes.
L443632	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Are you going to take her with you?
L443619	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
L443618	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
L443590	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
L443589	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen-
L443510	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
L443509	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
L443508	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You! ... You knew about this?
L443502	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Second from the left.
L443501	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one?
L443500	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's him...Landon.
L443436	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A hearing.
L443435	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What is this?
L443434	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Shhhh!
L443433	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
L443281	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
L443280	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
L443278	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
L443277	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
L443259	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
L443258	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
L443799	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
L443798	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But the proof? The doll?
L443764	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
L443763	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
L443706	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What?
L443705	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But there's the doll, sir.
L443704	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
L443524	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
L443523	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
L443497	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
L443496	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He doesn't know.
L443495	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
L443492	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where are they now?
L443491	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This is his assertion.
L443490	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
L443489	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Like you, I find it difficult.
L443488	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Do you believe him?
L443487	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
L443486	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
L443385	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir.
L443384	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
L443288	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But perhaps he understood --
L443287	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
L443286	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's moving his fingers!
L450227	u7125	m478	BILLY	Something... in the trees...
L450226	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
L450150	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What about the rest of Hopper's men?
L450149	u7125	m478	BILLY	I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
L450148	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
L450147	u7125	m478	BILLY	Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
L450132	u7125	m478	BILLY	Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
L450131	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What do you mean?
L450130	u7125	m478	BILLY	Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
L450344	u7126	m478	DILLON	Right behind you.
L450343	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I'll see you there.
L450340	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You know you can't win this one.
L450339	u7126	m478	DILLON	Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
L450338	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	This isn't your style, Dillon.
L450337	u7126	m478	DILLON	No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
L450329	u7126	m478	DILLON	Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
L450328	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
L450323	u7126	m478	DILLON	That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
L450322	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We're not going.
L450321	u7126	m478	DILLON	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
L450320	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We're going to need everyone.
L450319	u7126	m478	DILLON	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L450311	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	No more games.
L450310	u7126	m478	DILLON	You're wastin' your time.
L450276	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
L450275	u7126	m478	DILLON	I can accept that, it comes with the job.
L450274	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
L450273	u7126	m478	DILLON	We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
L450255	u7126	m478	DILLON	The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
L450254	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
L450198	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
L450197	u7126	m478	DILLON	She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
L450184	u7126	m478	DILLON	We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
L450183	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What story did you give to Davis?
L450182	u7126	m478	DILLON	Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
L450181	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Why us?
L450180	u7126	m478	DILLON	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
L450179	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
L450143	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Well somebody sent them.
L450142	u7126	m478	DILLON	Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
L450141	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
L450134	u7126	m478	DILLON	Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
L450133	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Mean anything to you?
L450129	u7126	m478	DILLON	They're getting better equipped every day.
L450128	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
L450120	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
L450119	u7126	m478	DILLON	You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
L450113	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	This gets better by the minute.
L450112	u7126	m478	DILLON	No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
L450111	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Who's our back-up on this?
L450110	u7126	m478	DILLON	Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
L450098	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Go on.
L450097	u7126	m478	DILLON	Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
L450096	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
L450095	u7126	m478	DILLON	Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
L450094	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Like the old days, Dillon.
L450093	u7126	m478	DILLON	That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
L450092	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You never did know when to quit.
L450091	u7126	m478	DILLON	No way, old buddy.
L450090	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
L450356	u7126	m478	DILLON	We both got scores to settle.
L450355	u7127	m478	MAC	... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
L450354	u7126	m478	DILLON	Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
L450281	u7127	m478	MAC	Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
L450280	u7126	m478	DILLON	What, Sergeant?
L450279	u7127	m478	MAC	Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
L450212	u7127	m478	MAC	Anytime.
L450211	u7126	m478	DILLON	Thanks.
L450268	u7127	m478	MAC	The best friend I ever had.
L450267	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
L450266	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Thank you, Sergeant.
L450265	u7127	m478	MAC	We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
L450264	u7127	m478	MAC	I'll take him.
L450263	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
L450253	u7127	m478	MAC	I saw it.
L450252	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You saw what?
L450224	u7127	m478	MAC	Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
L450223	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's got Billy so spooked?
L450167	u7127	m478	MAC	We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
L450166	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Any sign of the hostages?
L450084	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	Someone else will be going in with you.
L450083	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's that, General?
L450082	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
L450080	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
L450079	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What have you got in mind, General.
L450078	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
L450077	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	That's over the border, General.
L450074	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	It's been a long time, General.
L450073	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	You're looking well, Dutch.
L450305	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
L450304	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	He knows our defenses.
L450303	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
L450241	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	There's no sign of it.
L450240	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Where the hell is his body?
L450239	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I think it's Hawkins.
L450238	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What in God's name...?
L450237	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I can't tell.
L450236	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Hawkins?
L450235	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Major, you'd better take a look at this.
L450137	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
L450136	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's he got?
L450125	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
L450124	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Mmmnnn...?
L450123	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	There's something else, Major...
L450122	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
L467152	u7247	m489	LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
L467151	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
L467109	u7247	m489	LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
L467108	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
L467101	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
L467100	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
L467099	u7247	m489	LANDO	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
L467098	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
L467022	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right. Stand by.
L467021	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
L467019	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
L467018	u7247	m489	LANDO	Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
L466818	u7242	m489	BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
L466817	u7249	m489	LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
L466816	u7242	m489	BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
L466815	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
L466814	u7242	m489	BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
L466813	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I have no sister.
L466812	u7242	m489	BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
L466811	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
L466810	u7242	m489	BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
L466809	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
L466808	u7242	m489	BEN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
L466807	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
L466806	u7242	m489	BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
L466805	u7249	m489	LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
L466804	u7242	m489	BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
L466803	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
L466802	u7242	m489	BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
L466801	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's still good in him.
L466796	u7242	m489	BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
L466795	u7249	m489	LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
L466793	u7242	m489	BEN	Yoda will always be with you.
L466792	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
L466672	u7245	m489	HAN	Who are you?
L466671	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
L466670	u7245	m489	HAN	Where am I?
L466669	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
L466668	u7245	m489	HAN	I can't see.
L466667	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
L467037	u7252	m489	VADER	His lightsaber.
L467036	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
L466915	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
L466914	u7252	m489	VADER	They are clear, my Master.
L466913	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
L466912	u7252	m489	VADER	I have felt him, my Master.
L466911	u7252	m489	VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
L466910	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
L466857	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466856	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
L466855	u7252	m489	VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
L466854	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
L466853	u7252	m489	VADER	What is thy bidding, my Master?
L466772	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
L466771	u7252	m489	VADER	As you wish.
L466770	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
L466769	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466768	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
L466767	u7252	m489	VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
L466950	u7249	m489	LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
L466949	u7245	m489	HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
L466930	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right.
L466929	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey!
L466926	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, sure.
L466925	u7249	m489	LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
L466924	u7245	m489	HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
L466893	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
L466892	u7245	m489	HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
L466890	u7249	m489	LUKE	We got separated.
L466889	u7245	m489	HAN	I thought she was with you.
L466879	u7249	m489	LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
L466878	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
L466867	u7245	m489	HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
L466866	u7249	m489	LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
L466865	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
L466864	u7245	m489	HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
L466863	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
L466850	u7249	m489	LUKE	All set.
L466849	u7245	m489	HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
L466845	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
L466844	u7245	m489	HAN	You got her warmed?
L466837	u7249	m489	LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
L466836	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke.
L466759	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
L466758	u7245	m489	HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
L466721	u7245	m489	HAN	Oh... great!
L466720	u7249	m489	LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
L466719	u7245	m489	HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
L466718	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
L466717	u7245	m489	HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
L466709	u7245	m489	HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
L466708	u7249	m489	LUKE	The same as always.
L466707	u7245	m489	HAN	How are we doing?
L466706	u7249	m489	LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
L466705	u7245	m489	HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
L466704	u7249	m489	LUKE	Are you all right?
L466703	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke!
L466702	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han!
L467183	u7245	m489	HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
L467182	u7248	m489	LEIA	Yes.
L467181	u7245	m489	HAN	You love him, don't you?
L467180	u7248	m489	LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
L467179	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
L467081	u7245	m489	HAN	Here's the terminal.
L467080	u7248	m489	LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
L467048	u7245	m489	HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
L467047	u7248	m489	LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
L467015	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
L467014	u7248	m489	LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
L466995	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hold me.
L466994	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sorry.
L466993	u7245	m489	HAN	Ahhh...
L466992	u7248	m489	LEIA	I...
L466960	u7248	m489	LEIA	I don't know.
L466959	u7245	m489	HAN	What's going on?
L466877	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
L466876	u7248	m489	LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
L466862	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
L466861	u7248	m489	LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
L466848	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
L466847	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
L466756	u7248	m489	LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
L466755	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
L466675	u7248	m489	LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
L466674	u7245	m489	HAN	Leia!
L466673	u7248	m489	LEIA	Someone who loves you.
L466843	u7245	m489	HAN	You, too.
L466842	u7247	m489	LANDO	Good luck.
L466840	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
L466839	u7245	m489	HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
L466820	u7247	m489	LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
L466819	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
L466761	u7247	m489	LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
L466760	u7245	m489	HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
L466746	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
L466745	u7245	m489	HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
L466744	u7247	m489	LANDO	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
L466743	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
L466737	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm trying!
L466736	u7247	m489	LANDO	Lower it!
L466735	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando, grab it!
L466733	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando!
L466732	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han! Chewie?
L467118	u7245	m489	HAN	Let's see.
L467117	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
L467106	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
L467105	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
L467104	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Artoo, hurry!
L467103	u7245	m489	HAN	Come on! Come on!
L467102	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	We're coming!
L466945	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
L466944	u7245	m489	HAN	What did he say?
L466940	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
L466939	u7245	m489	HAN	Proper?!
L466938	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
L466937	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
L466936	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
L466935	u7245	m489	HAN	What are you telling them?
L466852	u7245	m489	HAN	All right, hang on.
L466851	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Here we go again.
L466715	u7245	m489	HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
L466714	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
L466713	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
L466712	u7245	m489	HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
L466711	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
L466619	u7252	m489	VADER	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
L466618	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
L466617	u7252	m489	VADER	That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
L466616	u7252	m489	VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
L466615	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
L466614	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
L466613	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
L466612	u7252	m489	VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
L466611	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
L466610	u7252	m489	VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
L466609	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
L467176	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
L467175	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
L467174	u7253	m489	WEDGE	There it is!
L467160	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
L467159	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
L467158	u7247	m489	LANDO	Here goes nothing.
L467157	u7253	m489	WEDGE	I'm going in.
L467137	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
L467136	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Good shot, Red Two.
L467052	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.
L467051	u7247	m489	LANDO	All wings report in.
L467028	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh, no.
L467027	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
L467026	u7248	m489	LEIA	Quiet.
L467025	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
L467017	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
L467016	u7248	m489	LEIA	What's he saying?
L466947	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.
L466946	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh!
L466682	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
L466681	u7248	m489	LEIA	Ugh!
L466988	u7249	m489	LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
L466987	u7248	m489	LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
L466986	u7249	m489	LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
L466985	u7248	m489	LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
L466984	u7249	m489	LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
L466983	u7248	m489	LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
L466982	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
L466981	u7249	m489	LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
L466980	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
L466979	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
L466978	u7248	m489	LEIA	Your father?
L466977	u7249	m489	LUKE	He's my father.
L466974	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
L466973	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
L466972	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
L466971	u7248	m489	LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
L466970	u7249	m489	LUKE	Tell me.
L466969	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
L466968	u7249	m489	LUKE	What do you remember?
L466967	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
L466966	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
L466882	u7249	m489	LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia!
L466881	u7248	m489	LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
L467146	u7249	m489	LUKE	Never-r-r!
L467145	u7252	m489	VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
L467144	u7252	m489	VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
L467143	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you.
L467142	u7252	m489	VADER	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
L467133	u7252	m489	VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
L467132	u7249	m489	LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
L467131	u7252	m489	VADER	There is no conflict.
L467130	u7249	m489	LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
L467128	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
L467127	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
L467012	u7252	m489	VADER	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
L467011	u7249	m489	LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
L467010	u7252	m489	VADER	If that is your destiny.
L467009	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
L467008	u7252	m489	VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
L467007	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
L467006	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come with me.
L467002	u7252	m489	VADER	So, you have accepted the truth.
L467001	u7249	m489	LUKE	I know, father.
L467000	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
L466790	u7254	m489	YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
L466789	u7249	m489	LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
L466788	u7249	m489	LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
L466787	u7254	m489	YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
L466786	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes.
L466785	u7254	m489	YODA	Told you, did he?
L466784	u7254	m489	YODA	Your father he is.
L466783	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
L466779	u7254	m489	YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
L466778	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
L466777	u7254	m489	YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
L466776	u7249	m489	LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
L466653	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Disintegrated?
L466652	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
L466651	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
L466650	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
L466649	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh. Well, yes.
L466648	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
L466647	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
L466646	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
L519214	u7706	m521	CHURCH	"Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    ""No""? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead."
L519213	u7707	m521	MEKUM	"Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean ""AQ""...""aggressive qualities""?"

MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a ""platform"" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a ""platform"" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...

L519204	u7706	m521	CHURCH	Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
L519203	u7707	m521	MEKUM	Such as?
L519202	u7706	m521	CHURCH	The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
L519201	u7707	m521	MEKUM	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
L519200	u7706	m521	CHURCH	"Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these ""hot shots"" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?"
L519199	u7707	m521	MEKUM	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
L519198	u7706	m521	CHURCH	"...He used to say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."""

L519196	u7707	m521	MEKUM	As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
L519195	u7706	m521	CHURCH	Improved...how?
L525956	u7776	m526	ANNA	They're not going to make it!
L525955	u7787	m526	WARREN	Jesus, come on!
L525878	u7787	m526	WARREN	Anna...
L525877	u7776	m526	ANNA	Anna...
L525876	u7787	m526	WARREN	Oh Sara...
L525875	u7776	m526	ANNA	Oh yeah...
L525874	u7787	m526	WARREN	Oh yeah...
L525873	u7776	m526	ANNA	Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
L525820	u7787	m526	WARREN	Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
L525819	u7776	m526	ANNA	I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
L525818	u7787	m526	WARREN	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
L525817	u7776	m526	ANNA	I think we're moving.
L525778	u7787	m526	WARREN	Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
L525777	u7776	m526	ANNA	Getting drunk is no solution.
L525756	u7787	m526	WARREN	I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
L525755	u7776	m526	ANNA	Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
L525716	u7787	m526	WARREN	He's shutting off the air!!!
L525715	u7776	m526	ANNA	Oh my God, what is he doing?
L525435	u7776	m526	ANNA	Very professional of you.
L525434	u7788	m526	WAYNE	No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
L525368	u7776	m526	ANNA	I'm sure I will.
L525367	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
L525366	u7776	m526	ANNA	It certainly is.
L525365	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
L525364	u7776	m526	ANNA	Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
L525363	u7788	m526	WAYNE	So...
L525362	u7776	m526	ANNA	Of course, of course...
L525361	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
L525360	u7776	m526	ANNA	So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
L525359	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Well I appreciate that.
L525358	u7776	m526	ANNA	Magnificent, magnificent.
L525357	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Oh, thank you.
L525356	u7776	m526	ANNA	My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
L525355	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
L525354	u7776	m526	ANNA	Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
L525353	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
L525352	u7776	m526	ANNA	You're Warren Wayne.
L525351	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Excuse me?
L525350	u7776	m526	ANNA	It can't be.
L525349	u7788	m526	WAYNE	Evening.
L525713	u7777	m526	BARNES	And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
L525711	u7777	m526	BARNES	I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
L525710	u7782	m526	MAC	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
L525708	u7782	m526	MAC	My...wings...
L525707	u7777	m526	BARNES	Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
L525692	u7782	m526	MAC	The device has stopped responding.
L525691	u7777	m526	BARNES	On channel 10?
L525689	u7777	m526	BARNES	Well you did the right thing Mac.
L525688	u7782	m526	MAC	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
L525687	u7777	m526	BARNES	Were you going to give it to them?
L525686	u7782	m526	MAC	They are awaiting further information.
L525685	u7777	m526	BARNES	And what are they doing now, Mac?
L525684	u7782	m526	MAC	I did nothing to the monitors.
L525683	u7777	m526	BARNES	You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
L525682	u7782	m526	MAC	Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
L525681	u7777	m526	BARNES	Oh he did, did he?
L525680	u7782	m526	MAC	I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
L525679	u7777	m526	BARNES	Weren't you down in the dining room?
L525671	u7782	m526	MAC	Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
L525670	u7777	m526	BARNES	Where the hell did you come from?
L525485	u7785	m526	REYNOLDS	Well shut it off at once!
L525484	u7777	m526	BARNES	All too well, captain.
L525479	u7785	m526	REYNOLDS	Look answer my question!
L525478	u7777	m526	BARNES	It's a little late for you to be up.
L525477	u7785	m526	REYNOLDS	What did you say to me?
L525338	u7777	m526	BARNES	Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
L525337	u7785	m526	REYNOLDS	Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
L525336	u7777	m526	BARNES	Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
L525897	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Good help is hard to find...
L525896	u7777	m526	BARNES	Idiot...
L525701	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
L525700	u7777	m526	BARNES	I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
L525699	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
L525698	u7777	m526	BARNES	Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
L525697	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't know what you're talking about!
L525695	u7777	m526	BARNES	Taylor, you surprise me.
L525694	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
L525607	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Will you transmit the distress signal?
L525606	u7777	m526	BARNES	That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
L525605	u7777	m526	BARNES	Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
L525604	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
L525603	u7777	m526	BARNES	Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
L525532	u7777	m526	BARNES	Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
L525531	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
L525515	u7777	m526	BARNES	I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
L525514	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
L525513	u7777	m526	BARNES	Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
L525512	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	You better start making sense!
L525511	u7777	m526	BARNES	Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
L525507	u7777	m526	BARNES	Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
L525506	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
L525505	u7777	m526	BARNES	Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
L525504	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
L525503	u7777	m526	BARNES	The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
L525502	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	What is the condition of the bridge?
L525501	u7777	m526	BARNES	Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
L525500	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
L525498	u7777	m526	BARNES	That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
L525497	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	If anyone can hear me please respond!
L525495	u7777	m526	BARNES	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
L525494	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
L525463	u7777	m526	BARNES	I can hardly wait.
L525462	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
L525461	u7777	m526	BARNES	No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
L525460	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
L525459	u7777	m526	BARNES	I think I can handle it.
L525458	u7777	m526	BARNES	Uh...
L525457	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
L525456	u7777	m526	BARNES	Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
L525455	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
L525454	u7777	m526	BARNES	Thank you.
L525453	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
L525452	u7777	m526	BARNES	You gotta think of your old age.
L525451	u7777	m526	BARNES	It's steady, good benefits.
L525450	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	You want to go back to shuttle work?
L525449	u7777	m526	BARNES	Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
L525448	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Why, didn't they say?
L525447	u7777	m526	BARNES	I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
L525446	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	So, are you on for the next one?
L525445	u7777	m526	BARNES	Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
L525444	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
L525384	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	All right, I'll give it a shot.
L525383	u7777	m526	BARNES	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
L525382	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	You're certain of that?
L525381	u7777	m526	BARNES	Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
L525380	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
L525379	u7777	m526	BARNES	There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
L525378	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
L525377	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well it's a good thing that I did.
L525376	u7777	m526	BARNES	No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
L525342	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
L525341	u7777	m526	BARNES	Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
L525895	u7777	m526	BARNES	Over and out!
L525894	u7784	m526	PILOT	Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
L525893	u7777	m526	BARNES	Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
L525892	u7784	m526	PILOT	That's clear.
L525891	u7777	m526	BARNES	Is that clear?
L525888	u7784	m526	PILOT	This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
L525887	u7777	m526	BARNES	Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
L525885	u7777	m526	BARNES	Let's get something straight, Chappy!
L525884	u7784	m526	PILOT	Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
L525883	u7777	m526	BARNES	I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
L525882	u7784	m526	PILOT	Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
L525862	u7777	m526	BARNES	Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
L525861	u7784	m526	PILOT	Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
L525860	u7777	m526	BARNES	This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
L525859	u7777	m526	BARNES	The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
L525858	u7784	m526	PILOT	You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
L525809	u7784	m526	PILOT	Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
L525808	u7777	m526	BARNES	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
L525807	u7784	m526	PILOT	So, what are we waiting for?
L525806	u7777	m526	BARNES	I know, I know.
L525805	u7784	m526	PILOT	It's time we lock coordinates.
L525594	u7784	m526	PILOT	10-4 good buddy.
L525593	u7777	m526	BARNES	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
L525592	u7784	m526	PILOT	Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
L525591	u7777	m526	BARNES	I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
L525590	u7784	m526	PILOT	Will do.  What about the distress signal?
L525589	u7777	m526	BARNES	Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
L525588	u7784	m526	PILOT	Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
L525587	u7777	m526	BARNES	Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
L525586	u7784	m526	PILOT	Break it down to me, what's going on?
L525585	u7777	m526	BARNES	That's me.
L525584	u7784	m526	PILOT	Barnes?
L525864	u7781	m526	JACK	Just don't move around too much.
L525863	u7778	m526	CARLO	It's getting hard to breathe...
L525748	u7781	m526	JACK	Will you shut up already?
L525747	u7778	m526	CARLO	We're going to die.
L525726	u7781	m526	JACK	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
L525725	u7778	m526	CARLO	What's the use...we're gonna die...
L525410	u7781	m526	JACK	I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
L525409	u7778	m526	CARLO	Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
L525408	u7781	m526	JACK	Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
L525407	u7778	m526	CARLO	Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
L525406	u7781	m526	JACK	Like that piece of ass he was with.
L525405	u7778	m526	CARLO	No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
L525404	u7781	m526	JACK	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
L525403	u7778	m526	CARLO	Look at this...Jesus.
L525994	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't know.  Wave to them!
L525993	u7779	m526	DAWN	What is it?!
L525990	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Try not to think about it.
L525989	u7779	m526	DAWN	Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
L525984	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
L525983	u7779	m526	DAWN	In that case, I accept.
L525982	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It would matter to us.
L525981	u7779	m526	DAWN	I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
L525980	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	That's right.  Will you marry me?
L525979	u7779	m526	DAWN	Marry you?
L525978	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Will you marry me?
L525976	u7779	m526	DAWN	Except write our wills.
L525975	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
L525974	u7779	m526	DAWN	I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
L525962	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	And so far.
L525961	u7779	m526	DAWN	So close...
L525952	u7779	m526	DAWN	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
L525951	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	What do you mean?  What happened!
L525950	u7779	m526	DAWN	We have room!  Let's go!
L525949	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	What the hell are you doing?
L525914	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Over and out.
L525913	u7779	m526	DAWN	Sooner than later.
L525912	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Hopefully sooner than later.
L525911	u7779	m526	DAWN	Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
L525910	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
L525909	u7779	m526	DAWN	So what's going to happen to you?
L525908	u7779	m526	DAWN	I'll do my best.
L525907	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
L525906	u7779	m526	DAWN	How does the distress signal look?
L525905	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
L525904	u7779	m526	DAWN	I'm about to blow the wall.
L525903	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
L525902	u7779	m526	DAWN	Barnes?
L525901	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I'm in the bridge.
L525900	u7779	m526	DAWN	Taylor!  Where are you?
L525899	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Dawn.  Come in.
L525857	u7779	m526	DAWN	You too.
L525856	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
L525851	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I can't!
L525850	u7779	m526	DAWN	But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
L525849	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
L525848	u7779	m526	DAWN	But how are you going to escape?
L525847	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
L525846	u7779	m526	DAWN	And what are you going to do?!
L525845	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
L525844	u7779	m526	DAWN	What?  What are you talking about?
L525843	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I'm not going with you.
L525842	u7779	m526	DAWN	Why?  Where are you going?
L525841	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
L525838	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	No...
L525837	u7779	m526	DAWN	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
L525836	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Take this flare.
L525833	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
L525832	u7779	m526	DAWN	We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
L525831	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
L525830	u7779	m526	DAWN	What's that?
L525828	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
L525827	u7779	m526	DAWN	Oh my God.  What happened?
L525826	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
L525825	u7779	m526	DAWN	I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
L525815	u7779	m526	DAWN	Helllp!
L525814	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Dawn!  Dawn!
L525801	u7779	m526	DAWN	Words to live by.
L525800	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
L525799	u7779	m526	DAWN	Sure.
L525798	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Do you want some advice?
L525797	u7779	m526	DAWN	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
L525796	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
L525795	u7779	m526	DAWN	What do you think's going to happen to us?
L525794	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Yeah?
L525793	u7779	m526	DAWN	Taylor?
L525790	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
L525789	u7779	m526	DAWN	Explosive?
L525786	u7779	m526	DAWN	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
L525785	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
L525770	u7779	m526	DAWN	At this point I'm ready for anything.
L525769	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	You're ready for the real thing?
L525767	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	So we did.
L525766	u7779	m526	DAWN	Yeah.  We did it.
L525763	u7779	m526	DAWN	Ready as I'll ever be.
L525762	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Are you ready?
L525761	u7779	m526	DAWN	I understand.
L525760	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't know what we're facing.
L525740	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Simulated space walking.
L525739	u7779	m526	DAWN	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
L525738	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I can't let you do that.
L525736	u7779	m526	DAWN	Wait.
L525735	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Everyone just stay put.
L525731	u7779	m526	DAWN	Even if we do, it might be too late.
L525730	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
L525662	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
L525661	u7779	m526	DAWN	It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
L525656	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Close every door behind you!
L525655	u7779	m526	DAWN	He certainly is polite.
L525650	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	You're right.
L525649	u7779	m526	DAWN	We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
L525648	u7779	m526	DAWN	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
L525647	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	And suppose you couldn't hold out?
L525645	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
L525644	u7779	m526	DAWN	Why can't we?
L525643	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
L525613	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Great.
L525612	u7779	m526	DAWN	Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
L525611	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Seen one like it before?
L525610	u7779	m526	DAWN	OK...it's open.
L525579	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
L525578	u7779	m526	DAWN	Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
L525577	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
L525576	u7779	m526	DAWN	Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
L525548	u7779	m526	DAWN	Just considering our options... sir.
L525547	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
L525546	u7779	m526	DAWN	Well maybe we can do something like that.
L525545	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Probably come through the wall I suppose.
L525544	u7779	m526	DAWN	Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
L525543	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
L525542	u7779	m526	DAWN	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
L525541	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	We don't.
L525538	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I don't know.
L525537	u7779	m526	DAWN	What are we going to do?
L525401	u7779	m526	DAWN	Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
L525400	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Really?
L525399	u7779	m526	DAWN	Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
L525398	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I'm sure you'll be all right.
L525397	u7779	m526	DAWN	Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
L525396	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
L525395	u7779	m526	DAWN	Like open an airlock by mistake?
L525394	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
L525393	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
L525392	u7779	m526	DAWN	So you were looking for a new challenge.
L525391	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
L525390	u7779	m526	DAWN	Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
L525389	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
L525388	u7779	m526	DAWN	That's right.
L525387	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
L525626	u7782	m526	MAC	That is one of my priorities.
L525625	u7779	m526	DAWN	Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
L525310	u7782	m526	MAC	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
L525309	u7779	m526	DAWN	So I've been told.
L525308	u7782	m526	MAC	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
L525307	u7779	m526	DAWN	No, just enjoying the view.
L525306	u7782	m526	MAC	Is there anything I can help you with?
L525305	u7779	m526	DAWN	Thank you.
L525304	u7782	m526	MAC	Congratulations on your...recent award.
L525303	u7779	m526	DAWN	I'm fine.
L525943	u7781	m526	JACK	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
L525942	u7779	m526	DAWN	I'm going back for Taylor!
L525927	u7781	m526	JACK	He's in the bathroom.
L525926	u7779	m526	DAWN	Carlo!
L525923	u7779	m526	DAWN	He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
L525922	u7781	m526	JACK	Where's Taylor?
L525921	u7779	m526	DAWN	There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
L525920	u7781	m526	JACK	What is happening around here!!!
L525868	u7783	m526	MONICA	How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
L525867	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Baby, take it easy.
L525866	u7783	m526	MONICA	It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
L525557	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Talk to him...Jesus...
L525556	u7783	m526	MONICA	You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
L525555	u7780	m526	DELBERT	How am I supposed to know?
L525554	u7783	m526	MONICA	Well now what are we gonna do!
L525419	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Send it back if you don't want it.
L525418	u7783	m526	MONICA	Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
L525331	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
L525330	u7783	m526	MONICA	I guess so.
L525329	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
L525328	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
L525327	u7783	m526	MONICA	How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
L525326	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
L525325	u7783	m526	MONICA	We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
L525324	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Homesick?  It's only been two days!
L525323	u7783	m526	MONICA	I'm homesick.
L525813	u7781	m526	JACK	The engines!
L525812	u7780	m526	DELBERT	What the hell is that?
L525773	u7780	m526	DELBERT	What makes you so sure?
L525772	u7781	m526	JACK	Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
L525771	u7780	m526	DELBERT	I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
L525754	u7781	m526	JACK	What are you going to do about it?
L525753	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
L525752	u7781	m526	JACK	I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
L525751	u7780	m526	DELBERT	I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
L525568	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
L525567	u7781	m526	JACK	You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
L525566	u7780	m526	DELBERT	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
L525565	u7781	m526	JACK	Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
L525660	u7782	m526	MAC	That's affirmative.
L525659	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Is it safe for human transport?
L525658	u7782	m526	MAC	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
L525657	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	How is it looking, Mac?
L525654	u7782	m526	MAC	Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
L525653	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
L525642	u7782	m526	MAC	I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
L525641	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
L525639	u7782	m526	MAC	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
L525638	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
L525634	u7782	m526	MAC	One moment please...  one moment please...
L525633	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
L525623	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I know but we're in a bind.
L525622	u7782	m526	MAC	Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
L525621	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
L525620	u7782	m526	MAC	That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
L525619	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
L525618	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Right, I understand that...
L525617	u7782	m526	MAC	Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
L525616	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
L525615	u7782	m526	MAC	Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
L525614	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
L525465	u7786	m526	TAYLOR	Mac.  What's shaking?
L525464	u7782	m526	MAC	Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
L526896	u7805	m528	BARNES	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
L526895	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Open it, Captain!
L526894	u7805	m528	BARNES	... Your civil rights have been overridden!
L526892	u7805	m528	BARNES	Please, Dr. Levine.
L526891	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
L526890	u7805	m528	BARNES	Calm down, Dr. Levine.
L526889	u7804	m528	ARTHUR	Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
L527286	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't...
L527285	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher!  Now!
L527284	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	I can't see...
L527283	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there!
L527282	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	It's burning...
L527281	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, get away from there...
L527277	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher, I want you back here.
L527276	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
L527273	u7808	m528	FLETCHER	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
L527272	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
L527585	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it, damn it!
L527584	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, please!  Don't!
L527583	u7805	m528	BARNES	Now!
L527582	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it!
L527580	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman, don't do it!
L527579	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
L527578	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
L527575	u7805	m528	BARNES	Do you see it?
L527574	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't do it, Norman!
L527564	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's either that or we grow gills.
L527563	u7806	m528	BETH	That's our reserve air.
L527562	u7805	m528	BARNES	Increase positive pressure!
L527559	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's right beneath us.
L527558	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527557	u7805	m528	BARNES	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
L527556	u7806	m528	BETH	Where is it?
L527552	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
L527551	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thirty yards.
L527550	u7805	m528	BARNES	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
L527549	u7806	m528	BETH	But you've tested it?
L527548	u7805	m528	BARNES	Forty yards.
L527547	u7805	m528	BARNES	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
L527546	u7806	m528	BETH	High Voltage?
L527545	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
L527544	u7806	m528	BETH	What do we use for defense?
L527543	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fifty yards and closing.
L527542	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it attacks?
L527541	u7805	m528	BARNES	A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
L527537	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?
L527536	u7805	m528	BARNES	Direction's east coming!
L527530	u7805	m528	BARNES	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
L527529	u7806	m528	BETH	Nice work, Captain sir.
L527491	u7805	m528	BARNES	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
L527490	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
L527289	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move!
L527288	u7806	m528	BETH	But she's --
L527287	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody move.
L527249	u7806	m528	BETH	Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
L527248	u7805	m528	BARNES	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
L527247	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah.  I heard you.
L527246	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
L527224	u7806	m528	BETH	Two and a half days?
L527223	u7805	m528	BARNES	They told me about sixty hours.
L527222	u7806	m528	BETH	How long will that be?
L527221	u7805	m528	BARNES	The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
L527198	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
L527197	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527191	u7805	m528	BARNES	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
L527190	u7806	m528	BETH	I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
L527110	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
L527109	u7806	m528	BETH	Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
L527007	u7806	m528	BETH	How about I just press the button?
L527006	u7805	m528	BARNES	Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
L526999	u7806	m528	BETH	Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
L526998	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526997	u7806	m528	BETH	Hold on --
L526988	u7806	m528	BETH	Would you wait a minute?
L526987	u7805	m528	BARNES	I said back away.
L526986	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a minute --
L526985	u7805	m528	BARNES	Back away then.
L526984	u7806	m528	BETH	There's heat coming the door.
L526854	u7805	m528	BARNES	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
L526853	u7806	m528	BETH	In basic English, what does all this mean?
L526845	u7805	m528	BARNES	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
L526844	u7806	m528	BETH	How big is this spacecraft?
L527577	u7805	m528	BARNES	Pull it.
L527576	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I see it.
L527571	u7805	m528	BARNES	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
L527570	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, sir.  I'm here.
L527555	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
L527554	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
L527553	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell?  It shut us down.
L527539	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Jerry?
L527538	u7805	m528	BARNES	Going active.
L527527	u7805	m528	BARNES	No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
L527526	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
L527525	u7805	m528	BARNES	Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
L527524	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
L527523	u7805	m528	BARNES	You think he killed Edmunds?
L527520	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
L527519	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't want you talking to Jerry.
L527488	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
L527487	u7805	m528	BARNES	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
L527486	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What for?
L527454	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Can you copy?
L527453	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
L527452	u7805	m528	BARNES	Damn it, Edmunds?
L527451	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
L527450	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527422	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
L527421	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't think weapons are important?
L527420	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
L527419	u7805	m528	BARNES	Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
L527379	u7805	m528	BARNES	What am I -- a dog, now?
L527378	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
L527377	u7805	m528	BARNES	"He translated it wrong.  ""My name is Jerry""?  It's like ""See Spot run."""
L527338	u7805	m528	BARNES	"-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, ""When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."""
L527337	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- I didn't know it would come to this --
L527336	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- and then brought her down here --
L527335	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second --
L527334	u7805	m528	BARNES	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
L527333	u7811	m528	NORMAN	At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
L527332	u7805	m528	BARNES	So you knew this when you wrote your report?
L527331	u7811	m528	NORMAN	'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
L527330	u7805	m528	BARNES	When was this?
L527329	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
L527328	u7805	m528	BARNES	She should've known better.
L527327	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
L527326	u7805	m528	BARNES	I think I do.
L527325	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't want to know.
L527324	u7805	m528	BARNES	How drastic?
L527323	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
L527182	u7805	m528	BARNES	"No ""buts"".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit."
L527181	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir --
L527180	u7805	m528	BARNES	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
L527179	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
L527161	u7805	m528	BARNES	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
L527160	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
L527159	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you mean, he's missing?
L527158	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry's missing.
L527152	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just worry about yourself.
L527151	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
L527150	u7805	m528	BARNES	Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
L527149	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
L527148	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't get hysterical, Norman.
L527108	u7805	m528	BARNES	Everything can be killed.
L527107	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.  That's the point.
L527106	u7805	m528	BARNES	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
L527105	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
L527104	u7805	m528	BARNES	"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"
L527095	u7811	m528	NORMAN	If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
L527094	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527093	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Maybe we shouldn't.
L527076	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
L527075	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Picked up something?  What is it?
L526977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Take a look.
L526976	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it, Norman?
L526921	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
L526920	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's wrong with oxygen?
L526919	u7805	m528	BARNES	They pressurize us with helium.
L526843	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
L526842	u7805	m528	BARNES	Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
L526841	u7811	m528	NORMAN	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
L526840	u7805	m528	BARNES	The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
L526839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526838	u7805	m528	BARNES	We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
L526837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It doesn't make any sense.
L526836	u7805	m528	BARNES	Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
L526835	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
L526834	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's impossible.
L526833	u7805	m528	BARNES	Extraordinary, isn't it?
L526832	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
L526831	u7805	m528	BARNES	Maybe older --
L526830	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on --
L526829	u7805	m528	BARNES	-- dating the crash at least that old.
L526828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	-- Wait a second --
L526827	u7805	m528	BARNES	Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
L526826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?
L526825	u7805	m528	BARNES	See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
L526823	u7805	m528	BARNES	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
L526822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
L526821	u7805	m528	BARNES	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
L526820	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
L526817	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you need me for?
L526816	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L526815	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why am I here?
L526814	u7805	m528	BARNES	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
L526813	u7811	m528	NORMAN	A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
L526812	u7805	m528	BARNES	A thousand feet.
L526811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How deep is he?
L526809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They didn't tell me anything.
L526808	u7805	m528	BARNES	A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
L526807	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Storm?  What storm?
L526806	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're moving fast considering the storm.
L526805	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
L526804	u7811	m528	NORMAN	From what?  What's with all the security?
L526803	u7805	m528	BARNES	Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
L526802	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Press?  No, I haven't.
L526801	u7805	m528	BARNES	You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
L526798	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nothing else.
L526797	u7805	m528	BARNES	Anything else?
L526796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
L526795	u7805	m528	BARNES	What have you been told so far?
L526794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What team?
L526793	u7805	m528	BARNES	Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
L526792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
L526791	u7805	m528	BARNES	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
L526790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
L526789	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
L526788	u7805	m528	BARNES	Captain.
L526787	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you, Colonel.
L527381	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In a minute, sir.
L527380	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
L527212	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
L527211	u7805	m528	BARNES	Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
L527207	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
L527206	u7805	m528	BARNES	They've left, keep watching!
L527205	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
L527201	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	In the ship, sir.
L527200	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, where the fuck is he?
L527199	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Yes, sir.
L527193	u7805	m528	BARNES	What the hell is going on here?
L527192	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527187	u7805	m528	BARNES	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
L527186	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing, sir.
L527185	u7805	m528	BARNES	Any sign of Harry?
L527184	u7805	m528	BARNES	They're coming.
L527183	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
L527178	u7805	m528	BARNES	Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
L527177	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Subs are still at surface, sir.
L527173	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry?  Can you copy?
L527172	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
L527143	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
L527142	u7805	m528	BARNES	What caused it?
L526936	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
L526935	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
L526934	u7805	m528	BARNES	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
L526933	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	It's not sucking, sir.
L526929	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Working on it now, sir.
L526928	u7805	m528	BARNES	Can you open that panel?
L527443	u7809	m528	HARRY	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
L527442	u7805	m528	BARNES	She wired this system.
L527441	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know.
L527440	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
L527416	u7809	m528	HARRY	What -- you want me to retype it?
L527415	u7805	m528	BARNES	"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."
L527414	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm in charge.
L527413	u7809	m528	HARRY	"He's saying, ""Take me to your leader."" He wants to know who's in charge."
L527412	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527408	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's not gonna know, sir.
L527407	u7805	m528	BARNES	Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
L527400	u7809	m528	HARRY	He understands me fine.
L527399	u7805	m528	BARNES	Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
L527397	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not ignorant.
L527396	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
L527375	u7805	m528	BARNES	How do you mean, strange?
L527374	u7809	m528	HARRY	I have to tell you.  It's strange.
L527373	u7805	m528	BARNES	What's the message?
L527372	u7809	m528	HARRY	"... spiralling out of the center, you see: ""G"" is one, ""B"" is two, ""H"" is three, and so on... when I got the message."
L527341	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
L527340	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
L527169	u7809	m528	HARRY	Please watch your closest monitor...
L527168	u7805	m528	BARNES	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
L527167	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ladies and Gentlemen...
L527166	u7805	m528	BARNES	Gimme a report, I want --
L527117	u7805	m528	BARNES	Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
L527116	u7809	m528	HARRY	Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
L527115	u7805	m528	BARNES	You don't know that.
L527114	u7809	m528	HARRY	It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
L527113	u7805	m528	BARNES	Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
L527101	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
L527100	u7805	m528	BARNES	So?  What's the problem?
L527097	u7805	m528	BARNES	The what?
L527096	u7809	m528	HARRY	Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
L527092	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted seems to have some ideas.
L527091	u7805	m528	BARNES	So how do we get it open?
L527089	u7805	m528	BARNES	A break for what?
L527088	u7809	m528	HARRY	To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
L527087	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?
L527086	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
L527074	u7805	m528	BARNES	So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
L527073	u7809	m528	HARRY	We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
L527072	u7805	m528	BARNES	Yes, Harry.
L527071	u7809	m528	HARRY	Ted?  Captain?
L526983	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then how can it be chipped?
L526982	u7805	m528	BARNES	I did.
L526981	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
L526980	u7805	m528	BARNES	I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
L526979	u7809	m528	HARRY	Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
L526978	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's chipped.
L526851	u7805	m528	BARNES	I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
L526850	u7809	m528	HARRY	Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
L526849	u7805	m528	BARNES	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
L526848	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much damage?
L527485	u7805	m528	BARNES	"In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the ""delay"" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes."
L527484	u7814	m528	TED	What sub?
L527483	u7805	m528	BARNES	Resetting the sub.
L527482	u7814	m528	TED	What was Edmunds doing outside?
L527481	u7805	m528	BARNES	Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
L527467	u7814	m528	TED	Too big?
L527466	u7805	m528	BARNES	It won't register.  It's too big to image.
L527465	u7814	m528	TED	What?
L527464	u7805	m528	BARNES	The sensors are picking up something outside.
L527463	u7814	m528	TED	What is that?
L527447	u7814	m528	TED	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
L527446	u7805	m528	BARNES	Edmunds?
L527392	u7814	m528	TED	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
L527391	u7805	m528	BARNES	It's not talking, it's mimicking.
L527384	u7805	m528	BARNES	I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
L527383	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
L527382	u7805	m528	BARNES	I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
L527349	u7814	m528	TED	What's inside the sphere.
L527348	u7805	m528	BARNES	From the sphere?
L527275	u7805	m528	BARNES	Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
L527274	u7814	m528	TED	She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
L527219	u7805	m528	BARNES	Internal power.
L527218	u7814	m528	TED	To what?
L527217	u7805	m528	BARNES	They switched us over.
L527164	u7805	m528	BARNES	We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
L527163	u7814	m528	TED	Sir, about leaving --
L527162	u7805	m528	BARNES	How can he be missing?
L527157	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
L527156	u7814	m528	TED	Did you hear me, sir, because --
L527154	u7805	m528	BARNES	What?  No, I know they're civilians...
L527153	u7814	m528	TED	Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
L527083	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
L527082	u7805	m528	BARNES	But what does it do?  This... sphere.
L527052	u7814	m528	TED	Maybe we didn't want to come back.
L527051	u7805	m528	BARNES	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
L527050	u7814	m528	TED	Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
L527041	u7814	m528	TED	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
L527040	u7805	m528	BARNES	We had considered it.
L527013	u7805	m528	BARNES	What do you make of this?
L527012	u7814	m528	TED	What's wrong?
L526996	u7814	m528	TED	A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
L526995	u7805	m528	BARNES	Radiation shield, you think?
L526994	u7814	m528	TED	Some sort of lead or something.
L526993	u7805	m528	BARNES	What is it?
L526992	u7814	m528	TED	Look at this.
L526990	u7814	m528	TED	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
L526989	u7805	m528	BARNES	Ted, get her away from the door.
L526939	u7814	m528	TED	What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
L526938	u7805	m528	BARNES	What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
L526932	u7805	m528	BARNES	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
L526931	u7814	m528	TED	I'd also like it noted --
L526927	u7805	m528	BARNES	Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
L526926	u7814	m528	TED	Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
L526847	u7805	m528	BARNES	The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
L526846	u7814	m528	TED	A half a mile long?
L528072	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
L528071	u7806	m528	BETH	How's that?
L528070	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
L528069	u7806	m528	BETH	Would it work?
L527993	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away --
L527992	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527991	u7806	m528	BETH	Get away from me!
L527990	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hear what?
L527989	u7806	m528	BETH	You hear that?
L527988	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527987	u7806	m528	BETH	What is that?  What are you doing?
L527983	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
L527982	u7806	m528	BETH	Top shelf, is it?
L527981	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon --
L527980	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
L527979	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth -- gimme the gun.
L527978	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
L527977	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I --
L527976	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
L527975	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
L527974	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
L527972	u7806	m528	BETH	Leave me alone, Norman.
L527971	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth?
L527957	u7806	m528	BETH	It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
L527956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Stop it!
L527954	u7806	m528	BETH	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
L527953	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then where's it coming from?
L527952	u7806	m528	BETH	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
L527951	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, stop it!
L527950	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you know?
L527949	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where is it coming from, Beth?
L527948	u7806	m528	BETH	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
L527947	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth!
L527945	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
L527944	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't fuck with me, Beth.
L527943	u7806	m528	BETH	Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
L527938	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get away from the door, Beth.
L527937	u7806	m528	BETH	This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
L527932	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
L527931	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not safe for you to be either.
L527930	u7806	m528	BETH	It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
L527928	u7806	m528	BETH	It's either this... or I kill you.
L527927	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.  Please.
L527926	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
L527925	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527924	u7806	m528	BETH	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
L527923	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I promise --
L527922	u7806	m528	BETH	But I have to, Norman.
L527921	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't, Beth.
L527920	u7806	m528	BETH	It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything. Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
L527919	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
L527918	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
L527917	u7806	m528	BETH	"When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  ""I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?"
L527916	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up, Beth --
L527915	u7806	m528	BETH	"No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  ""Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming."" ""But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared."" ""C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.""  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?"
L527914	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry."
L527913	u7806	m528	BETH	Is it?
L527912	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's bullshit.
L527911	u7806	m528	BETH	"You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  ""Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"", he said."
L527910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yes.
L527909	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
L527908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I never went in that sphere.
L527907	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
L527906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're insane.
L527905	u7806	m528	BETH	Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
L527904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You manifested that, Beth.
L527903	u7806	m528	BETH	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
L527902	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's when you went in the sphere.
L527901	u7806	m528	BETH	And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
L527900	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But --
L527899	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
L527898	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're lying --
L527897	u7806	m528	BETH	C'mon -- what?
L527896	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
L527895	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
L527894	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Someone did.
L527893	u7806	m528	BETH	You think I manifested the snakes?
L527892	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
L527891	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he can't.
L527890	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He can't manifest.
L527889	u7806	m528	BETH	No, he isn't.
L527888	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
L527887	u7806	m528	BETH	Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
L527886	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
L527885	u7806	m528	BETH	"What's the phrase -- ""keeping up with the Joneses""?"
L527884	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you?
L527883	u7806	m528	BETH	If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
L527882	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you manifesting them?
L527881	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't you?
L527880	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Do you fear them?
L527879	u7806	m528	BETH	You tell me.
L527878	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
L527877	u7806	m528	BETH	Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
L527876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what I mean.
L527875	u7806	m528	BETH	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
L527874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do you feel about snakes?
L527873	u7806	m528	BETH	I did do that, didn't I?
L527872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
L527871	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
L527870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think I'd really drink that?
L527869	u7806	m528	BETH	It's getting cold.
L527868	u7806	m528	BETH	Are you?
L527867	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm feeling better.
L527866	u7806	m528	BETH	What's wrong, Norman?
L527862	u7806	m528	BETH	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
L527861	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Your watch.
L527860	u7806	m528	BETH	What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
L527840	u7806	m528	BETH	How's Harry?
L527839	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
L527838	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, different?
L527837	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The sphere looks different.
L527836	u7806	m528	BETH	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
L527835	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you?
L527834	u7806	m528	BETH	What is it, Norman?
L527829	u7806	m528	BETH	You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
L527828	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not believing you.
L527827	u7806	m528	BETH	For what?
L527826	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm sorry.
L527815	u7806	m528	BETH	Only lab rats.  Here.
L527814	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
L527813	u7806	m528	BETH	You ever given an injection before.
L527812	u7806	m528	BETH	Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
L527811	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want to kill him?
L527810	u7806	m528	BETH	To be on the safe side.  I mean --
L527809	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527808	u7806	m528	BETH	It's an idea.
L527806	u7806	m528	BETH	What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
L527805	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Doesn't say.
L527804	u7806	m528	BETH	How fast does it take effect?
L527803	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
L527802	u7806	m528	BETH	I'll just boost the doses.
L527801	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Three to six hours.
L527800	u7806	m528	BETH	How long does it last?
L527799	u7811	m528	NORMAN	20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... 
L527797	u7806	m528	BETH	... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... 
L527796	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's like a sleeping pill?
L527795	u7806	m528	BETH	Causes sleep.
L527794	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What's that?
L527793	u7806	m528	BETH	It's a soporific.
L527792	u7811	m528	NORMAN	P-a-r-a-s-o...
L527791	u7806	m528	BETH	How do you spell it?
L527790	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Parasolutrine?
L527789	u7806	m528	BETH	Antibiotic.
L527788	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
L527787	u7806	m528	BETH	Antihistamine.  For bites.
L527786	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Riordan?
L527785	u7806	m528	BETH	... and may also cause bizarre halucinations.
L527784	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Bingo.
L527783	u7806	m528	BETH	Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
L527782	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tarazine?
L527781	u7806	m528	BETH	Nothing about drowsiness.
L527780	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
L527779	u7806	m528	BETH	A synthetic opium analogue.
L527778	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Sintag.
L527777	u7806	m528	BETH	Ulcers.
L527776	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Valdomet.
L527775	u7806	m528	BETH	It's for motion sickness.
L527774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Ephedrine hydrochloride.
L527773	u7806	m528	BETH	Something for burns.
L527772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Diphenyl parlene.
L527744	u7806	m528	BETH	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
L527743	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Looks like some sort of code.
L527742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
L527741	u7806	m528	BETH	And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
L527740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
L527739	u7806	m528	BETH	His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
L527738	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
L527737	u7806	m528	BETH	But why is he doing it?
L527736	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
L527735	u7806	m528	BETH	Which I told Barnes was attacking --
L527734	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
L527733	u7806	m528	BETH	How can the sphere do that?
L527732	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L527731	u7806	m528	BETH	But how?
L527730	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
L527729	u7806	m528	BETH	You think, in the sphere --
L527728	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
L527727	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you mean, a part of Harry?
L527726	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say ""Harry"", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry."
L527724	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527723	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He translated it wrong.
L527722	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, ""Stop calling me Jerry"".  And --"
L527721	u7806	m528	BETH	Manifested?
L527720	u7811	m528	NORMAN	After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
L527717	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster.
L527716	u7806	m528	BETH	Squids?
L527715	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
L527714	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.  I could never read that far."""
L527713	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527712	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87.
L527709	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
L527708	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
L527707	u7806	m528	BETH	You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
L527706	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
L527705	u7806	m528	BETH	Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
L527704	u7811	m528	NORMAN	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
L527703	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't believe me.
L527702	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You think?
L527701	u7806	m528	BETH	No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
L527700	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
L527699	u7806	m528	BETH	None of this was here before.
L527698	u7811	m528	NORMAN	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
L527697	u7806	m528	BETH	Wait a second --
L527696	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We must've had it delivered then.
L527695	u7806	m528	BETH	That wasn't in there before.
L527694	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
L527693	u7806	m528	BETH	The refridgerator.
L527692	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The refridgerator.
L527691	u7806	m528	BETH	Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
L527690	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fixing it.
L527689	u7806	m528	BETH	What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
L527688	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
L527687	u7806	m528	BETH	You get it straightened out?
L527676	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He what?
L527675	u7806	m528	BETH	Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
L527674	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
L527673	u7806	m528	BETH	Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
L527672	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
L527671	u7806	m528	BETH	... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
L527649	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527648	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Still clear?
L527647	u7806	m528	BETH	You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
L527646	u7811	m528	NORMAN	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
L527645	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
L527644	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
L527643	u7806	m528	BETH	What's the matter?
L527642	u7806	m528	BETH	Still clear.
L527641	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
L527640	u7806	m528	BETH	The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
L527637	u7806	m528	BETH	You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
L527636	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But I don't know how --
L527635	u7806	m528	BETH	You don't trust me?
L527634	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You fixed my suit?
L527633	u7806	m528	BETH	I fixed your suit.
L527632	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I would.  But my suit --
L527631	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't trust Harry to do it.
L527630	u7811	m528	NORMAN	In case you die, too?
L527629	u7806	m528	BETH	You should know how it works.  Just in case.
L527628	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Why should I go?
L527627	u7806	m528	BETH	Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
L527626	u7806	m528	BETH	Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
L527625	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four days?
L527624	u7806	m528	BETH	We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
L527623	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
L527622	u7806	m528	BETH	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
L527621	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You, me and Harry?
L527620	u7806	m528	BETH	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
L527619	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's not worth the risk.
L527618	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't bother me, Norman.
L527617	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Forget the sub.
L527616	u7806	m528	BETH	I have to reset the sub.
L527615	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where are you going in such a hurry?
L527517	u7806	m528	BETH	No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
L527516	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527515	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
L527514	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
L527513	u7806	m528	BETH	You bastard.
L527512	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't do this.
L527511	u7806	m528	BETH	You did, didn't you?
L527510	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527509	u7806	m528	BETH	You told him about me?
L527508	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L527507	u7806	m528	BETH	You said something to him, didn't you?
L527506	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
L527505	u7806	m528	BETH	Don't tell me to calm down!
L527504	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
L527503	u7806	m528	BETH	He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
L527502	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You went through Edmunds' things?
L527501	u7806	m528	BETH	In Edmunds' things.
L527500	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where did you get this?
L527499	u7806	m528	BETH	Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.
L527498	u7806	m528	BETH	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
L527497	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
L527496	u7806	m528	BETH	So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
L527495	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527494	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
L527493	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
L527492	u7806	m528	BETH	... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
L527470	u7806	m528	BETH	Eggs.
L527469	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What are they?
L527468	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman.
L527462	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What could have done this?
L527461	u7806	m528	BETH	She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
L527460	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
L527320	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527319	u7806	m528	BETH	I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
L527318	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527317	u7806	m528	BETH	Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
L527316	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth.
L527315	u7806	m528	BETH	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
L527314	u7811	m528	NORMAN	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
L527313	u7806	m528	BETH	I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
L527312	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth --
L527311	u7806	m528	BETH	What?  Why...
L527310	u7811	m528	NORMAN	And you didn't tell anyone?
L527309	u7806	m528	BETH	Yeah, why?
L527308	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
L527307	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527306	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a minute.
L527305	u7806	m528	BETH	They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
L527304	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean -- not normal?
L527303	u7806	m528	BETH	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
L527302	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
L527301	u7806	m528	BETH	What about you?  What happened to you?
L527300	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah, it was awful.
L527299	u7806	m528	BETH	My gosh, Norman.
L527298	u7811	m528	NORMAN	... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
L527297	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
L527296	u7806	m528	BETH	A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
L527295	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We have a library?
L527294	u7806	m528	BETH	The library.
L527293	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where'd this come from?
L527119	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
L527118	u7806	m528	BETH	It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
L527058	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get this thing off me.
L527057	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman!
L527028	u7806	m528	BETH	Good theory, Ted.
L527027	u7811	m528	NORMAN	400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
L526957	u7806	m528	BETH	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
L526956	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
L526955	u7806	m528	BETH	You're next, Norman.
L526954	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Yeah.  Drowning.
L526953	u7806	m528	BETH	Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
L526876	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What -- are you threatening me?
L526875	u7806	m528	BETH	Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
L526874	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The timing has never seemed quite right.
L526873	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
L526872	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It never occurred to me.
L526871	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
L526870	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
L526869	u7806	m528	BETH	What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
L526868	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Underwater?
L526867	u7806	m528	BETH	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
L526866	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait -- down where?
L526865	u7806	m528	BETH	Because when we get down there --
L526864	u7811	m528	NORMAN	C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
L526863	u7806	m528	BETH	Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
L526862	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
L526861	u7806	m528	BETH	That's quite a secret.
L526860	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
L526859	u7806	m528	BETH	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
L526858	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
L526857	u7806	m528	BETH	I love secrets.
L526856	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
L527406	u7806	m528	BETH	Who says it's a he?
L527405	u7814	m528	TED	He doesn't wait for an answer.
L527195	u7814	m528	TED	By the bunks.
L527194	u7806	m528	BETH	Norman?  Where's Norman?
L527030	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
L527029	u7814	m528	TED	Well, what's your theory?
L527018	u7814	m528	TED	It doesn't make any sense.
L527017	u7806	m528	BETH	I don't get it.
L527002	u7814	m528	TED	Well, they're not mine.
L527001	u7806	m528	BETH	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
L527000	u7814	m528	TED	No.  I don't think so.
L526900	u7806	m528	BETH	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
L526899	u7814	m528	TED	Pussy.
L528063	u7809	m528	HARRY	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
L528062	u7806	m528	BETH	We can refuse to talk.
L528061	u7809	m528	HARRY	They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
L527766	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yes you are...
L527765	u7806	m528	BETH	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
L527764	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're staring at me.
L527763	u7806	m528	BETH	Like what?  I'm not --
L527762	u7809	m528	HARRY	Why are you looking at me like that?
L527761	u7809	m528	HARRY	Another attack?
L527760	u7806	m528	BETH	Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
L527759	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just in time for what?
L527758	u7806	m528	BETH	What?
L527757	u7809	m528	HARRY	In time for what?
L527756	u7806	m528	BETH	Just in time, too.
L527749	u7809	m528	HARRY	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
L527748	u7806	m528	BETH	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
L527747	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
L527746	u7806	m528	BETH	Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
L527681	u7806	m528	BETH	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
L527680	u7809	m528	HARRY	We never even had a conversation, Norman.
L527679	u7806	m528	BETH	Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
L527678	u7809	m528	HARRY	I never said that.
L527677	u7806	m528	BETH	When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
L527103	u7809	m528	HARRY	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
L527102	u7806	m528	BETH	Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
L527054	u7809	m528	HARRY	A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
L527053	u7806	m528	BETH	What are you looking for?
L527037	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's an American spacecraft.
L527036	u7806	m528	BETH	Then what is it?
L527005	u7809	m528	HARRY	You'd have to ask them.
L527004	u7806	m528	BETH	It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
L526943	u7806	m528	BETH	For whoever's in that thing.
L526942	u7809	m528	HARRY	For who?  The fish?
L526941	u7806	m528	BETH	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
L526940	u7809	m528	HARRY	Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
L527263	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
L527262	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Is it coming from our own computer?
L527261	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
L527260	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Where's it coming from?
L527259	u7807	m528	EDMUNDS	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
L527258	u7811	m528	NORMAN	When did it come across?
L528068	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
L528067	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean forget?
L528066	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
L528065	u7809	m528	HARRY	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
L528064	u7811	m528	NORMAN	There is one possibility.
L528055	u7809	m528	HARRY	No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
L528054	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
L528053	u7809	m528	HARRY	How's that working out, by the way?
L528049	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
L528048	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Nine hundred feet to surface.
L528047	u7809	m528	HARRY	Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
L528043	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait!
L528042	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, press something!
L528041	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No idea.
L528040	u7809	m528	HARRY	You know how to work this thing?
L528038	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm trying.  There.
L528037	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
L528036	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You got her?
L528035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her legs are in the way.
L528034	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
L528033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme a second --
L528032	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying to keep balance with --
L528031	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman!
L528024	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and catch.
L528023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
L528022	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I heard!  I heard!
L528021	u7809	m528	HARRY	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
L528020	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528018	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
L528017	u7809	m528	HARRY	Missed.
L528016	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
L528015	u7809	m528	HARRY	Push her, c'mon.
L528014	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Hold on.
L528013	u7809	m528	HARRY	I can't reach her.
L528007	u7809	m528	HARRY	How far away's the sub?
L528006	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
L528005	u7809	m528	HARRY	How much time you figure to get to the surface?
L528004	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Shut up and open the door.
L528003	u7809	m528	HARRY	We're never gonna make it.
L528002	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Help me lift her.
L528001	u7809	m528	HARRY	Fine.
L527996	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
L527995	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't think so.
L527994	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I kill her?
L527823	u7809	m528	HARRY	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
L527822	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's the squid!  Stop it!
L527821	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You know what it is, Harry.
L527820	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is it?
L527771	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
L527770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That's right.
L527769	u7809	m528	HARRY	The three of us.
L527768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
L527754	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
L527753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How do we decode it?
L527752	u7809	m528	HARRY	Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
L527751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wisconsin?
L527750	u7809	m528	HARRY	Wisconsin's your answer.
L527686	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
L527685	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But why would she -- ?
L527684	u7809	m528	HARRY	I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
L527683	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You didn't say that about the food?
L527682	u7809	m528	HARRY	She's cracking, Norman.
L527670	u7809	m528	HARRY	I thought she was with you.
L527669	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth left?
L527668	u7809	m528	HARRY	Her suit's gone.
L527667	u7811	m528	NORMAN	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
L527666	u7809	m528	HARRY	When I woke up, nobody was here.
L527665	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What do you mean?  She's not here?
L527664	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happened to her?
L527663	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
L527661	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
L527660	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
L527659	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman, where are you?
L527658	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry?
L527657	u7809	m528	HARRY	... you there?  Norman?
L527271	u7809	m528	HARRY	I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
L527270	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You don't remember that?
L527269	u7809	m528	HARRY	Did I?
L527268	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
L527267	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
L527266	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
L527265	u7809	m528	HARRY	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
L527264	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Getting anywhere with those?
L527255	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are they?
L527254	u7811	m528	NORMAN	These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
L527243	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That far in what, Harry?
L527242	u7809	m528	HARRY	I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
L527241	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Page 87 of what, Harry?
L527240	u7809	m528	HARRY	What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
L527239	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What is it, Harry?
L527238	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman?
L527237	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Then explain it to me.
L527236	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't understand about the sphere.
L527235	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
L527234	u7809	m528	HARRY	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
L527233	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You remember opening the door?
L527232	u7809	m528	HARRY	What are you still doing here?
L527231	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
L527230	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's like...
L527229	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What noise?
L527228	u7809	m528	HARRY	What is that?  That noise?
L527141	u7809	m528	HARRY	Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
L527140	u7811	m528	NORMAN	It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
L527139	u7809	m528	HARRY	Then what, Norman?
L527138	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No.  I didn't say that.
L527137	u7809	m528	HARRY	You mean, you think I'm cracking?
L527136	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
L527135	u7809	m528	HARRY	Am I?
L527134	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
L527133	u7809	m528	HARRY	Gimme another explanation.
L527132	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I can't believe that, Harry.
L527131	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
L527130	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
L527129	u7809	m528	HARRY	So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
L527128	u7811	m528	NORMAN	So what?
L527127	u7809	m528	HARRY	"On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible."
L527126	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't follow you.
L527125	u7809	m528	HARRY	A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
L527124	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Not a clue.
L527123	u7809	m528	HARRY	I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
L527122	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
L527112	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
L527111	u7809	m528	HARRY	And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
L527099	u7809	m528	HARRY	Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
L527098	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
L527081	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our present.
L527080	u7811	m528	NORMAN	But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
L527079	u7809	m528	HARRY	This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
L527078	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
L527077	u7809	m528	HARRY	This answers one of our questions.
L527070	u7809	m528	HARRY	Time travel.  A black hole.
L527069	u7811	m528	NORMAN	To what?
L527068	u7809	m528	HARRY	Our answer.
L527061	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Whatever I can do to help.
L527060	u7809	m528	HARRY	Nice work, Norman.
L526964	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Look, would you --
L526963	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon, Norman.
L526961	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Wait a second, I --
L526960	u7809	m528	HARRY	C'mon.
L526959	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, why don't --
L526958	u7809	m528	HARRY	Go ahead.  Ladies first.
L526910	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm fine.
L526909	u7809	m528	HARRY	You sound defensive.
L526908	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not being defensive.
L526907	u7809	m528	HARRY	Don't be defensive.
L526906	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Fine.  I'm fine.
L526905	u7809	m528	HARRY	You holding up alright?
L526904	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526903	u7809	m528	HARRY	How are you feeling, Norman?
L527445	u7809	m528	HARRY	"It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming ""witchcraft"".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics."
L527444	u7814	m528	TED	Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
L527394	u7814	m528	TED	Thank you.
L527393	u7809	m528	HARRY	Good idea, Ted.
L527388	u7809	m528	HARRY	We are friends.
L527387	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say?
L527370	u7809	m528	HARRY	Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
L527369	u7814	m528	TED	See?  No code.  What'd I say?
L527368	u7809	m528	HARRY	... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
L527351	u7814	m528	TED	Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
L527350	u7809	m528	HARRY	If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
L527347	u7814	m528	TED	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
L527346	u7809	m528	HARRY	Well, if it's a discharge --
L527253	u7814	m528	TED	Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
L527252	u7809	m528	HARRY	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
L527251	u7814	m528	TED	Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
L527085	u7809	m528	HARRY	Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
L527084	u7814	m528	TED	Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
L527049	u7809	m528	HARRY	Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
L527048	u7814	m528	TED	Arrived?  From where?
L527047	u7809	m528	HARRY	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
L527046	u7814	m528	TED	Please.  It must have flown here --
L527045	u7809	m528	HARRY	Meaning it didn't land in the water.
L527044	u7814	m528	TED	Meaning?
L527043	u7809	m528	HARRY	We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
L527039	u7809	m528	HARRY	It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
L527038	u7814	m528	TED	An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
L527035	u7809	m528	HARRY	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
L527034	u7814	m528	TED	If it is an alien spacecraft --
L527033	u7809	m528	HARRY	Do you?
L527032	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
L527031	u7809	m528	HARRY	All the facts you need are right in front of you.
L527026	u7814	m528	TED	Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
L527025	u7809	m528	HARRY	Think about it.
L527024	u7814	m528	TED	Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
L527023	u7809	m528	HARRY	Is it?
L527022	u7814	m528	TED	But it's impossible.
L527021	u7809	m528	HARRY	A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
L527020	u7814	m528	TED	Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
L527019	u7809	m528	HARRY	You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
L527016	u7809	m528	HARRY	That's right.
L527015	u7814	m528	TED	English?
L526971	u7809	m528	HARRY	Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
L526970	u7814	m528	TED	Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
L526968	u7814	m528	TED	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
L526967	u7809	m528	HARRY	Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
L526952	u7809	m528	HARRY	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
L526951	u7814	m528	TED	It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
L526917	u7809	m528	HARRY	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
L526916	u7814	m528	TED	What is it, Harry?
L526915	u7809	m528	HARRY	She told me what you said, Norman.
L526914	u7809	m528	HARRY	Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
L526913	u7814	m528	TED	What does Norman already know?
L526912	u7809	m528	HARRY	To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
L526911	u7814	m528	TED	What'd you say to him?
L527608	u7811	m528	NORMAN	About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
L527607	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	What was that, sir?
L527606	u7811	m528	NORMAN	That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
L527605	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
L527604	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Beth and Harry?
L527603	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	The others, sir?
L527602	u7811	m528	NORMAN	How are the others?
L527601	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
L527600	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The ships?
L527599	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
L527598	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Does this mean what I think it means?
L527597	u7810	m528	NAVY SEAMAN	Norman Johnson.
L526783	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Told me what?
L526782	u7812	m528	OFFICER	You mean they haven't told you yet?
L526781	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526780	u7812	m528	OFFICER	By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
L526779	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Really?
L526778	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
L526777	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Captain who?
L526776	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
L526775	u7812	m528	OFFICER	This way, sir.
L526774	u7811	m528	NORMAN	No, they didn't say --
L526773	u7812	m528	OFFICER	No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
L526772	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
L526771	u7812	m528	OFFICER	Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
L526770	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
L526769	u7813	m528	PILOT	Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
L526768	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Geologists?  At a plane crash?
L526767	u7813	m528	PILOT	Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
L526766	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Who's everyone?
L526765	u7813	m528	PILOT	Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
L526764	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Know what?
L526763	u7813	m528	PILOT	You mean you don't know?
L526762	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526761	u7813	m528	PILOT	Huh?
L526760	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What report?
L526759	u7813	m528	PILOT	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
L526758	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You've heard of me?
L526757	u7813	m528	PILOT	Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
L526756	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
L527522	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
L527521	u7814	m528	TED	Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
L527479	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I'm not sure.
L527478	u7814	m528	TED	You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
L527475	u7814	m528	TED	Not that I know of.  Why?
L527474	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
L527473	u7814	m528	TED	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
L527472	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What was it?
L527449	u7814	m528	TED	Why's that?
L527448	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
L527424	u7811	m528	NORMAN	"When he uses a phrase like ""I am Happy"", I think we should think twice about what we ask him."
L527423	u7814	m528	TED	You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
L527402	u7814	m528	TED	Unless it's an act.
L527401	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, he's polite.
L527367	u7814	m528	TED	"Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that ""someone went to a lot of trouble, try again"" bullshit.  And ""impotent"".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick."
L527366	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
L527365	u7814	m528	TED	Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
L527364	u7811	m528	NORMAN	The creature?
L527363	u7814	m528	TED	Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
L527362	u7811	m528	NORMAN	This is like nursery school.
L527361	u7814	m528	TED	Try this one.
L527360	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Please, Ted.
L527359	u7814	m528	TED	Squint harder.
L527358	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't see anything.
L527357	u7814	m528	TED	Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
L527356	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You mean a picture?
L527355	u7814	m528	TED	It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
L527354	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Like what?
L527353	u7814	m528	TED	He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
L527011	u7814	m528	TED	Still, make a note I recognized that.
L527010	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
L527009	u7814	m528	TED	Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
L526973	u7814	m528	TED	You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
L526972	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You want me to try?
L526902	u7814	m528	TED	He's a pussy.
L526901	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He wasn't feeling well.
L526754	u7815	m528	WIFE	They never used to send a Navy car.
L526753	u7811	m528	NORMAN	I don't know.
L526752	u7815	m528	WIFE	Was it a military crash?
L526751	u7811	m528	NORMAN	What?
L526750	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
L526749	u7815	m528	WIFE	How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
L526748	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
L526747	u7815	m528	WIFE	Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
L526746	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Four.  Four years --
L526745	u7815	m528	WIFE	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
L526744	u7811	m528	NORMAN	Don't be so supportive, honey.
L526743	u7815	m528	WIFE	In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
L526742	u7811	m528	NORMAN	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
L526741	u7815	m528	WIFE	There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
L526740	u7811	m528	NORMAN	You seen my suitcase?
L526739	u7815	m528	WIFE	What kind of a crash was it?
L542275	u7816	m529	BEN	May the Force be with you.
L542274	u7821	m529	HAN	We'll be back before you are, old man.
L542273	u7816	m529	BEN	That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
L542257	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not going out there.
L542256	u7816	m529	BEN	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
L542255	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
L542251	u7816	m529	BEN	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
L542250	u7821	m529	HAN	Is that good or bad?
L542249	u7816	m529	BEN	Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
L542224	u7821	m529	HAN	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
L542223	u7816	m529	BEN	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
L542222	u7821	m529	HAN	I'll get the information.
L542221	u7816	m529	BEN	All right then, we'll use your plan.
L542220	u7821	m529	HAN	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
L542219	u7816	m529	BEN	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
L542218	u7821	m529	HAN	We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
L542206	u7821	m529	HAN	Not bad.
L542205	u7816	m529	BEN	You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
L542202	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not afraid of anything...
L542201	u7816	m529	BEN	Fear is their greatest weapon.
L542200	u7821	m529	HAN	Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
L542198	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't a game, you know.
L542197	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
L542186	u7821	m529	HAN	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
L542185	u7816	m529	BEN	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
L542184	u7821	m529	HAN	How much do you think she's talking about?
L542183	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm beginning not to like you.
L542182	u7816	m529	BEN	I think there are some things we should talk about.
L542181	u7821	m529	HAN	Who's going to pay me then?
L542180	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
L542177	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
L542176	u7816	m529	BEN	No, not anymore.
L542175	u7821	m529	HAN	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
L542174	u7816	m529	BEN	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
L542173	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
L542172	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
L542171	u7821	m529	HAN	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
L542170	u7816	m529	BEN	The Empire must have gotten here first.
L542162	u7821	m529	HAN	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
L542161	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, we'll see...
L542090	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
L542089	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
L542433	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
L542432	u7824	m529	LUKE	The Kiber Crystal.
L542254	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm not going alone!
L542253	u7816	m529	BEN	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
L542252	u7824	m529	LUKE	What about the princess?
L542216	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
L542215	u7816	m529	BEN	See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
L542214	u7816	m529	BEN	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
L542213	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
L542212	u7816	m529	BEN	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
L542211	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't see!  How can I fight?
L542192	u7816	m529	BEN	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
L542191	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean we should go after her!...
L542190	u7816	m529	BEN	But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
L542165	u7824	m529	LUKE	He can't find Organa Major.
L542164	u7816	m529	BEN	What is it?
L542157	u7816	m529	BEN	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
L542156	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do I do?
L542155	u7816	m529	BEN	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
L542154	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you sure you don't need it?
L542142	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
L542141	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you all right?
L542140	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
L542139	u7824	m529	LUKE	What's wrong?  What's happening?
L542138	u7816	m529	BEN	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
L542137	u7824	m529	LUKE	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
L542136	u7816	m529	BEN	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
L542135	u7824	m529	LUKE	When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
L542117	u7816	m529	BEN	He's bluffing...
L542116	u7824	m529	LUKE	This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
L542094	u7816	m529	BEN	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
L542093	u7824	m529	LUKE	We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
L542061	u7816	m529	BEN	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
L542060	u7824	m529	LUKE	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
L542059	u7816	m529	BEN	They use the Bogan Force.
L542058	u7824	m529	LUKE	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
L542057	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
L542056	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's where my father was killed.
L542055	u7816	m529	BEN	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
L542054	u7824	m529	LUKE	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
L542053	u7816	m529	BEN	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
L542052	u7824	m529	LUKE	How can you store an energy field within you?
L542051	u7816	m529	BEN	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
L542050	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
L542049	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
L542047	u7816	m529	BEN	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
L542046	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean?
L542045	u7816	m529	BEN	That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
L542044	u7824	m529	LUKE	Could I learn to feel it?
L542043	u7816	m529	BEN	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
L542042	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean I generate an energy field?
L542041	u7816	m529	BEN	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
L542040	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
L542039	u7816	m529	BEN	You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
L542034	u7816	m529	BEN	Not any more!
L542033	u7824	m529	LUKE	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
L542032	u7816	m529	BEN	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
L542031	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
L542030	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
L542028	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
L542027	u7816	m529	BEN	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
L542026	u7824	m529	LUKE	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
L542025	u7816	m529	BEN	You could put it that way.
L542024	u7824	m529	LUKE	You saw through me?
L542023	u7816	m529	BEN	I know that.
L542022	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
L542021	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
L542020	u7816	m529	BEN	I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
L542019	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
L542018	u7816	m529	BEN	I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
L542016	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
L542015	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
L542014	u7816	m529	BEN	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
L542013	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who are you anyway?
L542009	u7824	m529	LUKE	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
L542008	u7816	m529	BEN	Oh, so you're a warrior then?
L542007	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
L542000	u7816	m529	BEN	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
L541999	u7824	m529	LUKE	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
L541998	u7816	m529	BEN	Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
L541996	u7816	m529	BEN	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
L541995	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
L541994	u7816	m529	BEN	Good morning!
L541933	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
L541932	u7824	m529	LUKE	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
L541931	u7817	m529	BIGGS	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
L541930	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
L541929	u7817	m529	BIGGS	I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
L541910	u7824	m529	LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
L541909	u7817	m529	BIGGS	That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
L541905	u7824	m529	LUKE	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
L541904	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Of course, where you been kid?
L542494	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Forget it, son.
L542493	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir, but I can get him...
L542492	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
L542491	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	What's that?
L542490	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
L542464	u7824	m529	LUKE	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
L542463	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
L542452	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542451	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
L542450	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
L542449	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Have you been checked out?
L542448	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542447	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	You're Starkiller?
L542233	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
L542232	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
L542230	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Send one squad up.
L542229	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
L542228	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	I'll make a report later.
L542227	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
L542226	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
L542225	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
L542421	u7823	m529	LEIA	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
L542420	u7821	m529	HAN	What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
L542413	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
L542412	u7823	m529	LEIA	We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
L542411	u7823	m529	LEIA	Did it occur to you they might find us?
L542410	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
L542401	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd better go see how he's doing.
L542400	u7823	m529	LEIA	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
L542399	u7821	m529	HAN	Where are you taking us now anyway?
L542398	u7823	m529	LEIA	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
L542397	u7823	m529	LEIA	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
L542396	u7821	m529	HAN	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
L542395	u7823	m529	LEIA	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
L542394	u7821	m529	HAN	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
L542393	u7823	m529	LEIA	All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
L542389	u7821	m529	HAN	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
L542388	u7823	m529	LEIA	There are only three or four left.
L542386	u7821	m529	HAN	Was this trip really necessary?
L542385	u7823	m529	LEIA	Here come six more... grid two!
L542363	u7823	m529	LEIA	It could be worse...
L542362	u7821	m529	HAN	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
L542361	u7823	m529	LEIA	Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
L542511	u7824	m529	LUKE	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
L542510	u7821	m529	HAN	I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
L542429	u7821	m529	HAN	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
L542428	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
L542408	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
L542407	u7824	m529	LUKE	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
L542406	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
L542349	u7824	m529	LUKE	Come back here... Where are you going?
L542348	u7821	m529	HAN	Get to the ship!
L542328	u7821	m529	HAN	Move out of the way!
L542327	u7824	m529	LUKE	It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
L542323	u7824	m529	LUKE	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
L542322	u7821	m529	HAN	Watch it!  Move back.
L542320	u7821	m529	HAN	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
L542319	u7824	m529	LUKE	Is he afraid of the water?
L542314	u7821	m529	HAN	Not if this tunnel deadends.
L542313	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think she's going to be all right.
L542308	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
L542307	u7821	m529	HAN	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
L542306	u7824	m529	LUKE	Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
L542282	u7821	m529	HAN	I think I did.
L542281	u7824	m529	LUKE	Why didn't you say so before.
L542280	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't going to work.
L542268	u7821	m529	HAN	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
L542267	u7824	m529	LUKE	Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
L542209	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
L542208	u7821	m529	HAN	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
L542207	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I practice a lot...
L542196	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't you believe it.
L542195	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
L542194	u7821	m529	HAN	No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
L542188	u7821	m529	HAN	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
L542187	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
L542179	u7821	m529	HAN	Why?
L542178	u7824	m529	LUKE	You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
L542167	u7824	m529	LUKE	What are you saying?
L542166	u7821	m529	HAN	I found it... It's just not there.
L542160	u7821	m529	HAN	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
L542159	u7824	m529	LUKE	You don't believe in the Force?
L542158	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
L542151	u7821	m529	HAN	It's automatic.
L542150	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who's the pilot?
L542097	u7824	m529	LUKE	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
L542096	u7821	m529	HAN	You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
L542092	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
L542091	u7821	m529	HAN	Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
L542292	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating...
L542291	u7824	m529	LUKE	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
L542290	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	With four casualties?!
L542289	u7824	m529	LUKE	No need, everything's under control.
L542288	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	We'll send a squad up.
L542287	u7824	m529	LUKE	A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
L542148	u7827	m529	VADER	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
L542147	u7823	m529	LEIA	No!...
L542146	u7827	m529	VADER	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
L542145	u7823	m529	LEIA	They'll find its weakness.
L542144	u7827	m529	VADER	The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
L541922	u7827	m529	VADER	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
L541921	u7823	m529	LEIA	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
L541920	u7827	m529	VADER	Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
L542426	u7823	m529	LEIA	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
L542425	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
L542424	u7823	m529	LEIA	And you?
L542405	u7823	m529	LEIA	He'll be well cared for.
L542404	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
L542333	u7823	m529	LEIA	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
L542332	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
L542317	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
L542316	u7823	m529	LEIA	What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
L541955	u7825	m529	OWEN	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
L541954	u7824	m529	LUKE	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
L541953	u7825	m529	OWEN	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
L541952	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
L541951	u7825	m529	OWEN	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
L541950	u7824	m529	LUKE	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
L541949	u7825	m529	OWEN	First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
L542438	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'd consider it an honor.
L542437	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
L542369	u7824	m529	LUKE	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
L542368	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Are you there, sir?  We're going...
L542367	u7824	m529	LUKE	Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
L542352	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
L542351	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
L542346	u7824	m529	LUKE	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
L542345	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
L542344	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you safe?
L542343	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
L542342	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
L542341	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I read you sir.
L542340	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio... do you copy?
L542272	u7824	m529	LUKE	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
L542271	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
L542153	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
L542152	u7824	m529	LUKE	Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
L542113	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
L542112	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
L542111	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
L542005	u7824	m529	LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
L542004	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
L542003	u7824	m529	LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
L542002	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
L541988	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
L541987	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
L541986	u7824	m529	LUKE	According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
L541969	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
L541968	u7824	m529	LUKE	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
L541967	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
L541966	u7824	m529	LUKE	You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
L541965	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
L541964	u7824	m529	LUKE	There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
L541963	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
L541962	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
L541961	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
L541960	u7824	m529	LUKE	Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
L544518	u7828	m530	ACE	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
L544517	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Saddle up, Roughnecks !
L544456	u7828	m530	ACE	Yes, sir !
L544455	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
L544408	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
L544407	u7828	m530	ACE	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
L544406	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
L544405	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're the old men, Ace.
L544404	u7828	m530	ACE	We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
L544323	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Not enough, I guess.
L544322	u7828	m530	ACE	Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
L544205	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What about it, Diz ?
L544204	u7828	m530	ACE	No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
L544167	u7828	m530	ACE	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
L544166	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was our teacher... He was great.
L544165	u7828	m530	ACE	Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
L544113	u7828	m530	ACE	I didn't see him !
L544112	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
L544085	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Death to all bugs !
L544084	u7828	m530	ACE	Mobile Infantery rules !
L544082	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	YAAAAAAAA !
L544081	u7828	m530	ACE	No, this hurts.
L544051	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What do I want with a scar ?
L544050	u7828	m530	ACE	I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
L543907	u7828	m530	ACE	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
L543906	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
L543905	u7828	m530	ACE	Whad'ya talkin  about ?
L543904	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's what I deserve.
L543903	u7828	m530	ACE	Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
L543842	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
L543841	u7828	m530	ACE	Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
L543824	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, maybe you better look again.
L543823	u7828	m530	ACE	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
L543822	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
L543812	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
L543811	u7828	m530	ACE	You rich kids... are all the same !
L543810	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Something... I've got...you don't.
L543809	u7828	m530	ACE	What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
L543801	u7828	m530	ACE	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
L543800	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What an honor...
L543799	u7828	m530	ACE	You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
L544019	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
L544018	u7829	m530	C.O.	Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
L544017	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
L543934	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir... I guess I do, sir.
L543933	u7829	m530	C.O.	Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
L543930	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
L543929	u7829	m530	C.O.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
L543928	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, no, sir.
L543927	u7829	m530	C.O.	Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
L543926	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
L543925	u7829	m530	C.O.	Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
L544506	u7830	m530	CARL	I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
L544505	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You always told me you couldn't do human...
L544393	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
L544392	u7830	m530	CARL	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
L544391	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
L544390	u7830	m530	CARL	Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
L544389	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
L544388	u7830	m530	CARL	You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
L544385	u7830	m530	CARL	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
L544384	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
L544383	u7830	m530	CARL	Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
L544378	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
L544377	u7830	m530	CARL	Please continue, Sergeant.
L543706	u7830	m530	CARL	I got Games & Theory.
L543705	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't believe it !
L543558	u7830	m530	CARL	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
L543557	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
L543556	u7830	m530	CARL	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
L543555	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Eight point... no, uh, seven...
L543554	u7830	m530	CARL	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
L543553	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
L543552	u7830	m530	CARL	Your father will never let you.
L543551	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
L543550	u7830	m530	CARL	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
L543549	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
L543545	u7830	m530	CARL	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
L543544	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How do you make him do that ?
L543538	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	"In addition to ""psychic dolt"" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts."
L543537	u7830	m530	CARL	Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
L543536	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Ace of spades.
L543535	u7830	m530	CARL	Don't think about it... go on instinct.
L543499	u7830	m530	CARL	You got it bad.
L543498	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, but I want Carmen.
L543497	u7830	m530	CARL	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
L543496	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Did you read her mind ?
L543495	u7830	m530	CARL	Others are waiting.
L543494	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's the hurry ?
L543493	u7830	m530	CARL	You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
L544492	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, no...!
L544491	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
L544490	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, what are you doing ?
L544479	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Is it true ?
L544478	u7843	m530	ZANDER	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
L544477	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
L544374	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I do.
L544373	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I don't know, Zander.
L544372	u7843	m530	ZANDER	How do you feel about him now ?
L544371	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yeah.
L544370	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
L544369	u7831	m530	CARMEN	A funeral.
L544368	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Where are you going ?
L544162	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You're upset, that's alright.
L544161	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
L544160	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
L544159	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm sorry, Carmen.
L544158	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Excuse me...!
L544157	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Carmen...?
L544155	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
L544154	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
L544153	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
L544152	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Funny...
L544151	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
L544150	u7831	m530	CARMEN	So who's got time to get married ?
L544149	u7843	m530	ZANDER	So ?
L544148	u7831	m530	CARMEN	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
L544147	u7843	m530	ZANDER	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
L544146	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
L544145	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
L544074	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, please... Let's go !
L544073	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
L544069	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
L544068	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, wait...
L544065	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
L544064	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
L543967	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It looks like an... asteroid.
L543965	u7831	m530	CARMEN	WHERE IS IT ?
L543962	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
L543961	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
L543958	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You and me, huh ?
L543957	u7843	m530	ZANDER	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
L543956	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
L543955	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Well, whad'ya know...
L543954	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
L543953	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
L543952	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey, check it.
L543951	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
L543950	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
L543949	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Profile's wrong... there.
L543948	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
L543947	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
L543868	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Oh, I see... teamwork.
L543867	u7843	m530	ZANDER	They revoke our flight status.
L543866	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Or...?
L543865	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
L543864	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
L543863	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
L543862	u7831	m530	CARMEN	In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
L543859	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
L543858	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
L543856	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Only when I give you an order.
L543855	u7831	m530	CARMEN	"Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you ""sir"" ?"
L543854	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
L543853	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey ! What are you doing here ?
L543642	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
L543641	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, this is Zander.
L543574	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't you have to finish the game ?
L543573	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm all ears.
L543571	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
L543570	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
L543569	u7843	m530	ZANDER	So what are you doing later ?
L543568	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm getting better.
L543567	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Are you alright ?
L544482	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
L544481	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Which way ?
L544433	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We've gotta go get her !
L544432	u7831	m530	CARMEN	AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
L544397	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	See you on the bounce !
L544396	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Take care, wilya Johnny ?
L544382	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How are you, Carl ?
L544381	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
L544367	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I like it. It's kinda...you.
L544366	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
L544365	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What happened to your eye ?
L544364	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
L544363	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	That was just a mix up.
L544362	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
L544361	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
L544360	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
L544359	u7831	m530	CARMEN	...I'm sorry.
L544355	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
L544354	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
L544078	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
L544077	u7831	m530	CARMEN	What's wrong with you ?
L544063	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
L544062	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Should I be ?
L544061	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You don't look very happy to see me.
L544060	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
L544059	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
L544058	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
L544057	u7831	m530	CARMEN	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
L544056	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What happened to your hair ?
L543899	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
L543898	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Shhhh...!
L543744	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
L543743	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Do you mean it ?
L543742	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Alright, I love you.
L543741	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
L543738	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I love you.
L543737	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
L543736	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna miss you.
L543734	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
L543733	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You talk to Carl ?
L543732	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
L543731	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
L543729	u7831	m530	CARMEN	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
L543728	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're late.
L543713	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'll go for that.
L543712	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
L543708	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
L543707	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
L543703	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Did you get Starside R&D ?
L543702	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
L543698	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
L543697	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
L543696	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
L543695	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
L543664	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Shhh...
L543663	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I love you, Carmen.
L543661	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You're right. Let's never stop...
L543660	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares ?
L543659	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
L543657	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
L543656	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Are you the boy for me ?
L543655	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't even know if you're my girl.
L543654	u7831	m530	CARMEN	He's nothing like you.
L543653	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I can't help it.
L543652	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
L543651	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You two have so much in common.
L543650	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander is going for pilot, too.
L543649	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
L543648	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
L543647	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, sure, I guess.
L543646	u7831	m530	CARMEN	He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
L543644	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Good luck at the academy.
L543643	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	None at all... We won.
L543632	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'll meet you outside.
L543631	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
L543630	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
L543629	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
L543627	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
L543626	u7831	m530	CARMEN	How do I know if this is love ?
L543625	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Isn't it great to be in love ?
L543534	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
L543533	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
L543532	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
L543531	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
L543530	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
L543529	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Carl can wait.
L543528	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought you were going to help Carl.
L543527	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Why not ?
L543526	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You can't walk me home.
L543525	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's all I think about anymore.
L543524	u7831	m530	CARMEN	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
L543523	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
L543522	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I don't want everyone to see.
L543521	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
L543520	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
L543519	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
L543518	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
L543517	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
L543516	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Excuse me...!
L543515	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
L543508	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
L543507	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Eeuch !
L543504	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I have good reflexes.
L543503	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
L543502	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who ?
L543501	u7831	m530	CARMEN	She's flying starships !
L543491	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Your turn...
L543490	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Good for you.
L544424	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No way, ma'am !
L544423	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
L544421	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Ibanez...LET'S GO !
L544420	u7831	m530	CARMEN	This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
L544399	u7832	m530	DELADIER	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
L544398	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
L544101	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
L544100	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
L543977	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Thank you, ma'am.
L543976	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
L543861	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yes, ma'am.
L543860	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
L543852	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yes, ma'am !
L543851	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
L543850	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
L544106	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That's it, we're empty ma'am !
L544105	u7832	m530	DELADIER	This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
L543972	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
L543971	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
L543970	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Where'd it come from ?
L543964	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
L543963	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Report.
L543870	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
L543869	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
L544350	u7833	m530	DIZZY	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
L544349	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
L544348	u7833	m530	DIZZY	I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
L544313	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
L544312	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All bands.
L544311	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What frequency ?
L544282	u7833	m530	DIZZY	I'm on it !
L544281	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Diz, see what you can do.
L544263	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
L544262	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
L544246	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What ?
L544245	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, Diz...
L544240	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Well, excuse me, sir...
L544239	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
L544238	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You used to dance...
L544237	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Nah, I don't do that anymore...
L544236	u7833	m530	DIZZY	C'mon...
L544203	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna need a squad leader.
L544202	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Way to go, amigo !
L544001	u7833	m530	DIZZY	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
L544000	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's that, Diz ?
L543999	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
L543998	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, see ya.
L543981	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
L543980	u7833	m530	DIZZY	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
L543979	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
L543978	u7833	m530	DIZZY	It stinks, you goin.
L543882	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You got it.
L543881	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Cover me.
L543880	u7833	m530	DIZZY	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
L543879	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What ?
L543878	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Flip six, three hole.
L543877	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Man, they're defended... no way in.
L543808	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You saying you didn't ?
L543807	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
L543806	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
L543805	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What's your malfunction, Rico ?
L543804	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No thanks, Diz.
L543803	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
L543624	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're the best.
L543623	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Guess you gotta go.
L543622	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, look, Diz...
L543621	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Sure.
L543620	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
L543619	u7833	m530	DIZZY	How come we never got together ?
L543618	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
L543617	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
L543616	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You still gonna play for Brazil ?
L543614	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Too bad for her if she's not around.
L543613	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
L543612	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
L543581	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Just throw me the ball, Diz.
L543580	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
L543579	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What ?
L543566	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hut... hut !
L543565	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	A lot can happen in three minutes.
L543996	u7838	m530	MOTHER	This time of the year...?
L543995	u7834	m530	FATHER	Looks like rain.
L543994	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Oh, my, what's that ?
L543993	u7834	m530	FATHER	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
L543992	u7838	m530	MOTHER	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
L543991	u7834	m530	FATHER	Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
L543723	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
L543722	u7834	m530	FATHER	...CUT OFF !
L543610	u7834	m530	FATHER	Teenagers !
L543609	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
L543603	u7834	m530	FATHER	"A year at Harvard and you'll  see this ""Federal Service"" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves ""citizens"" and take airs for the rest of their lives."
L543602	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Good good, then it's all settled.
L543591	u7834	m530	FATHER	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
L543590	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
L543988	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
L543987	u7834	m530	FATHER	Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
L543720	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
L543719	u7834	m530	FATHER	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
L543718	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I won't quit !
L543717	u7834	m530	FATHER	You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
L543605	u7834	m530	FATHER	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
L543604	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
L543601	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
L543600	u7834	m530	FATHER	A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
L543597	u7834	m530	FATHER	Oh, is that how it is ?
L543596	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
L543595	u7834	m530	FATHER	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
L543594	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
L543593	u7834	m530	FATHER	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
L543592	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mr. Rasczak.
L543589	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
L543588	u7834	m530	FATHER	Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
L543586	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
L543585	u7834	m530	FATHER	This came for you today. I presume on your request.
L544270	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	AAAAAAAAAAA !
L544269	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
L544265	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Keep trying, Sergeant.
L544264	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
L544217	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
L544216	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
L544215	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
L544214	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
L544213	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
L544254	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
L544253	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
L544252	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
L544251	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
L544250	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
L544249	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
L544248	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
L544230	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
L544229	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
L544228	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
L544227	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
L544176	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
L544175	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
L544171	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I wouldn't mind.
L544170	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
L544169	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
L544022	u7844	m530	ZIM	Doesn't look like it to me.
L544021	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes it is, sir.
L544020	u7844	m530	ZIM	Is that your signature, Rico ?
L543913	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir !
L543912	u7844	m530	ZIM	The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
L543887	u7844	m530	ZIM	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
L543886	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, thank you, sir !
L543885	u7844	m530	ZIM	Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
L543685	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
L543684	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
L543683	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Courage, I guess.
L543682	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
L543681	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, sir.
L543680	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Are your parents currently citizens ?
L543679	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Here in Buenos Aires.
L543678	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
L543990	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
L543989	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
L543985	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
L543984	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hi, mom.
L543983	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
L543725	u7838	m530	MOTHER	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
L543724	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, yeah, sure...
L543608	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
L543607	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
L543606	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
L543599	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, no.
L543598	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
L543584	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, don't get mushy.
L543583	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
L544489	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
L544488	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Don't be a hero...
L544487	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
L544486	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Alright, we're gonna carry you...
L544485	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Been better, buddy.
L544484	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How bad are you, pal ?
L544476	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
L544475	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Not a problem.
L544474	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Can you walk ?
L544452	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Move out.
L544451	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Let's go.
L544450	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, that's right.
L544449	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
L544448	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna save Carmen.
L544447	u7843	m530	ZANDER	What do you think you're doing ?
L544437	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
L544436	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
L544427	u7843	m530	ZANDER	The Rodger Young just burned up...
L544426	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
L544416	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
L544415	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
L544414	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
L544413	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
L544412	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
L544353	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
L544352	u7843	m530	ZANDER	On whose authority, Corporal ?
L544072	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
L544071	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
L544070	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
L544067	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
L544066	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Best in the Fleet !
L543576	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You can never be sure.
L543575	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
L544319	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
L544318	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
L544317	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
L544316	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	What is your position ?
L544315	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
L544314	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
L544344	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Give'em hell, sir !
L544343	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
L544342	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're not leaving you here, sir !
L544341	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
L544340	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
L544339	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hit your jets, sir !
L544338	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Cover us, Ace !
L544337	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	AAAAAAAAAAAA !
L544333	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
L544332	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Sergeant, secure the boat !
L544308	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's going on, Diz ?
L544307	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
L544284	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
L544283	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	What's that look like to you, Rico ?
L544279	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir.
L544278	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
L544260	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Who's that with you ?
L544259	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
L544258	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
L544243	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
L544242	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir...
L544241	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
L544233	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir.
L544232	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Kill the bitch.
L544231	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All dead except one, sir.
L544200	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
L544199	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
L544198	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
L543640	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
L543639	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
L543638	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Good for you. Go find out.
L543637	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
L543636	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
L543635	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
L543634	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	What is it, Rico ?
L543633	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mister Rasczak ?
L543483	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
L543482	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, I don't know.
L543481	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
L543480	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
L543479	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
L545227	u7849	m531	KIRK	We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
L545226	u7845	m531	ILIA	<U>Answer</U>!
L545225	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our data is being prepared.
L545155	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
L545154	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
L545152	u7849	m531	KIRK	The information will not be disclosed.
L545151	u7845	m531	ILIA	They have repressed the Creator.
L545150	u7849	m531	KIRK	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
L545149	u7845	m531	ILIA	Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
L545138	u7845	m531	ILIA	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
L545137	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
L545136	u7845	m531	ILIA	Disclose the information.
L545124	u7845	m531	ILIA	You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
L545123	u7849	m531	KIRK	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
L545122	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator has not answered.
L545121	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>?!
L545120	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
L545119	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>...?!
L544968	u7845	m531	ILIA	You may proceede.
L544967	u7849	m531	KIRK	The examination is a normal function.
L544963	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
L544962	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is V'ger?
L544961	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator is that which created V'ger.
L544957	u7845	m531	ILIA	To join with him.
L544956	u7849	m531	KIRK	Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
L544955	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
L544954	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
L544952	u7845	m531	ILIA	That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
L544951	u7849	m531	KIRK	Where is Lt. Ilia?
L544949	u7849	m531	KIRK	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
L544948	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which programmed me.
L544947	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is...'V'ger'...?
L545236	u7845	m531	ILIA	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
L545235	u7847	m531	DECKER	And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
L545108	u7847	m531	DECKER	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
L545107	u7845	m531	ILIA	'To learn all that is learnable.'
L545106	u7847	m531	DECKER	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
L545105	u7845	m531	ILIA	As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
L545093	u7845	m531	ILIA	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
L545092	u7847	m531	DECKER	To join, and become One with the Creator?
L545091	u7845	m531	ILIA	By the Creator.
L545090	u7847	m531	DECKER	A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
L545038	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is how V'ger will survive.
L545037	u7847	m531	DECKER	You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
L545035	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
L545034	u7847	m531	DECKER	Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
L545012	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is logical. You may procede.
L545011	u7847	m531	DECKER	Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
L545010	u7845	m531	ILIA	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
L545009	u7847	m531	DECKER	What does that mean?
L545008	u7845	m531	ILIA	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
L545007	u7847	m531	DECKER	Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
L545006	u7845	m531	ILIA	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
L545005	u7847	m531	DECKER	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
L545004	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
L545003	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes.
L545002	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
L545001	u7847	m531	DECKER	The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
L545203	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
L545202	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
L545170	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering...
L545169	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
L545168	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
L545017	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
L545016	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
L544944	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
L544943	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
L544763	u7849	m531	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
L544762	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
L544682	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Departure angle.
L544681	u7849	m531	KIRK	Departure angle on viewer.
L545253	u7849	m531	KIRK	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
L545252	u7847	m531	DECKER	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
L545251	u7849	m531	KIRK	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
L545250	u7847	m531	DECKER	The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
L545221	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain... I'd like to go along...
L545220	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
L545209	u7849	m531	KIRK	No!
L545208	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
L545207	u7849	m531	KIRK	    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
L545167	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
L545166	u7849	m531	KIRK	Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
L545163	u7849	m531	KIRK	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
L545162	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, what's the next move?
L544923	u7849	m531	KIRK	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
L544922	u7847	m531	DECKER	Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
L544909	u7849	m531	KIRK	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
L544908	u7847	m531	DECKER	The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
L544901	u7849	m531	KIRK	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
L544900	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's taken control of the computer...!
L544899	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Computer off</U>!
L544868	u7847	m531	DECKER	You asked my opinion, sir.
L544867	u7849	m531	KIRK	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
L544866	u7847	m531	DECKER	That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
L544865	u7849	m531	KIRK	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
L544864	u7847	m531	DECKER	I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
L544819	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr Decker....
L544818	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
L544815	u7849	m531	KIRK	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
L544814	u7847	m531	DECKER	Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
L544774	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
L544773	u7847	m531	DECKER	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
L544772	u7849	m531	KIRK	If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
L544748	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
L544747	u7849	m531	KIRK	I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
L544746	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
L544745	u7849	m531	KIRK	Granted.
L544744	u7847	m531	DECKER	Permission to speak freely, sir?
L544743	u7849	m531	KIRK	Stop competing with me, Decker!
L544742	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm aware of that, sir.
L544741	u7849	m531	KIRK	You saved the ship.
L544740	u7847	m531	DECKER	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
L544739	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then you acted properly, of course.
L544738	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
L544737	u7849	m531	KIRK	Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
L544692	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
L544691	u7847	m531	DECKER	... but I still recommend further simulation study.
L544690	u7847	m531	DECKER	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
L544689	u7849	m531	KIRK	Programming ready?
L544618	u7849	m531	KIRK	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
L544617	u7847	m531	DECKER	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
L544616	u7849	m531	KIRK	We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
L544599	u7847	m531	DECKER	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
L544598	u7849	m531	KIRK	That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
L544596	u7847	m531	DECKER	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
L544595	u7849	m531	KIRK	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
L544594	u7847	m531	DECKER	May I ask Why?
L544593	u7849	m531	KIRK	Yes.
L544592	u7847	m531	DECKER	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
L544591	u7849	m531	KIRK	You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
L544590	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
L544589	u7847	m531	DECKER	You are what...?
L544588	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
L545255	u7847	m531	DECKER	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
L545254	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
L545217	u7847	m531	DECKER	   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
L545216	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
L545193	u7853	m531	SPOCK	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
L545192	u7847	m531	DECKER	Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
L545161	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A tractor beam...
L545160	u7847	m531	DECKER	Forward motion, Captain...!
L545126	u7847	m531	DECKER	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
L545125	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
L544980	u7847	m531	DECKER	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
L544979	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
L544975	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
L544974	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
L544973	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
L544903	u7853	m531	SPOCK	This served the purpose.
L544902	u7847	m531	DECKER	We could have cut it off at the main computer...
L544858	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
L544857	u7847	m531	DECKER	They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
L544754	u7848	m531	ILIA	No.
L544753	u7847	m531	DECKER	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
L544752	u7848	m531	ILIA	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
L544751	u7847	m531	DECKER	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
L544750	u7848	m531	ILIA	Was he difficult?
L544712	u7847	m531	DECKER	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
L544711	u7848	m531	ILIA	Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
L544709	u7848	m531	ILIA	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
L544708	u7847	m531	DECKER	Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
L544656	u7848	m531	ILIA	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
L544655	u7847	m531	DECKER	I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
L544642	u7848	m531	ILIA	Decker....!
L544641	u7847	m531	DECKER	Hello, Ilia.
L544870	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer, standard ahead.
L544869	u7848	m531	ILIA	Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
L544861	u7849	m531	KIRK	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
L544860	u7848	m531	ILIA	Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
L544846	u7848	m531	ILIA	Ten seconds....
L544845	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
L544844	u7848	m531	ILIA	Impact in fifteen seconds...
L544843	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Spock?
L544824	u7849	m531	KIRK	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
L544823	u7848	m531	ILIA	Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
L544715	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
L544714	u7848	m531	ILIA	Twelve seconds...!
L544713	u7849	m531	KIRK	Time to impact...?
L544648	u7848	m531	ILIA	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
L544647	u7849	m531	KIRK	And in you, too, Lieutenant.
L544645	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our Exec and Science Officer...
L544644	u7848	m531	ILIA	'Commander' Decker?
L544640	u7849	m531	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
L544639	u7848	m531	ILIA	Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
L545142	u7849	m531	KIRK	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
L545141	u7854	m531	SULU	Clear the bridge, Captain...?
L544936	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station keeping...
L544935	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station...!
L544932	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters ahead, one third.
L544931	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
L544930	u7854	m531	SULU	Viewer ahead, sir.
L544929	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer ahead.
L544890	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold relative position here...
L544889	u7854	m531	SULU	One hundred kilometers...
L544888	u7849	m531	KIRK	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
L544887	u7854	m531	SULU	We're already two settings below that, sir.
L544886	u7849	m531	KIRK	Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
L544872	u7854	m531	SULU	Aye, sir.
L544871	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
L544700	u7854	m531	SULU	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
L544699	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
L544676	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
L544675	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station.
L544674	u7854	m531	SULU	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
L544673	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
L544575	u7854	m531	SULU	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
L544574	u7849	m531	KIRK	I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
L544608	u7849	m531	KIRK	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
L544607	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're losing the pattern...!
L544562	u7849	m531	KIRK	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
L544561	u7850	m531	SCOTT	The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
L544558	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
L544557	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
L544556	u7849	m531	KIRK	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
L544555	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
L544554	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
L544553	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
L545260	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
L545259	u7849	m531	KIRK	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
L545258	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
L545257	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
L545238	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
L545237	u7849	m531	KIRK	There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
L545224	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
L545223	u7849	m531	KIRK	V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
L545206	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
L545205	u7849	m531	KIRK	The point... 
L545204	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
L545191	u7849	m531	KIRK	There is no alternative.
L545190	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
L545187	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
L545186	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not for us?
L545158	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Precisely.
L545157	u7849	m531	KIRK	The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
L545131	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
L545130	u7849	m531	KIRK	Child...!?
L545113	u7849	m531	KIRK	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
L545112	u7853	m531	SPOCK	These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
L545078	u7853	m531	SPOCK	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
L545077	u7849	m531	KIRK	What answers?
L545076	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
L545075	u7849	m531	KIRK	What should you have known?
L545069	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
L545068	u7849	m531	KIRK	Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
L545059	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
L545058	u7849	m531	KIRK	If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
L545057	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
L545056	u7849	m531	KIRK	Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
L545054	u7853	m531	SPOCK	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
L545053	u7849	m531	KIRK	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
L545052	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
L545050	u7849	m531	KIRK	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
L545049	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am seeking answers, Captain.
L545048	u7849	m531	KIRK	Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
L544988	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
L544987	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock? Concerned about his chances?
L544978	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
L544977	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
L544976	u7849	m531	KIRK	They had a pattern to follow...
L544940	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
L544939	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
L544915	u7849	m531	KIRK	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
L544914	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
L544911	u7849	m531	KIRK	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
L544910	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
L544881	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
L544880	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
L544874	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
L544873	u7849	m531	KIRK	No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
L544863	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... ?
L544862	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Recommend we proceede, Captain.
L544856	u7849	m531	KIRK	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
L544855	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
L544854	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our... 'insignificance'?
L544853	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
L544850	u7849	m531	KIRK	Any reply from them?
L544849	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
L544827	u7849	m531	KIRK	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
L544826	u7853	m531	SPOCK	They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
L544821	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
L544820	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
L544810	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
L544809	u7849	m531	KIRK	Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
L544801	u7849	m531	KIRK	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
L544800	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
L544799	u7849	m531	KIRK	Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
L544798	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
L544797	u7849	m531	KIRK	And whatever you sensed out here....
L544796	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I still contain fragments of my human half.
L544793	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
L544792	u7849	m531	KIRK	Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
L544791	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
L544790	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
L544789	u7849	m531	KIRK	I want him here.  Sit down!
L544788	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
L544787	u7849	m531	KIRK	Sit down, please.
L544786	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Reporting as ordered, Captain.
L544552	u7849	m531	KIRK	I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
L544551	u7852	m531	SONAK	To you, sir?
L544550	u7849	m531	KIRK	Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
L544549	u7852	m531	SONAK	Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
L544548	u7849	m531	KIRK	Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
L544547	u7852	m531	SONAK	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
L544546	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't you on board?
L544545	u7852	m531	SONAK	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
L544544	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
L545201	u7849	m531	KIRK	Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
L545200	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	We're ready, sir.
L545199	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
L544732	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
L544731	u7849	m531	KIRK	That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
L544730	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
L544729	u7849	m531	KIRK	Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
L544694	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
L544693	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
L545182	u7854	m531	SULU	Tractor beam remains constant...
L545181	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
L545115	u7855	m531	UHURA	<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
L545114	u7854	m531	SULU	The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
L545015	u7854	m531	SULU	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
L545014	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
L544706	u7855	m531	UHURA	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
L544705	u7854	m531	SULU	Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
L544670	u7854	m531	SULU	Helm ready, sir.
L544669	u7855	m531	UHURA	Dock control reports ready, sir.
L544634	u7854	m531	SULU	Dock signals clear, Captain.
L544633	u7855	m531	UHURA	Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
L555709	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
L555708	u7967	m540	ALURA	But what will happen?
L555707	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
L555706	u7967	m540	ALURA	But the Power Source, Zaltar.
L555702	u7967	m540	ALURA	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
L555701	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
L555699	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
L555698	u7967	m540	ALURA	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
L555697	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
L555694	u7967	m540	ALURA	But where?
L555693	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
L556197	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do you mean we?
L556196	u7968	m540	BIANCA	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
L556195	u7978	m540	SELENA	At last. Ultimate Power.
L556140	u7978	m540	SELENA	That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
L556139	u7968	m540	BIANCA	She didn't take it from you, did she?
L556138	u7978	m540	SELENA	I don't feel like it right now.
L556136	u7978	m540	SELENA	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
L556135	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
L556086	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
L556085	u7978	m540	SELENA	No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
L556084	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Home?
L555971	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
L555970	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Whatever you say.
L555969	u7978	m540	SELENA	I think I'd better keep it.
L555968	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
L555967	u7978	m540	SELENA	Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
L555965	u7968	m540	BIANCA	The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
L555964	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do I do?  I don't know her name.
L555962	u7968	m540	BIANCA	That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
L555961	u7978	m540	SELENA	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
L555960	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
L555959	u7978	m540	SELENA	Am I? Still?
L555958	u7968	m540	BIANCA	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
L555957	u7978	m540	SELENA	That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
L555956	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Eliminate her.
L555955	u7978	m540	SELENA	Why did she have to show up now?
L555938	u7978	m540	SELENA	No, a super girl.
L555937	u7968	m540	BIANCA	A Storm Dragon?
L555936	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's what we were warned about.
L555935	u7968	m540	BIANCA	I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
L555863	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Have fun.
L555862	u7978	m540	SELENA	He will be. In about five minutes.
L555861	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Is he your entertainment for tonight?
L555839	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Sorry, mistress.
L555838	u7978	m540	SELENA	Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
L555837	u7968	m540	BIANCA	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
L555836	u7978	m540	SELENA	We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
L555835	u7978	m540	SELENA	Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
L555834	u7968	m540	BIANCA	But which one?
L555833	u7978	m540	SELENA	It must be the girls. One of the girls.
L555832	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Softball.
L555831	u7978	m540	SELENA	Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
L555830	u7968	m540	BIANCA	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
L555829	u7978	m540	SELENA	What does it mean?
L555828	u7978	m540	SELENA	The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
L555827	u7968	m540	BIANCA	What is it?
L555826	u7978	m540	SELENA	I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
L555778	u7978	m540	SELENA	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
L555777	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Maybe it was just an accident.
L555776	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's a warning, that's for sure.
L555775	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Is this Nigel's doing?
L555753	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
L555752	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
L555751	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Western Europe.
L555750	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do you want?
L555749	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
L556429	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Do you want to come to Argo City?
L556428	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She's right. They'll string her up.
L556426	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I'll come back as soon as I can.
L556425	u7970	m540	ETHAN	No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
L556406	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Turn it against her.
L556405	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	How do I fight it?
L556404	u7970	m540	ETHAN	It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
L556397	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She has hostages.
L556396	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
L556228	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Yes.
L556227	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	And you can see how you feel about me, right?
L556226	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
L556225	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What?
L556224	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Before you go...
L556223	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
L556222	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Wait. Don't leave me.
L556221	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
L556220	u7970	m540	ETHAN	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
L556219	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
L556218	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
L556217	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
L556216	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She'll forget about us eventually.
L556215	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
L556214	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
L556213	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"Are you asking me for a ""date""?"
L556212	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
L556211	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
L556210	u7970	m540	ETHAN	But what if---it wasn't real?
L556209	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I don't see why not.
L556208	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You think so?
L556206	u7970	m540	ETHAN	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
L556205	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	And now?
L556204	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
L556203	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Miss what?
L556202	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
L556201	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It seemed that way to me.
L556200	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm not mad at you.
L556199	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
L556198	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hi.
L556193	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But I don't understand.
L556192	u7970	m540	ETHAN	That makes it worse.
L556191	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I sort of like what you said.
L556190	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
L556189	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But why?
L556188	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Away. From you.
L556185	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Like turning off a light.
L556184	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Just like that?
L556183	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't love you any more.
L556182	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
L556181	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She said it wouldn't last.
L556152	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
L556151	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
L556149	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
L556148	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
L556147	u7970	m540	ETHAN	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
L556146	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
L556123	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Terrific.
L556122	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Is this how?
L556121	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Well...I guess one is all right.
L556120	u7970	m540	ETHAN	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
L556119	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
L556118	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You're not afraid are you?
L556117	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	No.
L556116	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let me kiss you.
L556115	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What's that?
L556114	u7970	m540	ETHAN	There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
L556112	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What do you feel about me?
L556111	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
L556110	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You don't like me? You hate me?
L556109	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	All this talk about love, it's silly.
L556108	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
L556107	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We're from different worlds.
L556106	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why not ?
L556105	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We can't do that.
L556104	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
L556103	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
L556102	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
L556101	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Tell me where I can find her.
L556100	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let's talk about us, not her.
L556099	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
L556098	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
L556097	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Come on, let's ride.
L556096	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
L556095	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
L556094	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
L556093	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Where Superman's from? Krypton?
L556092	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Yes. It reminds me of home.
L556091	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Like it?
L556090	u7970	m540	ETHAN	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
L556089	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
L556088	u7970	m540	ETHAN	This is my favourite place in the city.
L556083	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
L556082	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We have to have a long talk about all this.
L556081	u7970	m540	ETHAN	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
L556080	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You love me?
L556079	u7970	m540	ETHAN	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
L556078	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Who didn't?
L556077	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You're alive! She didn't kill you!
L555944	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
L555943	u7970	m540	ETHAN	When can I see, you again ?
L555942	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I have to.
L555941	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Don't leave me.
L555933	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Later.
L555932	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
L555931	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I'm taking you to the hospital.
L555930	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What's happening?
L555929	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's for your own protection.
L555928	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Wait...don't leave me in here...
L556353	u7975	m540	LUCY	Well thanks a pile, fella.
L556352	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I did.
L556351	u7975	m540	LUCY	Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
L556322	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll mention it upstairs.
L556321	u7975	m540	LUCY	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
L556320	u7970	m540	ETHAN	A little.
L556317	u7975	m540	LUCY	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
L556316	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hmmm?
L556315	u7975	m540	LUCY	Hey! Ethan!
L556366	u7978	m540	SELENA	That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
L556365	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why the empty cage?
L556363	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
L556362	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well...I guess I can't.
L556361	u7978	m540	SELENA	You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
L556358	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Supergirl?
L556357	u7978	m540	SELENA	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
L556356	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't know. You seem afraid.
L556355	u7978	m540	SELENA	Guess! Go on.
L556299	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Yeah.
L556298	u7978	m540	SELENA	They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
L556242	u7978	m540	SELENA	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
L556241	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You vicious--
L556240	u7978	m540	SELENA	You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
L556239	u7978	m540	SELENA	Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
L556238	u7970	m540	ETHAN	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
L556237	u7978	m540	SELENA	I could force you.
L556236	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
L556037	u7978	m540	SELENA	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
L556036	u7970	m540	ETHAN	No!
L556035	u7978	m540	SELENA	Come back to my house. My car's outside.
L556034	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't want your help.
L556033	u7978	m540	SELENA	This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
L556026	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse! Help !
L556025	u7978	m540	SELENA	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
L556024	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse!
L556023	u7978	m540	SELENA	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
L556022	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse! Nurse!
L556020	u7978	m540	SELENA	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
L556019	u7970	m540	ETHAN	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
L556018	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
L556016	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
L556015	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why should I believe you?
L556014	u7978	m540	SELENA	"This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion."
L556013	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know it.
L556012	u7978	m540	SELENA	And you think you're in love.
L556011	u7970	m540	ETHAN	They think I have a concussion.
L556010	u7978	m540	SELENA	What an adorable hat.
L556009	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Oh no, not you again.
L555882	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll drink to that.
L555881	u7978	m540	SELENA	To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
L555880	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well, just one.
L555879	u7978	m540	SELENA	A passionfruit smoothee.
L555878	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What is it?
L555871	u7978	m540	SELENA	Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
L555870	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
L555869	u7978	m540	SELENA	I bet they do.
L555868	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
L555867	u7978	m540	SELENA	You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
L555866	u7978	m540	SELENA	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
L555865	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well, there's several ways to go .
L555864	u7978	m540	SELENA	Finished your estimate?
L555724	u7978	m540	SELENA	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
L555723	u7971	m540	GEORGE	What about my proposal?
L555722	u7978	m540	SELENA	I've got things to do.
L555721	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Hey, where you going?
L555717	u7978	m540	SELENA	George---I thought you'd never ask.
L555716	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
L555715	u7978	m540	SELENA	Why George, are you proposing?
L555714	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
L555713	u7978	m540	SELENA	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
L555712	u7971	m540	GEORGE	You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
L556065	u7972	m540	JIMMY	The scoop of the year!
L556064	u7974	m540	LINDA	Yes.
L556063	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
L556062	u7974	m540	LINDA	Someone's chasing him.
L556053	u7972	m540	JIMMY	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
L556052	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, no thanks.
L556051	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Can I give you a lift?
L556046	u7974	m540	LINDA	Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
L556045	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
L556007	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
L556006	u7974	m540	LINDA	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
L556005	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
L555999	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Can I quote you?
L555998	u7974	m540	LINDA	I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
L555995	u7972	m540	JIMMY	How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
L555994	u7974	m540	LINDA	Theories?
L555993	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Do you have any theories about last night?
L555990	u7974	m540	LINDA	Nice to meet you.
L555989	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
L556376	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're supposed to guess.
L556375	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Why didn't you tell me?
L556374	u7975	m540	LUCY	You bet your ass.
L556373	u7972	m540	JIMMY	You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
L556372	u7975	m540	LUCY	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
L556371	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
L556314	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
L556313	u7975	m540	LUCY	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
L556312	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
L556310	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
L556309	u7975	m540	LUCY	I can't help it if men notice me.
L556308	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Did anybody notice you?
L556307	u7975	m540	LUCY	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
L556306	u7972	m540	JIMMY	How do you know?
L556305	u7975	m540	LUCY	I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
L556001	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Oh, sure.
L556000	u7975	m540	LUCY	Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
L555997	u7972	m540	JIMMY	-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
L555996	u7975	m540	LUCY	Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
L555745	u7973	m540	KARA	As brave as my father. As wise.
L555744	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
L555735	u7973	m540	KARA	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
L555734	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Superman will return it.
L555731	u7973	m540	KARA	I allowed it to escape the City.
L555730	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
L555729	u7973	m540	KARA	It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
L555728	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
L555727	u7973	m540	KARA	I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
L555705	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
L555704	u7973	m540	KARA	I'm sorry... I didn't know.
L555685	u7973	m540	KARA	Can you create life?
L555684	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You see, a tree is a living thing.
L555682	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
L555681	u7973	m540	KARA	I don't understand.
L555680	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
L555679	u7973	m540	KARA	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
L555678	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
L555677	u7973	m540	KARA	Where is Earth?
L555676	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
L555675	u7973	m540	KARA	What's a tree?
L555674	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's going to be a tree, I think.
L555673	u7973	m540	KARA	What are you making:
L556049	u7975	m540	LUCY	Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
L556048	u7974	m540	LINDA	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
L556047	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
L556004	u7975	m540	LUCY	Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
L556003	u7974	m540	LINDA	He's nice.
L556002	u7975	m540	LUCY	Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
L555992	u7975	m540	LUCY	Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
L555991	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
L555921	u7975	m540	LUCY	Somebody's gotta do something!!
L555920	u7974	m540	LINDA	Lucy; come back!
L555917	u7975	m540	LUCY	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
L555916	u7974	m540	LINDA	Why is he acting so strangely?
L555913	u7975	m540	LUCY	Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
L555912	u7974	m540	LINDA	It doesn't seem right.
L555911	u7975	m540	LUCY	Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
L555910	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
L555909	u7975	m540	LUCY	Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
L555852	u7975	m540	LUCY	You sure?
L555851	u7974	m540	LINDA	No thanks. You go on.
L555846	u7974	m540	LINDA	It was just a trim.
L555845	u7975	m540	LUCY	Your hair looks the same.
L555815	u7975	m540	LUCY	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
L555814	u7974	m540	LINDA	But what for?
L555813	u7975	m540	LUCY	Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
L555812	u7974	m540	LINDA	Must've been a defective puck.
L555811	u7975	m540	LUCY	How'd you do that?
L555810	u7975	m540	LUCY	She's a beast.
L555809	u7974	m540	LINDA	She did that deliberately.
L555807	u7974	m540	LINDA	Thank you. You're very kind.
L555806	u7975	m540	LUCY	Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
L555805	u7974	m540	LINDA	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
L555804	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're not...an orphan are you?
L555803	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'd rather not talk about it.
L555802	u7975	m540	LUCY	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
L555801	u7974	m540	LINDA	I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
L555800	u7975	m540	LUCY	This is all your clothes?
L555799	u7974	m540	LINDA	There isn't any.
L555798	u7975	m540	LUCY	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
L555797	u7974	m540	LINDA	I can do that.
L555903	u7974	m540	LINDA	Sure. Mate in five moves.
L555902	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	What? Me?
L555901	u7974	m540	LINDA	Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
L555860	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'd love to.
L555859	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
L555858	u7974	m540	LINDA	No, MR. Danvers.
L555857	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	No plans for the weekend, Linda?
L555789	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
L555788	u7974	m540	LINDA	I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
L555785	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'm Linda Lee.
L555784	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	What can I do for you?
L555783	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
L555782	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Don't you believe in knocking?
L556176	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nonsense.
L556175	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
L556174	u7978	m540	SELENA	Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
L556173	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
L556172	u7978	m540	SELENA	Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
L556161	u7978	m540	SELENA	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
L556160	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
L555896	u7978	m540	SELENA	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
L555895	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Nothing's wrong with my skin.
L555894	u7978	m540	SELENA	I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
L555893	u7977	m540	NIGEL	...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
L555892	u7978	m540	SELENA	I could teach you a thing or two now.
L555891	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
L555890	u7978	m540	SELENA	You're wasting your breath.
L555889	u7977	m540	NIGEL	I have to talk to you.
L555888	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nigel, get lost.
L555770	u7978	m540	SELENA	Throw him out.
L555769	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
L555768	u7978	m540	SELENA	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
L555767	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Balefire on you, Selena!
L555765	u7978	m540	SELENA	I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
L555764	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
L555763	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
L555761	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Cigarette?
L555760	u7978	m540	SELENA	Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
L555759	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
L555758	u7978	m540	SELENA	I just did. Because I have the Power.
L555757	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
L555756	u7978	m540	SELENA	I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
L555755	u7977	m540	NIGEL	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
L555754	u7978	m540	SELENA	Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
L556439	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That's home.
L556438	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
L556437	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
L556435	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
L556434	u7978	m540	SELENA	Where is inner space?
L556432	u7978	m540	SELENA	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
L556431	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
L556430	u7978	m540	SELENA	What's it like?
L556424	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
L556423	u7978	m540	SELENA	Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
L556422	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	For what?
L556421	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
L556403	u7978	m540	SELENA	Not yet.
L556402	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
L556399	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
L556398	u7978	m540	SELENA	The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
L556132	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Cheap but effective.
L556131	u7978	m540	SELENA	A cheap trick.
L556130	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
L556127	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I don't scare that easily.
L556126	u7978	m540	SELENA	I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
L556125	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Who are you ?
L555927	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
L555926	u7978	m540	SELENA	That was meant for me!
L556392	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar!
L556391	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Goodbye...
L556390	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
L556389	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar. Use the wand!
L556388	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
L556387	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Yes, mustn't stop.
L556386	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Don't stop. Keep moving.
L556385	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What's that? Never saw anything like that.
L556383	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Better than when I was a child.
L556382	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You can use the wand.
L556350	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
L556349	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."
L556348	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
L556347	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You're going to take me back?
L556345	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
L556344	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
L556343	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
L556342	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
L556341	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Then come with me.
L556340	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
L556338	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
L556337	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Then teach me how.
L556335	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
L556334	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Why?
L556333	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	But it's impossible.
L556332	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I knew it!
L556331	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	There is a way.
L556330	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
L556329	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
L556328	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
L556327	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
L556326	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
L556325	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar, please help me.
L556303	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
L556302	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That horrible woman!
L556292	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
L556291	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You look at them? How?
L556289	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
L556288	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
L556287	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Are you happy, Zaltar?
L556286	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
L556285	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's lovely. . .
L556283	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
L556282	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What? Palace? Hardly.
L556281	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""
L556279	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Criminals.
L556278	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Others?
L556277	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
L556276	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I know.
L556275	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
L556274	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
L556273	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Shouldnt've done that.
L556272	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
L556271	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
L556270	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I was on Earth...
L556269	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
L556268	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What is this place?
L556913	u7982	m541	BRAD	Nope.  Never. 
L556912	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
L556910	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
L556909	u7982	m541	BRAD	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
L556908	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad?
L556907	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
L556906	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
L556905	u7982	m541	BRAD	Brad.
L556904	u7986	m541	GUS	Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
L556901	u7986	m541	GUS	What? What did you tell me?
L556900	u7982	m541	BRAD	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
L556899	u7986	m541	GUS	There's no vodka in it.
L556898	u7982	m541	BRAD	Not enough vodka in it.
L556897	u7986	m541	GUS	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
L556896	u7982	m541	BRAD	S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
L556894	u7986	m541	GUS	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
L556893	u7982	m541	BRAD	Tuesday.
L556892	u7986	m541	GUS	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
L556891	u7982	m541	BRAD	Mr. Roebush?
L556890	u7986	m541	GUS	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
L556889	u7982	m541	BRAD	What are you talkin' about?
L556888	u7986	m541	GUS	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
L556887	u7982	m541	BRAD	What?
L556886	u7986	m541	GUS	Buddy, are we in trouble.
L556885	u7982	m541	BRAD	Yeah? What do you want?
L556720	u7983	m541	CLARK	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
L556719	u7982	m541	BRAD	The kid needs a man to show him --
L556718	u7983	m541	CLARK	I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
L556717	u7982	m541	BRAD	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
L556716	u7983	m541	CLARK	Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
L556711	u7982	m541	BRAD	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
L556710	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
L556709	u7982	m541	BRAD	All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
L556708	u7983	m541	CLARK	I seem to be.
L556707	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
L556636	u7982	m541	BRAD	"Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  ""See"" I mean,  Hahaha!"
L556635	u7983	m541	CLARK	Brad Wilson.
L556634	u7982	m541	BRAD	Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
L557316	u7988	m541	LANA	Anyday...
L557315	u7983	m541	CLARK	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
L557314	u7988	m541	LANA	I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
L557031	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
L557030	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
L556932	u7988	m541	LANA	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
L556931	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I always loved porch swings.
L556883	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
L556882	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, aren't you excited?
L556881	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh-huh.
L556880	u7988	m541	LANA	He really was!
L556861	u7983	m541	CLARK	Can I help?
L556860	u7988	m541	LANA	The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
L556855	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
L556854	u7983	m541	CLARK	Call me.
L556853	u7988	m541	LANA	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
L556852	u7983	m541	CLARK	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
L556851	u7988	m541	LANA	That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
L556850	u7988	m541	LANA	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
L556849	u7983	m541	CLARK	Old ties are hard to cut.
L556848	u7988	m541	LANA	I can never get a way from it.
L556846	u7983	m541	CLARK	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
L556845	u7988	m541	LANA	So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
L556844	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me neither...
L556843	u7988	m541	LANA	Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
L556842	u7988	m541	LANA	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
L556841	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
L556840	u7988	m541	LANA	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
L556839	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, thanks.
L556838	u7988	m541	LANA	Peanut butter and jelly.
L556835	u7983	m541	CLARK	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
L556834	u7988	m541	LANA	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
L556833	u7983	m541	CLARK	There's a lot of choices here.
L556832	u7988	m541	LANA	And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
L556827	u7988	m541	LANA	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
L556826	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me??
L556825	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
L556824	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
L556823	u7988	m541	LANA	Some people don't think it's healthy.
L556822	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I haven't done this in years.
L556706	u7988	m541	LANA	I mean him.
L556705	u7983	m541	CLARK	But all he had was chocolate milk.
L556704	u7988	m541	LANA	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
L556703	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
L556702	u7988	m541	LANA	I just can't stand this.
L556671	u7988	m541	LANA	"I thought ""Clark Kent has a really nice voice."" You didn't even know I was there."
L556670	u7983	m541	CLARK	You thought that?
L556669	u7988	m541	LANA	That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
L556667	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh...I came close once.
L556666	u7988	m541	LANA	You...um...you never got married?
L556663	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
L556662	u7983	m541	CLARK	Who?
L556661	u7988	m541	LANA	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
L556660	u7983	m541	CLARK	But Lana, you could --
L556659	u7988	m541	LANA	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
L556658	u7983	m541	CLARK	I didn't --
L556657	u7988	m541	LANA	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
L556656	u7983	m541	CLARK	Too much mayonnaise?
L556655	u7988	m541	LANA	You know what's the problem?
L556654	u7988	m541	LANA	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
L556653	u7983	m541	CLARK	It sure is.
L556652	u7988	m541	LANA	And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
L556647	u7983	m541	CLARK	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
L556646	u7988	m541	LANA	You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
L556638	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
L556637	u7988	m541	LANA	"I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  ""Would you dance with me?"""
L556625	u7988	m541	LANA	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
L556624	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're welcome...??
L556623	u7988	m541	LANA	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
L556622	u7983	m541	CLARK	You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
L556619	u7983	m541	CLARK	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
L556618	u7988	m541	LANA	You look wonderful.
L556617	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark.
L556616	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana Lang. How great to see you.
L557351	u7983	m541	CLARK	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
L557350	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent!
L557349	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh...excuse me, folks...
L556529	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh. You're going away.
L556528	u7992	m541	PERRY	-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
L556517	u7983	m541	CLARK	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
L556516	u7992	m541	PERRY	I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
L556501	u7992	m541	PERRY	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
L556500	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
L556493	u7992	m541	PERRY	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
L556492	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
L557313	u7983	m541	CLARK	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
L557312	u7993	m541	RICKY	Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
L556940	u7993	m541	RICKY	Could you get me Superman's autograph?
L556939	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure.
L556938	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
L556937	u7983	m541	CLARK	We get together sometimes.
L556936	u7993	m541	RICKY	Do you really know Superman?
L556879	u7983	m541	CLARK	What!
L556878	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
L556830	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mom and I do this all the time.
L556829	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well...  Not quite like this.
L557336	u7989	m541	LOIS	Oh?
L557335	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
L557334	u7989	m541	LOIS	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
L557333	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're the best, Lois.
L556519	u7989	m541	LOIS	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
L556518	u7983	m541	CLARK	So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
L556511	u7983	m541	CLARK	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
L556510	u7989	m541	LOIS	Say!
L556509	u7983	m541	CLARK	Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
L556577	u7987	m541	JIMMY	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
L556576	u7983	m541	CLARK	What are you doing?
L556575	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
L556564	u7983	m541	CLARK	At one o'clock in the morning?
L556563	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
L556562	u7983	m541	CLARK	What's that?
L556561	u7987	m541	JIMMY	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
L556560	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mmmmm . . .
L556559	u7987	m541	JIMMY	But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
L556506	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
L556505	u7983	m541	CLARK	It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
L556462	u7986	m541	GUS	What about this week's check?
L556461	u7984	m541	CLERK	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
L556460	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
L556459	u7984	m541	CLERK	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
L556458	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, I'm the fault.
L556457	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
L556456	u7986	m541	GUS	"Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? ""Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!"" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet."
L556455	u7984	m541	CLERK	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
L556454	u7986	m541	GUS	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
L556453	u7984	m541	CLERK	A television set?
L556452	u7986	m541	GUS	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
L556451	u7984	m541	CLERK	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
L556450	u7986	m541	GUS	Thirty-five.
L556449	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
L556448	u7986	m541	GUS	Nope, but --
L556447	u7984	m541	CLERK	Dishwasher? Any luck?
L556446	u7986	m541	GUS	Kitchen. . . Technician
L556445	u7984	m541	CLERK	What kind?
L556444	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah.
L556443	u7984	m541	CLERK	Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
L556442	u7986	m541	GUS	Gus Gorman.
L556441	u7984	m541	CLERK	Name?
L556726	u7986	m541	GUS	Say who?
L556725	u7985	m541	FRED	The boss wants to see you.
L556724	u7986	m541	GUS	Say what?
L556723	u7985	m541	FRED	Gus?
L556555	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah. A raise . .
L556554	u7985	m541	FRED	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
L556553	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
L556552	u7985	m541	FRED	Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
L556550	u7986	m541	GUS	One.  And a half.
L556549	u7985	m541	FRED	How many sugars?
L556548	u7985	m541	FRED	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
L556547	u7986	m541	GUS	So where is all them half-centses?
L556546	u7985	m541	FRED	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
L556545	u7986	m541	GUS	Who gets it, the company?
L556544	u7985	m541	FRED	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
L556543	u7986	m541	GUS	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
L556542	u7985	m541	FRED	Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
L556541	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
L556540	u7985	m541	FRED	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
L556539	u7986	m541	GUS	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
L556538	u7985	m541	FRED	First paycheck?
L556537	u7986	m541	GUS	Sonofagun! Look at this here!
L557240	u7994	m541	ROSS	Join the party, genius! Come on up!
L557239	u7986	m541	GUS	Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
L557211	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
L557210	u7986	m541	GUS	You want to mess with Superman?
L557168	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
L557167	u7994	m541	ROSS	Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
L557166	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
L557165	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can you do that?
L557164	u7986	m541	GUS	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
L557163	u7994	m541	ROSS	But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
L557162	u7994	m541	ROSS	Exactly. Stoned mother.
L557161	u7986	m541	GUS	Stone mutha.
L557160	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking ""get-down hot-cha daddy-o"" whatever you called it."
L557159	u7986	m541	GUS	I told you it wasn't no jive.
L557158	u7994	m541	ROSS	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
L557157	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? How's it look?
L557126	u7994	m541	ROSS	Tell me more...
L557125	u7986	m541	GUS	Anything.
L557124	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it get me?
L557123	u7986	m541	GUS	Everything.
L557122	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it do?
L557121	u7986	m541	GUS	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
L557120	u7994	m541	ROSS	You designed it?
L557119	u7986	m541	GUS	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
L557118	u7994	m541	ROSS	We've already got some.
L557117	u7986	m541	GUS	A computer.
L557116	u7994	m541	ROSS	For what?
L557115	u7994	m541	ROSS	A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
L557114	u7994	m541	ROSS	What do you want?
L557113	u7986	m541	GUS	Fair's fair.
L557112	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this whitemail?
L557111	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
L557110	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this blackmail?
L557109	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
L557108	u7994	m541	ROSS	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
L557107	u7986	m541	GUS	Now...when do I get a taste?
L557105	u7986	m541	GUS	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
L557104	u7994	m541	ROSS	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
L557103	u7986	m541	GUS	Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
L557102	u7994	m541	ROSS	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
L557101	u7986	m541	GUS	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
L557100	u7994	m541	ROSS	And then shut down the pipe lines.
L557096	u7994	m541	ROSS	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
L557095	u7986	m541	GUS	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
L557094	u7994	m541	ROSS	And do nothing. Just sit there.
L557091	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
L557090	u7986	m541	GUS	They ain't got captains?
L557089	u7994	m541	ROSS	Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
L557081	u7986	m541	GUS	Huh?
L557080	u7994	m541	ROSS	KRYPTONITE!
L557079	u7986	m541	GUS	He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
L557017	u7986	m541	GUS	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
L557016	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
L557015	u7986	m541	GUS	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
L557014	u7994	m541	ROSS	God, that's what I keep you for.
L557013	u7986	m541	GUS	Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
L557010	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
L557009	u7986	m541	GUS	It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
L556983	u7994	m541	ROSS	What are you talking about, fella?
L556982	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...what channel were you watching?
L556981	u7994	m541	ROSS	I did. isn't it neat-o?
L556980	u7986	m541	GUS	Turn on the T.V.
L556979	u7994	m541	ROSS	Just the man I wanted to see!
L556978	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, boss.
L556816	u7986	m541	GUS	"Not ""What."" Don't need a genius to figure out ""what."" Need a genius to figure out ""where.""  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into."
L556815	u7994	m541	ROSS	What?
L556814	u7986	m541	GUS	"First question got to be ""Where."""
L556813	u7994	m541	ROSS	When?
L556812	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
L556811	u7994	m541	ROSS	Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
L556786	u7994	m541	ROSS	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
L556785	u7986	m541	GUS	How do you do that?
L556779	u7986	m541	GUS	That what they call you?
L556778	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
L556775	u7986	m541	GUS	Me? How?
L556774	u7994	m541	ROSS	"A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... ""It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.""  And you are going to do it for me."
L556773	u7986	m541	GUS	But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
L556768	u7994	m541	ROSS	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
L556767	u7986	m541	GUS	Wipe 'em out?
L556766	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
L556765	u7986	m541	GUS	Columbia.
L556764	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia.
L556763	u7986	m541	GUS	Which country?
L556762	u7994	m541	ROSS	But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
L556761	u7986	m541	GUS	Decaffeinated too?
L556760	u7994	m541	ROSS	Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
L556758	u7994	m541	ROSS	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
L556757	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, what is this?
L556756	u7994	m541	ROSS	I don't think you understand.
L556755	u7986	m541	GUS	Black or regular?
L556754	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
L556753	u7986	m541	GUS	I'm tryin' to.
L556752	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
L556748	u7986	m541	GUS	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
L556747	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
L556746	u7986	m541	GUS	Or socks.
L556745	u7994	m541	ROSS	I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
L556744	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
L556743	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
L556742	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...
L556741	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- ""dig where you're comin' from.""  You want to be rich, right?"
L556740	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
L556739	u7994	m541	ROSS	You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
L556738	u7994	m541	ROSS	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
L556737	u7986	m541	GUS	Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
L557300	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
L557299	u7986	m541	GUS	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
L557298	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Thanks.  Let's go
L557293	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Just a second.
L557292	u7986	m541	GUS	Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
L557291	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No...I just have a little stop to make.
L557290	u7986	m541	GUS	We back in Metropolis?
L557289	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
L557288	u7986	m541	GUS	We gonna crash?
L557287	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, we're just going down.
L557286	u7986	m541	GUS	Watch out for them air pockets!
L557285	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
L557284	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
L557283	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
L557282	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
L557281	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	How you doing down there?
L557099	u7997	m541	VERA	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
L557098	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, by computers.
L557093	u7986	m541	GUS	And do what?
L557092	u7997	m541	VERA	You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
L556803	u7986	m541	GUS	What she call you?
L556802	u7997	m541	VERA	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
L556801	u7986	m541	GUS	Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
L556777	u7997	m541	VERA	Sister! I'm his sister!
L556776	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
L556796	u7987	m541	JIMMY	It was hot!
L556795	u7992	m541	PERRY	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
L556794	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Why do I have to do this?
L556525	u7987	m541	JIMMY	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
L556524	u7992	m541	PERRY	What about you?
L556523	u7987	m541	JIMMY	What about me?
L556522	u7992	m541	PERRY	All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
L556487	u7992	m541	PERRY	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
L556486	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I didn't have my camera with me.
L556485	u7992	m541	PERRY	You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
L556482	u7987	m541	JIMMY	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
L556481	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who's the other woman?
L556479	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
L556478	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who is she?
L557065	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
L557064	u7988	m541	LANA	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
L557063	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
L557062	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
L557061	u7988	m541	LANA	But the bridge...
L557060	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	There's no rush.
L557057	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You just did, with that great dinner.
L557056	u7988	m541	LANA	He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
L557039	u7988	m541	LANA	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
L557038	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
L556873	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
L556872	u7988	m541	LANA	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
L556871	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	We've already met.
L556870	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
L556869	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Anytime.
L556868	u7988	m541	LANA	Thank ...you.
L556867	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
L556866	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky?  Where...what...
L557332	u7989	m541	LOIS	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
L557331	u7992	m541	PERRY	Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
L556527	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
L556526	u7989	m541	LOIS	Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
L556504	u7989	m541	LOIS	Whoopee.
L556503	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
L556502	u7989	m541	LOIS	What terrific story?
L556484	u7989	m541	LOIS	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
L556483	u7992	m541	PERRY	The picture looks blurry.
L557245	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
L557244	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But the other night...
L557243	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I don't know you, lady.
L557144	u7990	m541	LORELEI	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
L557143	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
L557142	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
L557141	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
L557140	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
L557139	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Tell me.
L557138	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Lots of things...
L557137	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
L557136	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
L557135	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
L557134	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
L557133	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I thought you'd never get here.
L557266	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
L557265	u7997	m541	VERA	I can't! It's out of control!
L557234	u7990	m541	LORELEI	He can have mine. Anytime.
L557233	u7997	m541	VERA	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
L557232	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Oh, Superman!
L557230	u7990	m541	LORELEI	In other words, push this red button.
L557229	u7997	m541	VERA	You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
L557226	u7997	m541	VERA	Superman. The boy you left behind.
L557225	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Gus?
L557224	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
L557217	u7997	m541	VERA	Where do you usually find a light switch?
L557216	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Where's the light switch?
L557215	u7997	m541	VERA	Turn on the light.
L557214	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I can't see anything.
L557076	u7990	m541	LORELEI	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
L557075	u7997	m541	VERA	At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
L557003	u7997	m541	VERA	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
L557002	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Hey, I know a lot of things!
L557001	u7997	m541	VERA	How would you know?
L556968	u7997	m541	VERA	"Energy! And when they say ""Energy"" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped."
L556967	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Diet soda?
L556966	u7997	m541	VERA	Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
L556686	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
L556685	u7997	m541	VERA	If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
L556682	u7997	m541	VERA	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
L556681	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
L557347	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	There is no handle! You just push a button.
L557346	u7992	m541	PERRY	Where's the handle?
L557345	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
L556793	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why do I have to do this?
L556792	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
L556535	u7992	m541	PERRY	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
L556534	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
L556533	u7992	m541	PERRY	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
L556532	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, the next number, please?
L556499	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	You've got to pick three more numbers.
L556498	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay? Goodbye.
L556497	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	53!
L556496	u7992	m541	PERRY	53.
L556491	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
L556490	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
L556489	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
L556695	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
L556694	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
L556684	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Hello.
L556683	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
L556680	u7994	m541	ROSS	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
L556679	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	"I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up.""  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!"
L556676	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
L556675	u7994	m541	ROSS	Missing????
L556674	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	85,000 dollars.
L557258	u7994	m541	ROSS	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
L557257	u7997	m541	VERA	Yes! This time we got it right!
L557255	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't bet on it!
L557254	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
L557223	u7997	m541	VERA	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
L557222	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's the only one who can operate this --
L557221	u7997	m541	VERA	Who needs Gus?
L557220	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
L557219	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, let's give it a dry run.
L557128	u7997	m541	VERA	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
L557127	u7994	m541	ROSS	That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
L557085	u7997	m541	VERA	We can get to work on that oil!
L557084	u7994	m541	ROSS	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
L557083	u7997	m541	VERA	A normal person.
L557082	u7994	m541	ROSS	Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
L557012	u7994	m541	ROSS	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
L557011	u7997	m541	VERA	So?
L557008	u7994	m541	ROSS	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
L557007	u7997	m541	VERA	Where did it come from?
L557006	u7994	m541	ROSS	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
L557005	u7997	m541	VERA	What's wrong?
L557004	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
L556996	u7997	m541	VERA	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
L556995	u7994	m541	ROSS	Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
L556992	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't cry, Bubba.
L556991	u7994	m541	ROSS	He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
L556977	u7994	m541	ROSS	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
L556976	u7997	m541	VERA	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
L556975	u7994	m541	ROSS	We already have a super-tanker.
L556974	u7997	m541	VERA	Small potatoes.
L556971	u7994	m541	ROSS	TOMORROW THE OIL!
L556970	u7997	m541	VERA	Today coffee----
L556969	u7994	m541	ROSS	You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
L556818	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
L556817	u7997	m541	VERA	Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
L556807	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
L556806	u7997	m541	VERA	She's not his mama either.
L556800	u7997	m541	VERA	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
L556799	u7994	m541	ROSS	Computers talk to other computers, right?
L556784	u7997	m541	VERA	Blizzards! Heat waves!
L556783	u7994	m541	ROSS	Storms! Floods!
L556782	u7997	m541	VERA	It could make weather!
L556781	u7994	m541	ROSS	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
L556692	u7994	m541	ROSS	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
L556691	u7997	m541	VERA	I don't kiss.
L556678	u7994	m541	ROSS	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
L556677	u7997	m541	VERA	That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
L558690	u7998	m542	CLARK	She'll be fine.
L558689	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Are you okay?
L557999	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
L557998	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hostages?
L557997	u8001	m542	JIMMY	So far the hostages are unharmed.
L557996	u7998	m542	CLARK	Anybody been hurt?
L557985	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Yeah. I'll check.
L557984	u7998	m542	CLARK	Jimmy, how's the -
L558703	u8004	m542	LOIS	Everything on it.
L558702	u7998	m542	CLARK	Everything on it?
L558701	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
L558700	u7998	m542	CLARK	You do?
L558699	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
L558698	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'll try to remember that . . .
L558697	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
L558696	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I really don't see why --
L558695	u8004	m542	LOIS	. . . Superman?. . . . .
L558693	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
L558692	u7998	m542	CLARK	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
L558691	u8004	m542	LOIS	See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
L558684	u7998	m542	CLARK	I like worrying about you.
L558683	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Please don't tell me ""You'll find somebody else someday."" Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me."
L558682	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, someday --
L558681	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
L558680	u7998	m542	CLARK	What else could I do?
L558679	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say ""Help. Come quick. Now"" I know who you'd have to pick."
L558678	u7998	m542	CLARK	They?
L558677	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
L558676	u7998	m542	CLARK	You're not selfish at all.
L558675	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, ""It's like being married to a doctor,"" I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, "" could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . """
L558674	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'm sorry.
L558673	u8004	m542	LOIS	"I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I ""listened to the voices of  reason"" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?"
L558671	u8004	m542	LOIS	Never closed my eyes.
L558670	u7998	m542	CLARK	Sleep well?
L558669	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, hi.
L558668	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hi.
L558495	u7998	m542	CLARK	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
L558494	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
L558493	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
L558492	u8004	m542	LOIS	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
L558491	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
L558481	u7998	m542	CLARK	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
L558480	u8004	m542	LOIS	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
L558479	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
L558478	u8004	m542	LOIS	Let's get you inside . . . .
L558477	u7998	m542	CLARK	Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
L558473	u7998	m542	CLARK	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
L558472	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
L558450	u7998	m542	CLARK	Say you love me.
L558449	u8004	m542	LOIS	You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
L558286	u8004	m542	LOIS	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
L558285	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558284	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558283	u8004	m542	LOIS	I want to.
L558282	u7998	m542	CLARK	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
L558281	u8004	m542	LOIS	What's happening. Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
L558280	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
L558279	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm listening.
L558278	u7998	m542	CLARK	We'd better talk.
L558277	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
L558274	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
L558273	u7998	m542	CLARK	I didn't think I wanted to.
L558272	u8004	m542	LOIS	Maybe you wanted to.
L558269	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh come on, that's ridic -
L558268	u8004	m542	LOIS	I was right. you are Superman.
L558267	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I . . .
L558266	u8004	m542	LOIS	It's true. It's true.
L558248	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
L558247	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh Clark, no!
L558238	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558237	u8004	m542	LOIS	Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
L558236	u7998	m542	CLARK	How could you win a crazy bet like --
L558235	u8004	m542	LOIS	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
L558234	u7998	m542	CLARK	You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
L558233	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
L558232	u8004	m542	LOIS	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
L558231	u7998	m542	CLARK	Who ????
L558229	u7998	m542	CLARK	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
L558228	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
L558227	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
L558223	u8004	m542	LOIS	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
L558222	u7998	m542	CLARK	Superman? Oh, was he here?
L558221	u8004	m542	LOIS	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
L558220	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
L558219	u8004	m542	LOIS	Where were you?
L558208	u8004	m542	LOIS	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
L558207	u7998	m542	CLARK	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
L558206	u8004	m542	LOIS	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
L558205	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, you're amazing.
L558204	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
L558199	u8004	m542	LOIS	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
L558198	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
L558195	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Mr. Smith -  -- the ""complimentary couch."""
L558194	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
L558193	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
L558192	u7998	m542	CLARK	"A ""complimentary corsage."""
L558189	u8004	m542	LOIS	Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
L558187	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
L558186	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
L558185	u7998	m542	CLARK	'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
L558179	u8004	m542	LOIS	In July???
L558178	u7998	m542	CLARK	It is kinda romantic.
L558089	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course, that's what friends are for.
L558088	u7998	m542	CLARK	Really?
L558087	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
L558085	u8004	m542	LOIS	Be my guest.
L558084	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe I could try --
L558083	u8004	m542	LOIS	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
L558082	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
L558080	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
L558079	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually, yes.
L558078	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
L558077	u7998	m542	CLARK	I do?
L558076	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
L558075	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't?
L558072	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
L558071	u7998	m542	CLARK	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
L558070	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
L558069	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh. . .
L558068	u8004	m542	LOIS	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
L558067	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, what are you doing?
L558066	u8004	m542	LOIS	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
L558065	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
L558064	u8004	m542	LOIS	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
L558063	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I usually do.
L558009	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
L558008	u8007	m542	PERRY	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
L558007	u7998	m542	CLARK	Gee. But --
L558006	u8007	m542	PERRY	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
L558005	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558004	u8007	m542	PERRY	Does she know about it? She's in it!
L558003	u7998	m542	CLARK	Does Lois know about this yet?
L558002	u8007	m542	PERRY	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
L558001	u7998	m542	CLARK	But . . ..that's terrible!
L557993	u8007	m542	PERRY	Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
L557992	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
L557991	u8007	m542	PERRY	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
L557990	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh...home...
L557989	u8007	m542	PERRY	Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
L558335	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
L558334	u7999	m542	EVE	Good. My heart can't take it.
L558333	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	You'll miss the battle of the century!
L558315	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
L558314	u7999	m542	EVE	I like trees.
L558290	u7999	m542	EVE	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
L558289	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	A good time! Is that all you care about?!
L558288	u7999	m542	EVE	Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
L558287	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Mush!  Mush!
L558166	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	North!
L558165	u7999	m542	EVE	You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
L558164	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	A parka.
L558163	u7999	m542	EVE	A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
L558162	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	You'll have to pack quickly.
L558161	u7999	m542	EVE	There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
L558160	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
L558159	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	What else is ballast for?
L558158	u7999	m542	EVE	Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
L558302	u8003	m542	LEX	It's beautiful.
L558301	u7999	m542	EVE	That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
L558300	u8003	m542	LEX	Why didn't you go before we left?
L558299	u7999	m542	EVE	Wrong.
L558298	u8003	m542	LEX	It has everything.
L558297	u7999	m542	EVE	It's beautiful.
L558296	u8003	m542	LEX	It's beautiful.
L558295	u7999	m542	EVE	No, me, me, me. Thank you.
L558294	u8003	m542	LEX	I'll be alright.
L558293	u7999	m542	EVE	Genius!  --  Lex.

L558291	u7999	m542	EVE	This way Lex.

L558156	u7999	m542	EVE	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
L558155	u8003	m542	LEX	Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
L558142	u8000	m542	FIRST CONTROLLER	How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
L558141	u8009	m542	SECOND CONTROLLER	Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
L558140	u8000	m542	FIRST CONTROLLER	What's a curl?
L558139	u8009	m542	SECOND CONTROLLER	"I think he said a ""curl."""

L558528	u8007	m542	PERRY	Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
L558527	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
L558526	u8007	m542	PERRY	I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
L557995	u8007	m542	PERRY	He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
L557994	u8001	m542	JIMMY	A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
L557986	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
L558439	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes.
L558438	u8002	m542	LARA	And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
L558437	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
L558436	u8002	m542	LARA	Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
L558435	u8002	m542	LARA	Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
L558434	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes, but it's not all I feel.
L558433	u8002	m542	LARA	You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
L558432	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
L558431	u8002	m542	LARA	You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
L558328	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I didn't ask her anything . . .
L558327	u8002	m542	LARA	The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
L558326	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I asked the right question.
L558325	u8002	m542	LARA	The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
L558324	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	No possibility for parole?
L558323	u8002	m542	LARA	And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
L558322	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Sensible enough.
L558321	u8002	m542	LARA	The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
L558320	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	My kind of people.
L558319	u8002	m542	LARA	"For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as ""criminals."""
L558318	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Now This I want to hear.
L558317	u8002	m542	LARA	-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
L558109	u8006	m542	OTIS	Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
L558108	u8003	m542	LEX	That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.

L558106	u8003	m542	LEX	Shhhhhhh!
L558105	u8006	m542	OTIS	Oh! That black box in our cell?

L558101	u8006	m542	OTIS	North.
L558100	u8003	m542	LEX	Where?
L558099	u8006	m542	OTIS	I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.

L558095	u8006	m542	OTIS	Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...

L558427	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
L558426	u8004	m542	LOIS	It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
L558423	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
L558422	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
L558387	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
L558386	u8004	m542	LOIS	Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
L558385	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	So --  I hope you like it.
L558360	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
L558359	u8004	m542	LOIS	I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
L558358	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	You must be freezing.

L558665	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
L558664	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
L558663	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
L558662	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
L558661	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .

L558651	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
L558650	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
L558649	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
L558648	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
L558642	u8014	m542	ZOD	Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
L558641	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
L558621	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Put down Lex Luthor?
L558620	u8014	m542	ZOD	Put down Lex Luthor !
L558619	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	North. Keep going North!
L558618	u8014	m542	ZOD	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
L558617	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
L558614	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Cuba.
L558613	u8014	m542	ZOD	What more?
L558608	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
L558607	u8014	m542	ZOD	Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
L558603	u8014	m542	ZOD	He ran in fear from us . . .
L558488	u8014	m542	ZOD	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
L558487	u8008	m542	PRESIDENT	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
L558486	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this . . . Superman?
L558463	u8014	m542	ZOD	Zod.  Zod.
L558462	u8008	m542	PRESIDENT	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
L558461	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
L558458	u8014	m542	ZOD	It will. Starting with your own.
L558021	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
L558020	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	Yes, but will you honor it?
L558019	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
L558018	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
L558017	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
L558016	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
L558640	u8013	m542	URSA	Super-sucker .  For once, Lex Luthor was right.
L558639	u8014	m542	ZOD	Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
L558629	u8014	m542	ZOD	We must combine our strength.
L558628	u8013	m542	URSA	General --- ?
L558577	u8014	m542	ZOD	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
L558576	u8013	m542	URSA	He's captured Non!
L558575	u8013	m542	URSA	Sentimental idiot.
L558574	u8014	m542	ZOD	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
L558573	u8013	m542	URSA	Yes?
L558572	u8014	m542	ZOD	"This ""super"" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness."
L558499	u8014	m542	ZOD	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
L558498	u8013	m542	URSA	You are master of all you survey.
L558446	u8014	m542	ZOD	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
L558445	u8013	m542	URSA	Look, they need a machine to fly.
L558256	u8014	m542	ZOD	Stay. I will come to you.
L558255	u8013	m542	URSA	What shall we do now?
L558254	u8014	m542	ZOD	So this is the planet Houston . . .
L558150	u8014	m542	ZOD	And I will lead.
L558148	u8014	m542	ZOD	Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
L558146	u8014	m542	ZOD	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
L558145	u8013	m542	URSA	Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
L558056	u8013	m542	URSA	Free!
L558055	u8014	m542	ZOD	Free!
L559283	u8015	m543	CLARK	Lacy. . . I . . .
L559282	u8018	m543	LACY	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
L559281	u8015	m543	CLARK	You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
L559280	u8018	m543	LACY	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
L559279	u8015	m543	CLARK	Like me?
L559278	u8018	m543	LACY	Any more like you back home, Clark?
L559277	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not so sure you do.
L559276	u8018	m543	LACY	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
L559275	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm sorry to see you go.
L559274	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
L559110	u8018	m543	LACY	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
L559109	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I'm really sorry.
L559107	u8018	m543	LACY	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
L559106	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
L559096	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. . . !
L559095	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . my . . .
L559093	u8015	m543	CLARK	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
L559092	u8018	m543	LACY	I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
L559076	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
L559075	u8018	m543	LACY	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
L559066	u8018	m543	LACY	. . . Let me get my purse.
L559065	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
L559024	u8018	m543	LACY	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
L559023	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I don't think . . .
L559022	u8018	m543	LACY	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
L559021	u8015	m543	CLARK	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
L559020	u8018	m543	LACY	Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
L559019	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
L559018	u8018	m543	LACY	He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
L559011	u8015	m543	CLARK	If you say so. Here goes.
L559010	u8018	m543	LACY	Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
L559009	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
L559008	u8015	m543	CLARK	Maybe I should sit this one out.
L558916	u8015	m543	CLARK	Don't worry, I've got you.
L558915	u8018	m543	LACY	I feel kind of light-headed . . .
L558914	u8018	m543	LACY	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
L558913	u8015	m543	CLARK	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
L558912	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
L558911	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
L558910	u8018	m543	LACY	What about here?
L558909	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
L558908	u8018	m543	LACY	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
L558907	u8015	m543	CLARK	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
L558906	u8018	m543	LACY	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
L558905	u8015	m543	CLARK	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
L558904	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
L558899	u8018	m543	LACY	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
L558898	u8015	m543	CLARK	I've never been in a place like this before.
L558893	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
L558892	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
L558891	u8018	m543	LACY	You're late. Very late.
L558845	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
L558844	u8015	m543	CLARK	They make my eyes itch.
L558843	u8018	m543	LACY	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
L558842	u8015	m543	CLARK	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
L558841	u8018	m543	LACY	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
L558840	u8015	m543	CLARK	I really don't think . . .
L558839	u8018	m543	LACY	It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
L559290	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
L559289	u8021	m543	LOIS	It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
L559191	u8015	m543	CLARK	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
L559190	u8021	m543	LOIS	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
L559189	u8015	m543	CLARK	Superman? Has something happened to him?
L559187	u8021	m543	LOIS	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
L559186	u8015	m543	CLARK	It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
L559151	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
L559150	u8015	m543	CLARK	. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
L559070	u8015	m543	CLARK	Politely?
L559069	u8021	m543	LOIS	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
L559068	u8015	m543	CLARK	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
L558851	u8021	m543	LOIS	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
L558850	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
L558812	u8021	m543	LOIS	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
L558811	u8015	m543	CLARK	The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
L558801	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark . . . wait!
L558800	u8015	m543	CLARK	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
L558799	u8021	m543	LOIS	No Paris?
L558777	u8021	m543	LOIS	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
L558776	u8015	m543	CLARK	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
L558775	u8021	m543	LOIS	Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
L559175	u8020	m543	LEX	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
L559174	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
L559005	u8020	m543	LEX	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
L559004	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And what do we get out of it?
L559001	u8020	m543	LEX	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
L559000	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
L558999	u8020	m543	LEX	Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
L558997	u8020	m543	LEX	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
L558996	u8016	m543	HOWLER	But Superman isn't an average man.
L558995	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
L558994	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
L559310	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
L559309	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
L559308	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Go on . . .
L559307	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
L559306	u8017	m543	JEREMY	I'll try. . .
L559305	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
L559304	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Awesome!
L558967	u8017	m543	JEREMY	N-no...I mean...you bet.
L558966	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
L558963	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Absolutely!
L558962	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind taking a walk with me?
L558869	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry.
L558868	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well, I don't understand.
L558866	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
L558865	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
L558864	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
L558863	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Impossible? Why?
L559208	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
L559207	u8018	m543	LACY	No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
L559206	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
L559205	u8018	m543	LACY	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
L559204	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
L559160	u8018	m543	LACY	Stuff it.
L559159	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Yes, darling?
L559158	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy . . . ?
L559157	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
L559156	u8018	m543	LACY	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
L559155	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
L558930	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
L558929	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
L558928	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
L558927	u8018	m543	LACY	Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
L558798	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
L558797	u8018	m543	LACY	Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
L559105	u8021	m543	LOIS	It always is with Clark.
L559104	u8018	m543	LACY	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
L559103	u8021	m543	LOIS	Where's Clark?
L559079	u8021	m543	LOIS	Our other dinner guest.
L559078	u8018	m543	LACY	What's that?
L558974	u8021	m543	LOIS	Something . . . wonderful.
L558973	u8018	m543	LACY	What's he going to say?
L558957	u8018	m543	LACY	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
L558956	u8021	m543	LOIS	But he's never there.
L558955	u8018	m543	LACY	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
L558954	u8021	m543	LOIS	And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
L558953	u8018	m543	LACY	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
L558952	u8021	m543	LOIS	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
L558951	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
L558950	u8021	m543	LOIS	Who?
L558949	u8018	m543	LACY	I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
L558856	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
L558855	u8021	m543	LOIS	An angle?
L558854	u8018	m543	LACY	I think there's an angle.
L558849	u8018	m543	LACY	Superman gets mail here?
L558848	u8021	m543	LOIS	This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
L558809	u8021	m543	LOIS	. . . And  very na?ve!
L558808	u8018	m543	LACY	But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
L558807	u8021	m543	LOIS	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
L558806	u8018	m543	LACY	I think he's kind of cute.
L558804	u8021	m543	LOIS	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
L558803	u8018	m543	LACY	Is he for real?
L559260	u8019	m543	LENNY	Lucky I brought my drums.
L559259	u8020	m543	LEX	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
L559258	u8019	m543	LENNY	You think he'll find us.
L559229	u8020	m543	LEX	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
L559228	u8019	m543	LENNY	Ready, Uncle Lex?
L559227	u8020	m543	LEX	Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
L559218	u8019	m543	LENNY	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
L559217	u8020	m543	LEX	This wasn't in the plan.
L559216	u8019	m543	LENNY	We'll all fry.
L559132	u8020	m543	LEX	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
L559131	u8019	m543	LENNY	Boy, are you gonna get it.
L559056	u8019	m543	LENNY	What?
L559055	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
L559054	u8019	m543	LENNY	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
L559053	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . . cold. . .
L559052	u8020	m543	LEX	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
L559051	u8019	m543	LENNY	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
L559050	u8020	m543	LEX	What was that about?
L559043	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're just an experiment, freako!
L559042	u8020	m543	LEX	Hey! Just remember I made you.
L559036	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
L559035	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey! He looks . . . normal.
L559034	u8020	m543	LEX	There!
L559033	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
L559032	u8020	m543	LEX	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
L559031	u8019	m543	LENNY	The one Superman wrecked up?
L559030	u8020	m543	LEX	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
L559029	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
L558990	u8020	m543	LEX	Get the box, nephew.
L558989	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
L558924	u8020	m543	LEX	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
L558923	u8019	m543	LENNY	Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
L558889	u8020	m543	LEX	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
L558888	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
L558884	u8020	m543	LEX	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
L558883	u8019	m543	LENNY	Whoa. . .
L558877	u8020	m543	LEX	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
L558876	u8019	m543	LENNY	He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
L558838	u8020	m543	LEX	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
L558837	u8019	m543	LENNY	But why the hair?
L558836	u8020	m543	LEX	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
L558835	u8019	m543	LENNY	A toupee that flies?
L558834	u8020	m543	LEX	Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
L558767	u8020	m543	LEX	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
L558766	u8019	m543	LENNY	Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
L559200	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am master now.
L559199	u8020	m543	LEX	Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
L559183	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destiny.
L559182	u8020	m543	LEX	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
L559181	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What do you fear?
L559180	u8020	m543	LEX	Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
L559146	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	First, I have fun.
L559145	u8020	m543	LEX	Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
L559135	u8020	m543	LEX	Wait! Not yet! Back!
L559134	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destroy Superman!
L559046	u8020	m543	LEX	I made you, and I can destroy you.
L559045	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am an experiment? I am freako?

L559039	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . .

L558880	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What I need this for?
L559264	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
L559263	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
L559262	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
L559261	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . how could you beat him?
L559236	u8020	m543	LEX	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
L559235	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'll deal with you later.
L559232	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
L559231	u8020	m543	LEX	Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
L559144	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
L559143	u8020	m543	LEX	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
L559142	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
L559141	u8020	m543	LEX	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
L559140	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
L559139	u8020	m543	LEX	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
L559138	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
L559137	u8020	m543	LEX	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
L559136	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
L559129	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
L559128	u8020	m543	LEX	Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
L559127	u8020	m543	LEX	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
L559126	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
L559125	u8020	m543	LEX	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
L559124	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
L559123	u8020	m543	LEX	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
L559122	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
L559121	u8020	m543	LEX	Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
L560716	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
L560715	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Me?
L560712	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Got it? Otis?
L560711	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
L560710	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	One of them should've been you.
L560709	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
L560707	u8025	m544	ALBERT	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
L560706	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Albert!
L560705	u8025	m544	ALBERT	It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
L560675	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
L560674	u8025	m544	ALBERT	But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
L560669	u8025	m544	ALBERT	We're running out of smoke.
L560668	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
L560630	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
L560629	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Thank you.
L560628	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're a great architect, Albert.
L560627	u8025	m544	ALBERT	He's thirty-five years old.
L560626	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
L560397	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Shut up, apple-polisher.
L560396	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Nobody else.
L560395	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
L560392	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
L560391	u8025	m544	ALBERT	There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
L560350	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
L560349	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Bunkers!
L560348	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
L560344	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
L560343	u8025	m544	ALBERT	I know, but  --
L560700	u8029	m544	JIMMY	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
L560699	u8026	m544	CLARK	What's she doing in California?
L560698	u8029	m544	JIMMY	She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
L560697	u8026	m544	CLARK	Lois isn't here?
L560696	u8029	m544	JIMMY	You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
L560695	u8026	m544	CLARK	It was hot, yes.
L560694	u8029	m544	JIMMY	A hot story, huh?
L560693	u8026	m544	CLARK	I've been on the job.
L560692	u8029	m544	JIMMY	You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
L560238	u8026	m544	CLARK	I will.
L560237	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Keep warm now.
L560236	u8026	m544	CLARK	North. It's north
L560235	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Do you know where you're headed?
L560231	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know son, I know...
L560230	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mother...
L560229	u8035	m544	MARTHA	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
L560228	u8026	m544	CLARK	I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
L560225	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know.
L560224	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mom...
L560217	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
L560216	u8026	m544	CLARK	Don't worry, Mom. I know.
L560211	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
L560210	u8026	m544	CLARK	No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
L560209	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
L560562	u8033	m544	LOIS	Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
L560561	u8026	m544	CLARK	You're not the only one.
L560560	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
L560530	u8026	m544	CLARK	No thanks.
L560529	u8033	m544	LOIS	It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
L560528	u8026	m544	CLARK	Super...man. Hmmm...
L560527	u8033	m544	LOIS	They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
L560526	u8026	m544	CLARK	Is that what they're calling him?
L560525	u8033	m544	LOIS	Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
L560524	u8026	m544	CLARK	What'd you call him?
L560523	u8033	m544	LOIS	Of this...Superman.
L560522	u8026	m544	CLARK	Jealous? Of what?
L560521	u8033	m544	LOIS	You're just jealous.
L560520	u8026	m544	CLARK	I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
L560519	u8033	m544	LOIS	Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
L560518	u8026	m544	CLARK	Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
L560517	u8033	m544	LOIS	He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
L560516	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
L560515	u8033	m544	LOIS	There weren't any wires. I looked.
L560514	u8026	m544	CLARK	It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
L560513	u8033	m544	LOIS	Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
L560512	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
L560511	u8033	m544	LOIS	It wasn't a trick!
L560510	u8026	m544	CLARK	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
L560509	u8033	m544	LOIS	I'm telling you, I was there.
L560426	u8026	m544	CLARK	Come again?
L560425	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not unless you can fly.
L560424	u8026	m544	CLARK	Can I take you to the airport?
L560422	u8026	m544	CLARK	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
L560421	u8033	m544	LOIS	There's no real proof that tobacco  --
L560420	u8026	m544	CLARK	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
L560419	u8033	m544	LOIS	For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
L560418	u8026	m544	CLARK	Don't you ever give up?
L560417	u8033	m544	LOIS	It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
L560416	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh.
L560415	u8033	m544	LOIS	Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
L560414	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
L560413	u8033	m544	LOIS	Big night coming up?
L560412	u8026	m544	CLARK	Huh?
L560411	u8033	m544	LOIS	What now, my love?
L560336	u8026	m544	CLARK	I just took a shot at it.
L560335	u8033	m544	LOIS	You described the exact contents of my purse.
L560334	u8026	m544	CLARK	Know what?
L560332	u8026	m544	CLARK	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
L560331	u8033	m544	LOIS	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
L560330	u8026	m544	CLARK	It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
L560328	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, for God's sake!
L560327	u8026	m544	CLARK	He may have a gun!
L560326	u8033	m544	LOIS	Stop him, Clark!
L560325	u8026	m544	CLARK	What the  --  !
L560324	u8033	m544	LOIS	Hey!
L560323	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
L560322	u8026	m544	CLARK	Unbelievable.
L560321	u8033	m544	LOIS	See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
L560303	u8033	m544	LOIS	'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
L560302	u8026	m544	CLARK	But otherwise it's swell.
L560301	u8033	m544	LOIS	Some people aren't the athletic type.
L560300	u8026	m544	CLARK	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
L560299	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
L560298	u8026	m544	CLARK	Not really, no.
L560297	u8033	m544	LOIS	Are there any more at home like you?
L560296	u8026	m544	CLARK	Not really, no.
L560295	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not...gray.
L560294	u8026	m544	CLARK	Actually, she's silver-haired.
L560293	u8033	m544	LOIS	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
L560292	u8026	m544	CLARK	No.
L560291	u8033	m544	LOIS	Your bookie?
L560279	u8033	m544	LOIS	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
L560278	u8026	m544	CLARK	I'll bet you have some good ideas.
L560275	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well!
L560274	u8026	m544	CLARK	I'd like to.
L560789	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Okay.  Take me to your leader.
L560788	u8027	m544	EVE	What can I tell you? He's my leader.
L560787	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
L560786	u8027	m544	EVE	Oh.
L560785	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
L560784	u8027	m544	EVE	Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
L560783	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I'd better get you down.
L560782	u8027	m544	EVE	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
L560781	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
L560780	u8027	m544	EVE	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
L560779	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Besides that.
L560778	u8027	m544	EVE	Screaming
L560777	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What are you doing here?
L560776	u8027	m544	EVE	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
L560775	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
L560689	u8027	m544	EVE	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
L560688	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Listen...thank you.
L560771	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Of course I can. I love you.
L560770	u8027	m544	EVE	You can't do this to me!
L560769	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What other one?
L560768	u8027	m544	EVE	I mean the other one!
L560767	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I'm wearing it.
L560766	u8027	m544	EVE	Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
L560765	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
L560764	u8027	m544	EVE	Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
L560763	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Lex is going bye-bye.
L560762	u8027	m544	EVE	Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
L560761	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
L560760	u8027	m544	EVE	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
L560759	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You got wax in your ears?
L560758	u8027	m544	EVE	Tea?
L560757	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
L560756	u8027	m544	EVE	What are you going to do to him?
L560755	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
L560754	u8027	m544	EVE	Oh. Why? does he live up here?
L560753	u8027	m544	EVE	I didn't bring any  --
L560752	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
L560751	u8027	m544	EVE	This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
L560750	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
L560749	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't understand.
L560748	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
L560747	u8027	m544	EVE	A night on the town instead of under it?
L560746	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
L560745	u8027	m544	EVE	I know...
L560744	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
L560742	u8027	m544	EVE	I knew you'd hit me.
L560741	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
L560740	u8027	m544	EVE	You're not going to hit me?
L560739	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
L560738	u8027	m544	EVE	There was a recipe on the back  --
L560737	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No news is not good news. Y'know
L560733	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
L560732	u8027	m544	EVE	You?! How about me?
L560731	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Don't let me down.
L560728	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nothing.
L560727	u8027	m544	EVE	But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
L560726	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	They stop for nothing.
L560724	u8027	m544	EVE	Ready.
L560723	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ready?
L560722	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
L560721	u8027	m544	EVE	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
L560720	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
L560719	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
L560718	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
L560665	u8027	m544	EVE	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
L560664	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What do you suggest, my dear?
L560663	u8027	m544	EVE	We just take it?
L560662	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
L560661	u8027	m544	EVE	You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
L560660	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	La de da da...
L560659	u8027	m544	EVE	You're happy, aren't you?
L560648	u8027	m544	EVE	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
L560647	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
L560639	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No, you're going to get kissed,
L560638	u8027	m544	EVE	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
L560637	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
L560636	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
L560635	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	"Ahh. 'National Geographic."" In my day, this made 'Playboy"" look like Mother Goose."
L560633	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Bingo!
L560632	u8027	m544	EVE	Meteorites!
L560625	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
L560624	u8027	m544	EVE	Mr. Romance...
L560623	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
L560622	u8027	m544	EVE	I'm going to bed.
L560621	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
L560620	u8027	m544	EVE	See?
L560618	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
L560617	u8027	m544	EVE	I read the article.
L560616	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
L560615	u8027	m544	EVE	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
L560614	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Krypton!
L560553	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
L560552	u8027	m544	EVE	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
L560551	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What's the temperature now?
L560550	u8027	m544	EVE	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
L560549	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Damn!  This will get him.
L560548	u8027	m544	EVE	I didn't say a word.
L560547	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Shut up.
L560546	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're on.
L560545	u8027	m544	EVE	Bet he makes it.
L560544	u8027	m544	EVE	Tough guy, huh?
L560543	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nuts. He made it.
L560503	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	He's from another world.
L560502	u8027	m544	EVE	You think he's for real?
L560501	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
L560394	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	First the pets, Otis.
L560393	u8027	m544	EVE	Again???
L560390	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
L560389	u8027	m544	EVE	Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
L560365	u8027	m544	EVE	Even that would be an improvement.
L560364	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
L560363	u8027	m544	EVE	Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
L560362	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
L560361	u8027	m544	EVE	So I've noticed.
L560360	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
L560359	u8027	m544	EVE	This??
L560358	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
L560357	u8027	m544	EVE	Your father was a sick weirdo.
L560356	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	"My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."""
L560355	u8027	m544	EVE	Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
L560354	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
L560353	u8027	m544	EVE	It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
L560352	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
L560351	u8027	m544	EVE	You and your real estate.
L560127	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
L560126	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
L560123	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
L560122	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
L560117	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	And if I don't obey?
L560116	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
L560115	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
L560108	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	But so is Vond-El
L560107	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Then -
L560106	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
L560104	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
L560103	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
L560271	u8029	m544	JIMMY	On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
L560270	u8033	m544	LOIS	Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
L560268	u8033	m544	LOIS	It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
L560267	u8029	m544	JIMMY	How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
L560266	u8033	m544	LOIS	Gets you where you live, huh?
L560265	u8029	m544	JIMMY	Boy!
L560263	u8033	m544	LOIS	'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
L560262	u8029	m544	JIMMY	Two.
L560261	u8033	m544	LOIS	"an Ode to Spring. are there one or two ""T's"" in bloodletting?"
L560260	u8029	m544	JIMMY	What're you writing, Lois?
L560215	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
L560214	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
L560213	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
L560191	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
L560190	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
L560181	u8035	m544	MARTHA	We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
L560180	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
L560179	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
L560178	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
L560177	u8035	m544	MARTHA	We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
L560176	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Folks'll ask question.
L560175	u8035	m544	MARTHA	All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
L560174	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	He sure as heck does that.
L560173	u8035	m544	MARTHA	The good lord works in mysterious ways.
L560172	u8035	m544	MARTHA	All of us.
L560171	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
L560169	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
L560168	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	What's your name, boy?
L560167	u8035	m544	MARTHA	It's a ...baby.
L560152	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
L560151	u8032	m544	LARA	I want to know what my child is going to face.
L560150	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	You've been doing some research in the archives.
L560138	u8032	m544	LARA	He will be odd, different.
L560137	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
L560136	u8032	m544	LARA	He'll be weightless.
L560135	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
L560134	u8032	m544	LARA	A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
L560133	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
L560132	u8032	m544	LARA	But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
L560131	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Lara, please...
L560130	u8032	m544	LARA	-- as we will be.
L560129	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
L560495	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
L560494	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	There are none of them any good anyway.
L560493	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
L560492	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Twenty-four.
L560491	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
L560490	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	How good it felt -
L560489	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	How good it felt!
L560488	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	No! You couldn't imagine -
L560487	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
L560486	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I guess I got carried away
L560485	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Enjoyed it?
L560484	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
L560559	u8037	m544	PERRY	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
L560558	u8033	m544	LOIS	He is. Usually.
L560557	u8037	m544	PERRY	If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
L560409	u8037	m544	PERRY	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
L560408	u8033	m544	LOIS	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
L560407	u8037	m544	PERRY	Lois, the kickback story...
L560285	u8033	m544	LOIS	Okay, but...why?  No offense.
L560284	u8037	m544	PERRY	Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
L560273	u8037	m544	PERRY	It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
L560272	u8033	m544	LOIS	Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
L560613	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
L560612	u8033	m544	LOIS	Where do you hail from?
L560611	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Very much.
L560610	u8033	m544	LOIS	Do you like pink?
L560609	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure.
L560608	u8033	m544	LOIS	Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
L560607	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Pink.
L560606	u8033	m544	LOIS	What color underwear am I wearing?
L560605	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Only when somebody shoots them at me.
L560604	u8033	m544	LOIS	Do bullets really bounce off you?
L560603	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
L560602	u8033	m544	LOIS	Is it true you're impervious to pain?
L560601	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Uh-huh.
L560600	u8033	m544	LOIS	Can you really see through anything?
L560599	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What about it?
L560598	u8033	m544	LOIS	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
L560597	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	195 pounds.
L560596	u8033	m544	LOIS	How much do you weigh?
L560595	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Thirty-five.
L560594	u8033	m544	LOIS	How old are you?
L560593	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It's not bad.
L560592	u8033	m544	LOIS	It must feel great.
L560591	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
L560590	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh.
L560589	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
L560588	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
L560587	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I guess they are a little odd.
L560586	u8033	m544	LOIS	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
L560585	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	You think they're strange?
L560584	u8033	m544	LOIS	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
L560583	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Ask, You're the girl reporter.
L560582	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh.  Well, where do we start?
L560581	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
L560580	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
L560578	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
L560577	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
L560576	u8033	m544	LOIS	If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
L560575	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
L560574	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well...flashlight?
L560572	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
L560571	u8033	m544	LOIS	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
L560570	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
L560569	u8033	m544	LOIS	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
L560568	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I came to talk to you.
L560567	u8033	m544	LOIS	Wha'...what are you doing here?
L560566	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Right on the first guess.
L560565	u8033	m544	LOIS	Superman???
L560564	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
L560563	u8033	m544	LOIS	With my luck, now it'll rain.
L560446	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
L560445	u8033	m544	LOIS	Who...who...
L560444	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
L560443	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, God! I'm going to die!
L560442	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Do as I say. Let go!
L560441	u8033	m544	LOIS	You've got me? Who's got you???
L560440	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Easy now, miss, I've got you???
L560714	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
L560713	u8036	m544	OTIS	Sort of.
L560704	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
L560703	u8036	m544	OTIS	I still don't get it.
L560654	u8036	m544	OTIS	Oh, Mr. Luthor...
L560653	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
L560652	u8036	m544	OTIS	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
L560651	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
L560650	u8036	m544	OTIS	It's a Twinkie, boss.
L560649	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
L560643	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
L560642	u8036	m544	OTIS	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
L560641	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
L560506	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
L560505	u8036	m544	OTIS	It is for me.
L560504	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Is that real enough for you?
L560402	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otis...
L560401	u8036	m544	OTIS	Please...
L560387	u8036	m544	OTIS	I guess I...uh...regressed.
L560386	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
L560385	u8036	m544	OTIS	I...uh...check.
L560384	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I gave him this new face.
L560383	u8036	m544	OTIS	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
L560382	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I gave him steady employment --
L560381	u8036	m544	OTIS	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
L560380	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I broke the man out of prison --
L560379	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
L560378	u8036	m544	OTIS	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
L560377	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What's the matter, Otis?
L560376	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
L560375	u8036	m544	OTIS	Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
L560374	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
L560373	u8036	m544	OTIS	There.
L560372	u8036	m544	OTIS	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
L560371	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
L560346	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
L560345	u8036	m544	OTIS	I...uh...
L560842	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	We'll see how fast I can fly.
L560841	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
L560838	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
L560837	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
L560833	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
L560832	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	They'll soon be over.
L560831	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
L560830	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
L560829	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Luthor  --
L560827	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And garbage doors.
L560826	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	On radio waves?
L560825	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
L560821	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
L560820	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
L560819	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
L560818	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
L560817	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Maybe I should get help.
L560816	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
L560815	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
L560814	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
L560813	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
L560812	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
L560811	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
L560810	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
L560809	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Of time, Luthor.
L560808	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
L560807	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
L560806	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
L560805	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
L560795	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
L560794	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
L560793	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
L560672	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	But...why?
L560671	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
L560670	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What is this??!
L567649	u8071	m547	DYSON	That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
L567648	u8076	m547	TARISSA	But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
L567552	u8076	m547	TARISSA	Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
L567551	u8071	m547	DYSON	Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
L567550	u8071	m547	DYSON	I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
L567549	u8076	m547	TARISSA	I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
L567548	u8071	m547	DYSON	Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
L567547	u8071	m547	DYSON	Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
L567546	u8076	m547	TARISSA	Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
L567545	u8071	m547	DYSON	I can't
L567544	u8076	m547	TARISSA	You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
L567543	u8071	m547	DYSON	... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
L567542	u8071	m547	DYSON	I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
L567541	u8076	m547	TARISSA	You going to work all day?
L567681	u8074	m547	SARAH	NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
L567680	u8071	m547	DYSON	We should abort.
L567662	u8071	m547	DYSON	I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
L567661	u8074	m547	SARAH	Those lying motherfuckers!
L567660	u8071	m547	DYSON	They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
L567657	u8071	m547	DYSON	They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
L567656	u8074	m547	SARAH	What chip?
L567655	u8071	m547	DYSON	Do you know about the chip?
L567629	u8074	m547	SARAH	Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
L567628	u8071	m547	DYSON	Please... let... the kids... go...
L567685	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Let me try mine.
L567684	u8071	m547	DYSON	No good.
L567653	u8071	m547	DYSON	Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
L567652	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No one must follow your work.
L567651	u8071	m547	DYSON	Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
L567642	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Now listen to me very carefully.
L567641	u8071	m547	DYSON	My God.
L567638	u8071	m547	DYSON	In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
L567637	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Do you have bandages?
L567759	u8072	m547	JOHN	I order you not to!
L567758	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	It must end here... or I am the future.
L567757	u8072	m547	JOHN	Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
L567756	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I have to go away, John.
L567755	u8072	m547	JOHN	No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
L567754	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I'm sorry, John.
L567753	u8072	m547	JOHN	No!
L567748	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Yes.  Throw it in.
L567747	u8072	m547	JOHN	Will it melt in there?
L567746	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Terminated.
L567745	u8072	m547	JOHN	Is it dead?
L567732	u8072	m547	JOHN	What?
L567731	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	We don't have much time.
L567727	u8072	m547	JOHN	Where you going?!
L567726	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Drive for a minute.
L567701	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Trust me.
L567700	u8072	m547	JOHN	Remember what I said, you can't...
L567699	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I'll deal with the police.
L567616	u8072	m547	JOHN	I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
L567615	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
L567614	u8072	m547	JOHN	I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
L567613	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
L567612	u8072	m547	JOHN	Drive faster.
L567611	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	This is tactically dangerous.
L567609	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
L567608	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Dyson.
L567607	u8072	m547	JOHN	I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
L567606	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	She intends to change the future somehow.
L567605	u8072	m547	JOHN	"No fate.  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes ""The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."""
L567598	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No problemo.
L567597	u8072	m547	JOHN	Alriight!!  My man!
L567596	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.
L567595	u8072	m547	JOHN	Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
L567594	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Pain causes it?
L567593	u8072	m547	JOHN	You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
L567592	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Why do you cry?
L567591	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
L567590	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	You will.
L567589	u8072	m547	JOHN	Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
L567588	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Torque wrench please.
L567584	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
L567583	u8072	m547	JOHN	You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
L567582	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.
L567581	u8072	m547	JOHN	Not even of dying?
L567573	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
L567572	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Excellent.
L567524	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
L567523	u8072	m547	JOHN	We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
L567514	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
L567513	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Smile?
L567512	u8072	m547	JOHN	And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
L567507	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No problemo.
L567506	u8072	m547	JOHN	That's great!  See, you're getting it.
L567505	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Chill out, dickwad.
L567504	u8072	m547	JOHN	"Yeah, or ""later, dickwad.""  Or if someone gets upset you say ""chill out.""  Like that.  Or you can do combinations."
L567503	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Hasta la vista, baby?
L567502	u8072	m547	JOHN	"It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say ""eat me""... if you wanna shine them on, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby""."
L567501	u8072	m547	JOHN	"No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like ""Affirmative"" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo."
L567500	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Affirmative.
L567476	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
L567475	u8072	m547	JOHN	How long do you live?  I mean, last?
L567472	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
L567471	u8072	m547	JOHN	Does it hurt?
L567451	u8072	m547	JOHN	Cool.
L567450	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Everything.
L567426	u8072	m547	JOHN	"Just say ""I swear I won't kill anyone."""
L567425	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	What?
L567424	u8072	m547	JOHN	Swear.
L567423	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Right.
L567422	u8072	m547	JOHN	Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
L567402	u8072	m547	JOHN	You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
L567401	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Why?
L567400	u8072	m547	JOHN	Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
L567399	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Why?
L567398	u8072	m547	JOHN	Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
L567397	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
L567396	u8072	m547	JOHN	Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
L567387	u8072	m547	JOHN	Prove it... stand on one foot.
L567386	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	That is one of my mission parameters.
L567385	u8072	m547	JOHN	You have to do what I say?!
L567384	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	You told me to.
L567383	u8072	m547	JOHN	Oww!  Why'd you do that?
L567379	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
L567378	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
L567377	u8072	m547	JOHN	TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
L567376	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
L567375	u8072	m547	JOHN	Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
L567374	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
L567373	u8072	m547	JOHN	We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
L567372	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
L567371	u8072	m547	JOHN	Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
L567370	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.  Only an object of equal size.
L567369	u8072	m547	JOHN	Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
L567368	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Anything it samples by physical contact.
L567367	u8072	m547	JOHN	I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
L567363	u8072	m547	JOHN	Max.
L567362	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
L567353	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I would.
L567352	u8072	m547	JOHN	You sure?
L567351	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
L567350	u8072	m547	JOHN	Can I stop by my house?
L567349	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
L567348	u8072	m547	JOHN	Where we going?
L567347	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
L567346	u8072	m547	JOHN	Radical.
L567345	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Liquid metal.
L567344	u8072	m547	JOHN	What does that mean?
L567343	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
L567342	u8072	m547	JOHN	So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
L567340	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
L567339	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah?  Who sent you?
L567338	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	My mission is to protect you.
L567337	u8072	m547	JOHN	This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
L567336	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
L567335	u8072	m547	JOHN	Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
L567334	u8072	m547	JOHN	No way!
L567333	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
L567332	u8072	m547	JOHN	Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
L567267	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
L567266	u8078	m547	TIM	No shit?
L567265	u8072	m547	JOHN	Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
L567264	u8078	m547	TIM	So she's pretty cool, huh?
L567261	u8078	m547	TIM	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
L567260	u8072	m547	JOHN	Easy money!
L567241	u8072	m547	JOHN	Gimme that Phillips right there.
L567240	u8078	m547	TIM	Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
L567743	u8072	m547	JOHN	SHOOT!!!!
L567742	u8074	m547	SARAH	John, get out of the way!!
L567705	u8074	m547	SARAH	Ready.
L567704	u8072	m547	JOHN	Ready to rock?
L567698	u8074	m547	SARAH	Go!  I'll finish here.
L567697	u8072	m547	JOHN	I got it.  Piece of cake.
L567647	u8072	m547	JOHN	Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
L567646	u8074	m547	SARAH	Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
L567635	u8072	m547	JOHN	I know, Mom.  I know.
L567634	u8074	m547	SARAH	I love you, John.  I always have.
L567633	u8072	m547	JOHN	It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
L567632	u8072	m547	JOHN	Uh huh.
L567631	u8074	m547	SARAH	I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
L567630	u8072	m547	JOHN	Mom?  You okay?
L567526	u8074	m547	SARAH	I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
L567525	u8072	m547	JOHN	Yeah.  Drag, huh?
L567493	u8072	m547	JOHN	Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
L567492	u8074	m547	SARAH	I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
L567491	u8072	m547	JOHN	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
L567490	u8074	m547	SARAH	We're better off by ourselves.
L567489	u8072	m547	JOHN	Alright, it!  We need it!
L567488	u8074	m547	SARAH	It, John.  Not him.  It.
L567487	u8072	m547	JOHN	No!  Don't kill him!
L567486	u8074	m547	SARAH	Out of the way, John!
L567291	u8073	m547	REESE	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
L567290	u8074	m547	SARAH	Kyle, don't go!
L567289	u8073	m547	REESE	Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
L567288	u8074	m547	SARAH	I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
L567287	u8073	m547	REESE	Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
L567286	u8074	m547	SARAH	I know!
L567285	u8073	m547	REESE	It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
L567284	u8074	m547	SARAH	They took him from me.
L567282	u8074	m547	SARAH	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
L567281	u8073	m547	REESE	I love you.  I always will.
L567279	u8074	m547	SARAH	Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
L567278	u8073	m547	REESE	I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
L567433	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	Open the goddamn door!
L567432	u8074	m547	SARAH	You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
L567420	u8074	m547	SARAH	There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
L567419	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	You broke my arm!
L567320	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
L567319	u8074	m547	SARAH	So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
L567311	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
L567310	u8074	m547	SARAH	If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
L567309	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
L567307	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
L567306	u8074	m547	SARAH	You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
L567305	u8075	m547	SILBERMAN	And what it that?
L567304	u8074	m547	SARAH	It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
L567762	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Yes.
L567761	u8074	m547	SARAH	Are you afraid?
L567751	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.  There is another chip.
L567750	u8074	m547	SARAH	It's finally over.
L567669	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
L567668	u8074	m547	SARAH	Is it safe for them here?
L567664	u8074	m547	SARAH	Can you get us in there, past security?
L567663	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I must be destroyed.
L567659	u8074	m547	SARAH	Son of a bitch, I knew it!
L567658	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	The CPU from the first terminator.
L567540	u8074	m547	SARAH	I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
L567539	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	I have detailed files.
L567538	u8074	m547	SARAH	Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
L567537	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
L567536	u8074	m547	SARAH	Why attack Russia?
L567535	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
L567534	u8074	m547	SARAH	And Skynet fights back.
L567533	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
L567532	u8074	m547	SARAH	Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
L567531	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
L567530	u8074	m547	SARAH	Then what?
L567529	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
L567528	u8074	m547	SARAH	Why him?
L567527	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
L567480	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	No.
L567479	u8074	m547	SARAH	Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
L567478	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	"My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to ""read-only"" when we are sent out alone."
L567470	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Correct.
L567469	u8074	m547	SARAH	I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
L567467	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	So do you.
L567466	u8074	m547	SARAH	You look like handmade shit.
L567464	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Unknown.
L567463	u8074	m547	SARAH	Can it be destroyed?
L567462	u8077	m547	TERMINATOR	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
L567461	u8074	m547	SARAH	This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
L567300	u8079	m547	VIDEO SARAH	You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
L567299	u8080	m547	VIDEO SILBERMAN	Relax now, Sarah --
L567298	u8079	m547	VIDEO SARAH	On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
L567297	u8080	m547	VIDEO SILBERMAN	I'm sure it feels very real to you --
L567296	u8079	m547	VIDEO SARAH	It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
L567293	u8080	m547	VIDEO SILBERMAN	Please continue...
L567292	u8079	m547	VIDEO SARAH	... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
L570816	u8096	m549	SARAH	I won't let the fat kid down.
L570815	u8091	m549	BREEN	Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
L570814	u8096	m549	SARAH	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
L570813	u8091	m549	BREEN	Can you handle it?
L570812	u8096	m549	SARAH	Alright!
L570811	u8091	m549	BREEN	Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
L570810	u8096	m549	SARAH	Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
L570809	u8091	m549	BREEN	The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
L570808	u8096	m549	SARAH	I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
L570807	u8091	m549	BREEN	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
L570806	u8096	m549	SARAH	Aren't I worth waiting for?
L570805	u8091	m549	BREEN	You're late.
L570804	u8096	m549	SARAH	Mission control to Chuck, come in...
L570803	u8091	m549	BREEN	Come to the office, please.
L570802	u8096	m549	SARAH	Yes, Chuck?
L570829	u8098	m549	TERMINATOR	Wrong.
L570828	u8092	m549	CLERK	You can't to that...
L570825	u8098	m549	TERMINATOR	All.
L570824	u8092	m549	CLERK	Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
L570823	u8092	m549	CLERK	You know your weapons, buddy.
L570822	u8098	m549	TERMINATOR	The Uzi 9 millimeter.
L570821	u8092	m549	CLERK	Just what you see, pal.
L570820	u8098	m549	TERMINATOR	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
L570819	u8092	m549	CLERK	Anything else?
L570925	u8093	m549	GINGER	We will, kiddo.
L570924	u8096	m549	SARAH	I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
L570920	u8093	m549	GINGER	That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
L570916	u8096	m549	SARAH	I thought you did.
L570915	u8093	m549	GINGER	Not lately.  Did you check messages?
L570901	u8093	m549	GINGER	Don't wear the beige one.
L570900	u8096	m549	SARAH	I hate the beige one.
L570899	u8093	m549	GINGER	Alright, the beige one.
L570898	u8096	m549	SARAH	You're a big help.
L570897	u8093	m549	GINGER	Great.
L570896	u8093	m549	GINGER	Great.
L570895	u8096	m549	SARAH	What do you think?
L570872	u8096	m549	SARAH	I'll do the same for you sometime.
L570871	u8093	m549	GINGER	That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
L570870	u8096	m549	SARAH	I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
L570856	u8096	m549	SARAH	What's it to ya?
L570855	u8094	m549	MR. MILLER	Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
L570854	u8096	m549	SARAH	Aha!  Is she young?
L570853	u8094	m549	MR. MILLER	That's none of your business.
L570852	u8096	m549	SARAH	You must have a girlfriend.
L570851	u8094	m549	MR. MILLER	What's it to ya?
L570850	u8096	m549	SARAH	I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
L571267	u8095	m549	REESE	Cover...our footsteps...
L571266	u8096	m549	SARAH	What are you doing?
L571265	u8096	m549	SARAH	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
L571264	u8095	m549	REESE	Sarah.
L571251	u8096	m549	SARAH	You're not supposed to.
L571250	u8095	m549	REESE	I don't think I like this.
L571249	u8096	m549	SARAH	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
L571248	u8095	m549	REESE	What are you doing?
L571247	u8095	m549	REESE	Ticklish?
L571246	u8096	m549	SARAH	I bet you're ticklish.
L571245	u8096	m549	SARAH	Kyle...
L571244	u8095	m549	REESE	I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
L571240	u8096	m549	SARAH	Oh, Kyle.
L571239	u8095	m549	REESE	It's better that way.
L571238	u8096	m549	SARAH	And so you feel nothing.
L571237	u8095	m549	REESE	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
L571236	u8096	m549	SARAH	So much pain.
L571234	u8095	m549	REESE	No.  Never.
L571233	u8096	m549	SARAH	A girl.  You know.
L571232	u8095	m549	REESE	Someone?
L571231	u8096	m549	SARAH	That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
L571230	u8095	m549	REESE	Good fighters.
L571229	u8096	m549	SARAH	Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
L571228	u8095	m549	REESE	No.  I'm not.
L571227	u8096	m549	SARAH	It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
L571226	u8095	m549	REESE	If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
L571225	u8096	m549	SARAH	Don't say that.
L571224	u8095	m549	REESE	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
L571223	u8096	m549	SARAH	He'll find us, won't he?
L571221	u8096	m549	SARAH	I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
L571220	u8095	m549	REESE	Not possible.
L571219	u8096	m549	SARAH	I want it to be over for you.
L571218	u8095	m549	REESE	My whole life has been combat.
L571217	u8096	m549	SARAH	I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
L571216	u8095	m549	REESE	Hot dogs?
L571215	u8096	m549	SARAH	I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
L571214	u8095	m549	REESE	That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
L571213	u8096	m549	SARAH	You must have had a fun child-
L571212	u8095	m549	REESE	Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
L571211	u8095	m549	REESE	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
L571210	u8096	m549	SARAH	What's that?
L571198	u8095	m549	REESE	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
L571197	u8096	m549	SARAH	I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
L571195	u8096	m549	SARAH	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
L571194	u8095	m549	REESE	Is this enough?
L571185	u8095	m549	REESE	I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
L571184	u8096	m549	SARAH	Kyle?
L571177	u8096	m549	SARAH	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
L571176	u8095	m549	REESE	Let's go.  Time to move out.
L571175	u8096	m549	SARAH	Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
L571174	u8095	m549	REESE	That's not my mission.
L571173	u8096	m549	SARAH	Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
L571172	u8095	m549	REESE	Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
L571171	u8096	m549	SARAH	Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
L571170	u8095	m549	REESE	That's the way it was told to me.
L571169	u8096	m549	SARAH	Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
L571168	u8095	m549	REESE	Molecular-memory.
L571167	u8096	m549	SARAH	Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
L571166	u8095	m549	REESE	What about it?
L571165	u8096	m549	SARAH	Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
L571163	u8095	m549	REESE	Why?
L571162	u8096	m549	SARAH	That's where we're going.
L571161	u8095	m549	REESE	What's that?
L571160	u8096	m549	SARAH	Thanks a lot.
L571155	u8096	m549	SARAH	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
L571154	u8095	m549	REESE	Bag some Z's?
L571138	u8096	m549	SARAH	About where you're from.
L571137	u8095	m549	REESE	About what?
L571136	u8096	m549	SARAH	Okay.  Talk some more.
L571135	u8095	m549	REESE	Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
L571134	u8096	m549	SARAH	You like it?  It's my first.
L571133	u8095	m549	REESE	Good field-dressing.
L571132	u8095	m549	REESE	"John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah""...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all."
L571131	u8096	m549	SARAH	Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
L571130	u8095	m549	REESE	You'll learn.
L571129	u8096	m549	SARAH	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
L571128	u8095	m549	REESE	Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
L571127	u8096	m549	SARAH	Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
L571126	u8095	m549	REESE	I'm sure.
L571124	u8095	m549	REESE	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
L571123	u8096	m549	SARAH	You volunteered?
L571122	u8095	m549	REESE	I volunteered.
L571121	u8096	m549	SARAH	Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
L571120	u8095	m549	REESE	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
L571119	u8096	m549	SARAH	Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
L571118	u8095	m549	REESE	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
L571117	u8096	m549	SARAH	What's he like?
L571115	u8096	m549	SARAH	Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
L571114	u8095	m549	REESE	What?
L571113	u8096	m549	SARAH	This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
L571110	u8096	m549	SARAH	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
L571109	u8095	m549	REESE	It's okay.  Forget it.
L571108	u8096	m549	SARAH	We gotta get you to a doctor.
L571106	u8096	m549	SARAH	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
L571105	u8095	m549	REESE	I caught one, back there.
L571103	u8095	m549	REESE	White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
L571102	u8096	m549	SARAH	Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
L571101	u8095	m549	REESE	Kyle.
L571100	u8096	m549	SARAH	Reese...you got a first name?
L571099	u8095	m549	REESE	Come here.
L571098	u8096	m549	SARAH	Freezing.
L571097	u8095	m549	REESE	You cold?
L571024	u8095	m549	REESE	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
L571023	u8096	m549	SARAH	The what?
L571022	u8095	m549	REESE	Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
L571021	u8095	m549	REESE	Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
L571020	u8096	m549	SARAH	I don't understand...
L571019	u8095	m549	REESE	--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
L571017	u8096	m549	SARAH	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
L571016	u8095	m549	REESE	There's so much...
L571011	u8095	m549	REESE	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
L571010	u8096	m549	SARAH	Just let me go.
L571007	u8095	m549	REESE	Right.
L571006	u8096	m549	SARAH	And you're from the future too?
L571005	u8095	m549	REESE	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
L571004	u8096	m549	SARAH	So, it's from the future, is that right?
L571003	u8095	m549	REESE	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
L571002	u8096	m549	SARAH	Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
L571001	u8095	m549	REESE	Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
L571000	u8096	m549	SARAH	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
L570999	u8095	m549	REESE	But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
L570987	u8095	m549	REESE	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
L570986	u8096	m549	SARAH	This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
L570982	u8095	m549	REESE	I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
L570981	u8096	m549	SARAH	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
L570980	u8095	m549	REESE	Do you understand?
L571068	u8095	m549	REESE	Who is in authority here?
L571067	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	I can help you...
L571066	u8095	m549	REESE	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
L571065	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	I'm afraid that's not up to me.
L571064	u8095	m549	REESE	You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
L571063	u8095	m549	REESE	Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
L571062	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	Why were the other two women killed?
L571060	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	Of course.
L571059	u8095	m549	REESE	Surrounded by living tissue.
L571058	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
L571057	u8095	m549	REESE	I didn't build the fucking thing.
L571056	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	Why?
L571055	u8095	m549	REESE	You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
L571052	u8095	m549	REESE	Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
L571051	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	Then how are you supposed to get back?
L571050	u8095	m549	REESE	...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
L571047	u8095	m549	REESE	Yes.
L571046	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
L571045	u8095	m549	REESE	SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
L571044	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	And who was the enemy?
L571040	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	The year 2027?
L571039	u8095	m549	REESE	With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
L571038	u8097	m549	SILBERMAN	So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
L571082	u8096	m549	SARAH	Okay.
L571081	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
L571080	u8096	m549	SARAH	I can't sleep.
L571079	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
L571034	u8096	m549	SARAH	I guess so.  You're a doctor?
L571033	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
L571031	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
L571030	u8096	m549	SARAH	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
L571029	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Here, drink some of this...
L570966	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
L570965	u8096	m549	SARAH	Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
L570964	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
L570963	u8096	m549	SARAH	...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
L571049	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Shut up.
L571048	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
L570976	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
L570975	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Go!  Go!  He's got her.
L570945	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Like shit, boss.
L570944	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
L570943	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
L570942	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
L570941	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
L570940	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Same shit.
L570937	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Call her again.
L570936	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	I just called.
L570935	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Call her.
L570934	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
L570933	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Send a unit.
L570932	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
L570931	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Did you reach the next girl yet?
L570930	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	I put a cigarette out in it.
L570929	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	I know.
L570928	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	That stuff's two hours cold.
L570912	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	I hate the weird ones.
L570911	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
L570910	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Here's her driver's license.
L570909	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
L570908	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
L570905	u8099	m549	TRAXLER	Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
L570904	u8100	m549	VUKOVICH	Give me the short version.
L580484	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	You're not FBI agents.
L580483	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Well, we're FBI agents.
L580482	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	We don't even know you.
L580481	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you better tell us.
L580478	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
L580477	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Not supposed to talk about it.
L580475	u8188	m556	2ND BOY	Yeah.
L580474	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Do you live around here?
L580219	u8197	m556	MULDER	Sorry. Don't have one.
L580218	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Why don't you go home to the old lady --
L580217	u8197	m556	MULDER	Does what?
L580216	u8189	m556	BARMAID	I think that about does it, Spooky.
L580215	u8197	m556	MULDER	"What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. ""Spooky,"" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time."
L580214	u8189	m556	BARMAID	What do you do?
L580213	u8189	m556	BARMAID	A woman?  Work.
L580212	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yup.
L580211	u8189	m556	BARMAID	Poopy day?
L580646	u8190	m556	BYERS	Me?
L580645	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need your clothes, Byers.
L580635	u8197	m556	MULDER	They took her --
L580634	u8190	m556	BYERS	You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
L580633	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
L580629	u8197	m556	MULDER	When was that?
L580628	u8190	m556	BYERS	They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
L580626	u8197	m556	MULDER	Penetration but not perforation.
L580625	u8190	m556	BYERS	You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
L580624	u8197	m556	MULDER	What am I doing here?
L580733	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
L580732	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No, they don't.
L580731	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
L580730	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What is it you find incredible?
L580557	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Agent Mulder.
L580556	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Working with?
L580555	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
L580554	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nothing completely conclusive --
L580553	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
L580552	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes. I know.
L580551	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
L580550	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
L580549	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
L580548	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yes.
L580547	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	You've been back to Dallas?
L580545	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Evidence of what?
L580544	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
L580543	u8191	m556	CASSIDY	Special Agent Scully --
L580287	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
L580286	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Of what?
L580285	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
L580284	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
L580283	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Incinerate it. Like the others.
L580282	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	And if it's unsuccessful?
L580281	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
L580280	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
L580279	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
L580278	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	How can this be?
L580277	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
L580276	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	This man's still alive.
L580275	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
L580274	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Brought on by what?
L580273	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
L580272	u8194	m556	DR. BRONSCHWEIG	Yes.
L580271	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	You've got something to show me.
L580449	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Kurtzweil, we think.
L580448	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who?
L580447	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
L580446	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Do they know?
L580445	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	There are complications.
L580444	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
L580428	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Into what?
L580427	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
L580417	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
L580416	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Who called this meeting?
L580413	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Is it an emergency?
L580412	u8192	m556	CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
L580411	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580331	u8197	m556	MULDER	No. Don't bother.
L580330	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
L580329	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
L580328	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You looking for him for some other reason?
L580327	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
L580326	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's that?
L580325	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
L580324	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	Looking for him for what?
L580323	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for him.
L580322	u8193	m556	DETECTIVE	You got some kind of business with him?
L580321	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
L580398	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Show you right on a map.
L580397	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
L580386	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	No. Just fossils, far as I know.
L580385	u8197	m556	MULDER	Have you examined them?
L580384	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
L580383	u8197	m556	MULDER	Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
L580382	u8195	m556	FIELD AGENT	We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
L580381	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
L580581	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
L580580	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
L580579	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
L580577	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
L580576	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I told you -- he and I were old friends --
L580575	u8197	m556	MULDER	You didn't know my father --
L580574	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I've been using you?!
L580573	u8197	m556	MULDER	You've been using me --
L580572	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
L580571	u8197	m556	MULDER	You told me you had answers.
L580569	u8197	m556	MULDER	Your guess?
L580568	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That would be my guess.
L580567	u8197	m556	MULDER	A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
L580566	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What do you think?
L580563	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did it look like?
L580562	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	-- You saw this experiment?
L580561	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm not sure. A virus --
L580560	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What?
L580559	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
L580558	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You found something?
L580363	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You can't.
L580362	u8197	m556	MULDER	How can I reach you?
L580361	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
L580360	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they tell me I'm paranoid.
L580359	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
L580358	u8197	m556	MULDER	Negotiating with whom?
L580357	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
L580356	u8197	m556	MULDER	A plague?
L580355	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
L580354	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'll know soon enough.
L580353	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
L580352	u8197	m556	MULDER	What killed those men?
L580351	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
L580350	u8197	m556	MULDER	What was it?
L580348	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
L580347	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
L580346	u8197	m556	MULDER	It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
L580345	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
L580344	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
L580343	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
L580342	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580341	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
L580340	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I don't either, but it sure sells books.
L580339	u8197	m556	MULDER	Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
L580338	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	You know my work?
L580337	u8197	m556	MULDER	You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
L580336	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
L580335	u8197	m556	MULDER	They want to discredit you -- for what?
L580334	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
L580333	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not according to the men in blue.
L580332	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
L580257	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Do you?
L580256	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're full of shit.
L580255	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	And one little boy.
L580254	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
L580253	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
L580252	u8197	m556	MULDER	Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
L580251	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	That's what I'm saying.
L580250	u8197	m556	MULDER	Before the bomb went off?
L580249	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Those people were already dead.
L580247	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
L580246	u8197	m556	MULDER	The Federal Building was too well guarded.
L580245	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
L580244	u8197	m556	MULDER	He just let it explode.
L580243	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
L580242	u8197	m556	MULDER	And what's that?
L580240	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
L580239	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
L580238	u8197	m556	MULDER	Who sent you?
L580237	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
L580236	u8197	m556	MULDER	You a reporter?
L580235	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
L580234	u8197	m556	MULDER	How'd you find me?
L580231	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Old friend of your father's.
L580230	u8197	m556	MULDER	I know the name. Why?
L580229	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
L580228	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Yeah, I did.
L580227	u8197	m556	MULDER	You follow me out here for a reason?
L580226	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
L580225	u8197	m556	MULDER	Do I know you?
L580224	u8196	m556	KURTZWEIL	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
L580223	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580717	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
L580716	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't go any farther.
L580714	u8197	m556	MULDER	You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
L580713	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are we?
L580712	u8197	m556	MULDER	We've got to keep moving.
L580710	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
L580709	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cold...
L580608	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
L580607	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully --
L580606	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No -- it's --
L580605	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
L580604	u8198	m556	SCULLY	...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
L580603	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
L580602	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully...
L580600	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think... something stung me.
L580599	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What happened?
L580597	u8197	m556	MULDER	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
L580596	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
L580594	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
L580593	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you on this, Scully --
L580592	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
L580591	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just like that --
L580590	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I have. I did. It's done.
L580589	u8197	m556	MULDER	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
L580588	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
L580587	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
L580586	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
L580585	u8197	m556	MULDER	You can't quit, Scully.
L580584	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
L580583	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
L580582	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What's wrong?
L580541	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know.
L580540	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where'd they go?
L580534	u8197	m556	MULDER	Come on!
L580533	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What are you doing?
L580532	u8197	m556	MULDER	Run.
L580531	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Yeah...?
L580530	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully....?
L580528	u8197	m556	MULDER	Maybe. Maybe not.
L580527	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
L580526	u8197	m556	MULDER	You hear that?
L580524	u8197	m556	MULDER	For the purpose of what?
L580523	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
L580522	u8197	m556	MULDER	Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
L580521	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
L580520	u8197	m556	MULDER	Very weird.
L580519	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is weird, Mulder.
L580518	u8197	m556	MULDER	I have no idea.
L580517	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you think it is?
L580516	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
L580515	u8197	m556	MULDER	Been where?
L580514	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
L580513	u8197	m556	MULDER	It may be extraterrestrial.
L580512	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580511	u8197	m556	MULDER	This virus -- it... 
L580510	u8198	m556	SCULLY	What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
L580509	u8197	m556	MULDER	Yeah, well they may this one.
L580508	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
L580507	u8197	m556	MULDER	That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
L580506	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- of what exactly?!
L580505	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
L580504	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
L580503	u8197	m556	MULDER	What?
L580502	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is great. This is fitting.
L580501	u8197	m556	MULDER	Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
L580499	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know why I think they went right.
L580498	u8197	m556	MULDER	You think they went left?
L580497	u8198	m556	SCULLY	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
L580496	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where would they be going?
L580495	u8198	m556	SCULLY	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
L580494	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are my choices?
L580493	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
L580492	u8197	m556	MULDER	And where are they going with it?
L580491	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know, Mulder.
L580490	u8197	m556	MULDER	Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
L580472	u8197	m556	MULDER	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
L580471	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All the equipment is brand new.
L580470	u8197	m556	MULDER	Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
L580469	u8198	m556	SCULLY	It looks pretty green for this climate.
L580468	u8197	m556	MULDER	This looks like new grass to you?
L580467	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
L580466	u8197	m556	MULDER	And you've never seen anything like that?
L580465	u8198	m556	SCULLY	The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
L580464	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
L580463	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
L580462	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
L580461	u8198	m556	SCULLY	He didn't mention a park.
L580394	u8198	m556	SCULLY	That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
L580393	u8197	m556	MULDER	How was it contracted?
L580392	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
L580391	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580390	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
L580389	u8197	m556	MULDER	You said you weren't coming?
L580378	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
L580377	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
L580376	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've got a hearing tomorrow --
L580375	u8197	m556	MULDER	I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
L580374	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder --
L580373	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
L580372	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know.
L580371	u8197	m556	MULDER	What kind of infection?
L580370	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Evidence of a massive infection.
L580369	u8197	m556	MULDER	What did you find?
L580368	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I can't really talk right now.
L580367	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you whispering?
L580319	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
L580318	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
L580317	u8197	m556	MULDER	I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
L580316	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
L580315	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'd been told as much.
L580314	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
L580313	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
L580312	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
L580311	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
L580310	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
L580309	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's like jelly.
L580304	u8198	m556	SCULLY	And you're looking for?
L580303	u8197	m556	MULDER	According to this tag.
L580302	u8198	m556	SCULLY	This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
L580270	u8197	m556	MULDER	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
L580269	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- what are you doing?
L580268	u8197	m556	MULDER	Get dressed, Scully.
L580267	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Go home, Mulder. It's late.
L580266	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is that what you'd like me to do?
L580265	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
L580264	u8197	m556	MULDER	What are you implying, Scully?
L580263	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
L580262	u8197	m556	MULDER	I was until about an hour ago.
L580261	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Are you drunk, Mulder?
L580260	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why not? It's three AM.
L580259	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No.
L580258	u8197	m556	MULDER	I wake you?
L580206	u8198	m556	SCULLY	There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
L580205	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're... quitting?
L580204	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
L580203	u8197	m556	MULDER	This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
L580202	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
L580201	u8197	m556	MULDER	They were the ones that put us together.
L580200	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
L580199	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why?
L580198	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
L580197	u8197	m556	MULDER	What? What are you talking about?
L580196	u8198	m556	SCULLY	They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
L580195	u8197	m556	MULDER	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
L580194	u8198	m556	SCULLY	All I told them was the truth.
L580193	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
L580164	u8198	m556	SCULLY	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
L580163	u8197	m556	MULDER	Something's not right...
L580148	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
L580147	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully?
L580140	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
L580139	u8197	m556	MULDER	...thirteen fifty six...
L580138	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
L580137	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
L580134	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Nice try, Mulder.
L580133	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, get somebody to open this door.
L580131	u8197	m556	MULDER	I'm in the vending room.
L580130	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Where are you, Mulder?
L580129	u8197	m556	MULDER	Scully, I found the bomb.
L580128	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Scully...
L580126	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Something sweet.
L580125	u8197	m556	MULDER	Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
L580124	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I just did. You're buying.
L580123	u8197	m556	MULDER	Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
L580122	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
L580121	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
L580120	u8197	m556	MULDER	No you didn't.
L580119	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Had you.
L580117	u8197	m556	MULDER	It's locked?
L580116	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Now what?
L580115	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
L580114	u8198	m556	SCULLY	You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
L580113	u8197	m556	MULDER	How's that?
L580112	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
L580110	u8197	m556	MULDER	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
L580109	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Jesus, Mulder...
L580108	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to playing a hunch?
L580107	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder...?
L580106	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
L580105	u8197	m556	MULDER	I think they have that covered.
L580104	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
L580103	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're looking for a bomb.
L580102	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
L580101	u8197	m556	MULDER	What's wrong, Scully?
L580100	u8198	m556	SCULLY	No. I haven't.
L580099	u8197	m556	MULDER	Did you find something?
L580098	u8198	m556	SCULLY	I'm on the roof.
L580097	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where are you, Scully?
L580096	u8198	m556	SCULLY	Mulder -- it's me --
L580300	u8197	m556	MULDER	Thank you.
L580299	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
L580297	u8197	m556	MULDER	They can patch you in through the switchboard.
L580296	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't have his number.
L580295	u8197	m556	MULDER	Well, call General McAddie.
L580294	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	I don't know anything about that.
L580293	u8197	m556	MULDER	General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
L580292	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	General McAddie's.
L580291	u8197	m556	MULDER	On whose orders?
L580290	u8202	m556	YOUNG NAVAL GUARD	That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
L580289	u8197	m556	MULDER	We're going to the morgue.
L580648	u8197	m556	MULDER	I've got to find Scully.
L580647	u8199	m556	SKINNER	What are you doing?
L580644	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I'm not taking any chances.
L580643	u8197	m556	MULDER	Are we being watched?
L580642	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I don't know.
L580641	u8197	m556	MULDER	How deep does this go?
L580640	u8199	m556	SKINNER	I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
L580639	u8197	m556	MULDER	Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
L580638	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
L580637	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?!
L580636	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder --
L580191	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
L580190	u8197	m556	MULDER	I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
L580189	u8199	m556	SKINNER	She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
L580188	u8197	m556	MULDER	-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
L580187	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
L580186	u8197	m556	MULDER	But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
L580185	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
L580184	u8197	m556	MULDER	And they want to blame us?
L580183	u8199	m556	SKINNER	You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
L580182	u8197	m556	MULDER	She was with me.
L580181	u8199	m556	SKINNER	-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
L580180	u8197	m556	MULDER	About what?
L580179	u8199	m556	SKINNER	Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
L580701	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My life is over.  Go.
L580700	u8197	m556	MULDER	What about you?
L580699	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
L580698	u8197	m556	MULDER	What alien environment?
L580697	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
L580696	u8197	m556	MULDER	How?
L580695	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
L580692	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Driver.
L580691	u8197	m556	MULDER	Let me out. Stop the car.
L580690	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
L580689	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where is he?
L580688	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
L580687	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580686	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
L580685	u8197	m556	MULDER	Why are you telling me this?
L580684	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
L580683	u8197	m556	MULDER	But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
L580682	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
L580681	u8197	m556	MULDER	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
L580680	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
L580679	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
L580678	u8197	m556	MULDER	What do you mean, walked?
L580677	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
L580676	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
L580675	u8197	m556	MULDER	This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
L580674	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
L580673	u8197	m556	MULDER	A virus?
L580672	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
L580671	u8197	m556	MULDER	You're lying.
L580670	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
L580669	u8197	m556	MULDER	What is it?
L580667	u8197	m556	MULDER	I want to know where Scully is.
L580666	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
L580665	u8197	m556	MULDER	About the conspiracy?
L580664	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
L580663	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Yes.
L580662	u8197	m556	MULDER	Is she alive?
L580661	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I have answers for you.
L580660	u8197	m556	MULDER	Where's Scully?
L580659	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	He's come and gone.
L580658	u8197	m556	MULDER	What happened to Kurtzweil?
L580657	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Mr. Mulder.
L580459	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
L580458	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	You need not kill a man to destroy him.
L580457	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
L580452	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	And Mulder?
L580451	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
L580450	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
L580443	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
L580442	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	Our vaccine may have no effect!
L580439	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
L580438	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
L580437	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
L580436	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
L580435	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
L580432	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
L580431	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
L580430	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	My god...
L580424	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
L580423	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	More concerns than that?
L580421	u8201	m556	WELL-MANICURED MAN	I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
L580420	u8200	m556	STRUGHOLD	We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
L582483	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give a kiss to Edward.
L582482	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	...give a kiss to Edward.
L582481	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
L582480	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
L582479	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know.
L582478	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I don't need them anymore...
L582477	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
L582401	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
L582400	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What's wrong?
L582399	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Damn him.
L582397	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Baked in a pie.
L582396	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four and twenty blackbirds...
L582395	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	...a pocketful of rye.
L582189	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What happened?
L582188	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Is it cold in here?
L582158	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  No.
L582157	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
L582149	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She said convincingly.
L582148	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'll be fine.
L582147	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
L582137	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	He needs to be turned over.
L582136	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Like a New Year's Day hangover.
L582135	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
L582134	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
L582088	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why did we stop?
L582087	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nothing.
L582086	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
L582085	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence.
L581964	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's my girl.
L581963	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
L581962	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
L581961	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.
L581960	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Don't bring it home in this.
L581959	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
L581958	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Yes mother.
L581957	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
L581956	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.
L581955	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
L581952	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L581951	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
L581950	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'd be there for him.
L581949	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
L581948	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I do it all the time!
L581947	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
L581946	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
L581945	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
L581944	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
L581943	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Shush.
L581942	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Miriam...
L581940	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want to find out.
L581939	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
L581938	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
L581936	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Someday you can.  We all believe that...
L581935	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
L581934	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She adores you.
L581932	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Lucien Baines?
L581931	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He hates me.
L581909	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
L581908	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581907	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
L581906	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Did we go sailing?
L581903	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
L581902	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of rye...
L581901	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence...
L582517	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  Thank you.
L582516	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No problem.
L582515	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thank you.
L582514	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I got it.
L582513	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	They're hungry.
L582511	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
L582510	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't matter...
L582509	u8208	m557	NOVAK	He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
L582508	u8208	m557	NOVAK	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
L582507	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's mine?
L582506	u8208	m557	NOVAK	So you say.
L582505	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
L582504	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Well look at that.
L582503	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Good for them.
L582502	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yep.  Eloped.
L582501	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I heard Julia and John got married.
L582500	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Absolutely.  Abigail...
L582499	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You sure about this?
L582498	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
L582497	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That went well.
L582372	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I can't leave him!
L582371	u8208	m557	NOVAK	COME ON!
L582365	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
L582364	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Where the hell are we?
L582359	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
L582358	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Little boy?!  That's him!
L582357	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
L582356	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Like hell ""wait."""
L582355	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Wait...
L582256	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L582255	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
L582240	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yes.  I am.
L582239	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You're sure of that?
L582238	u8208	m557	NOVAK	A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
L582235	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Tell me.
L582234	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What difference does it make...?
L582233	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened?
L582232	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened to Charles Gish?
L582231	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
L582230	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	If you believe that.
L582229	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Evil.
L582228	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Then what is he?
L582227	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse."""
L582226	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
L582225	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
L582224	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
L582223	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This is Stargher we're talking about?
L582222	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
L582221	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You think you can do this, don't you?
L582220	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
L582219	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about Julia?
L582218	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
L582217	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I did, yeah.
L582216	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
L582213	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
L582212	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're the shrink, you tell me.
L582211	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why'd you bring him here?
L582210	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
L582209	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What did you see?
L582208	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	With Stargher I saw things...
L582206	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That's what therapists are for, right?
L582205	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
L582204	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
L582203	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
L582202	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Peter, okay?
L582201	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Agent Novak?
L582200	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
L582199	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
L582198	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What then?
L582197	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't have much to do with science.
L582196	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
L582195	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"
L582194	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you think that's funny?
L582193	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
L582140	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I know him.
L582139	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You don't know the procedure.
L582138	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This man is deeply disturbed, he...
L582133	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How hard could it be...?
L582132	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I realize that...
L582131	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with."
L582107	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
L582106	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
L582105	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
L582104	u8208	m557	NOVAK	There's always a chance they'll confess.
L582102	u8208	m557	NOVAK	As far as I needed.
L582101	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	"What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was ""normal?""  Conscious.  How far would you go?"
L581896	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I bet we can fix it.
L581895	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581894	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Oh no... No you don't.
L581893	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock.
L581892	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Who says?
L581891	u8205	m557	EDWARD	's broken.
L581890	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What now?
L581884	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's beautiful...
L581883	u8205	m557	EDWARD	You liked him?
L582470	u8204	m557	COLE	I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
L582469	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're kidding me.
L582468	u8204	m557	COLE	Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
L582467	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Delano?
L582466	u8204	m557	COLE	Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
L582385	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That hoist, with the winch...
L582384	u8204	m557	COLE	Already there.
L582383	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need you to find something in the basement...
L582382	u8204	m557	COLE	Agent Cole.
L581973	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
L581972	u8204	m557	COLE	She the one from Santa Cruz?
L582417	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
L582416	u8206	m557	HENRY	Instead of going into his mind...
L582412	u8206	m557	HENRY	It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
L582411	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What's wrong?
L582410	u8206	m557	HENRY	She changed the codes.
L582252	u8206	m557	HENRY	I think that's the whole point.
L582251	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
L582185	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
L582184	u8206	m557	HENRY	That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
L582163	u8206	m557	HENRY	Initiating connection.
L582162	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Intravenous administration complete.
L582161	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."
L582160	u8206	m557	HENRY	Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
L582124	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
L582123	u8206	m557	HENRY	Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
L582493	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Completely unaware.
L582492	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about the cat?
L582491	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Awaiting his arrival.
L582490	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How's the patient.
L582489	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
L582488	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's a secret.
L582487	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
L582486	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're looking well.
L582485	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Dr. Kent.
L582484	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.
L582380	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
L582379	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Is she alright?
L582330	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I doubt that.
L582329	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
L582328	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
L582327	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582326	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about narcotics?
L582325	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582324	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Any psychiatric medication?
L582323	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Prevacid.  For my stomach.
L582322	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
L582321	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.
L582320	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nervous?
L582317	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582316	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
L582313	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.
L582312	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Into Stargher.  Inside...
L582311	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."
L582310	u8208	m557	NOVAK	When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
L582192	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I'll get her...
L582191	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine!
L582095	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
L582094	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about the legalities of this...?
L582091	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometime yesterday morning.
L582090	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	When did he lapse into the coma?
L582014	u8208	m557	NOVAK	It's his dog.
L582013	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
L582002	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
L582001	u8208	m557	NOVAK	The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
L581998	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Now.
L581997	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Now?
L581996	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need it.
L581995	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
L581994	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	So?
L581976	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
L581975	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Someone looking after her little girl?
L582394	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
L582393	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
L582392	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
L582390	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Considering where I've been...
L582389	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
L582244	u8208	m557	NOVAK	But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
L582243	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Next time, tell me, okay?
L582242	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Right here.
L582120	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
L582119	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea."""
L582118	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
L582117	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't have to.
L582116	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
L582115	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What else do we do?!
L582114	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You sure you want to go through with this?
L582078	u8208	m557	NOVAK	They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
L582077	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
L582043	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.  Can you get a man close?
L582042	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
L582041	u8208	m557	NOVAK	We proceed assuming she is.
L582031	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	"She remembers because it was her ""dream truck.""  Wanted one just like it."
L582030	u8208	m557	NOVAK	After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
L582012	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
L582011	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
L581988	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
L581987	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Here he is.
L581986	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
L581985	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How is she?
L612275	u8412	m571	1ST VOICE	No, Tetanty.
L612274	u8413	m571	2ND VOICE	Vocasity
L612273	u8412	m571	1ST VOICE	4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
L612272	u8412	m571	1ST VOICE	No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.

L612182	u8414	m571	LUH	I don't want to lose you.
L612181	u8419	m571	THX	I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?

L612178	u8419	m571	THX	What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
L612177	u8414	m571	LUH	On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
L612176	u8419	m571	THX	What?
L612175	u8414	m571	LUH	You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
L612174	u8419	m571	THX	You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
L612173	u8414	m571	LUH	No....I though  I'm afraid.
L612172	u8419	m571	THX	What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
L612171	u8414	m571	LUH	Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.

L612160	u8414	m571	LUH	I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
L612159	u8414	m571	LUH	What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
L612158	u8419	m571	THX	Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.

L612146	u8414	m571	LUH	Look,dirt!
L612145	u8419	m571	THX	I've never been under the table before.
L612094	u8414	m571	LUH	Don't be so sure.
L612093	u8419	m571	THX	I haven't done anything.
L612092	u8414	m571	LUH	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
L612091	u8419	m571	THX	Then why did you bring it up?
L612090	u8414	m571	LUH	No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
L612089	u8419	m571	THX	You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
L612088	u8414	m571	LUH	I have to... he's a G-34
L612087	u8419	m571	THX	Don't go.
L612086	u8414	m571	LUH	I don't know.
L612085	u8419	m571	THX	A shift change should come through the scheduling office.

L612082	u8414	m571	LUH	Now.
L612081	u8419	m571	THX	When?
L612080	u8414	m571	LUH	I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
L612079	u8419	m571	THX	What did you get?
L612044	u8414	m571	LUH	Eat your dinner.
L612043	u8419	m571	THX	You know I don't feel well.
L612042	u8414	m571	LUH	You've seen enough.

L612037	u8419	m571	THX	What's the matter with you?
L612036	u8414	m571	LUH	No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
L612035	u8414	m571	LUH	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
L612034	u8419	m571	THX	I'm not hungry.
L612449	u8416	m571	PTO	It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
L612448	u8415	m571	NIN	There goes another of your disciples.
L612420	u8416	m571	PTO	A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
L612419	u8415	m571	NIN	Good Lord!
L612416	u8416	m571	PTO	What?
L612415	u8415	m571	NIN	But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
L612326	u8415	m571	NIN	What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
L612325	u8416	m571	PTO	You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
L612320	u8415	m571	NIN	I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
L612319	u8416	m571	PTO	Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
L612469	u8415	m571	NIN	But you can't.  We must escape.
L612468	u8417	m571	SEN	THX and me.
L612467	u8415	m571	NIN	Who?  Who's leaving?
L612466	u8417	m571	SEN	We're leaving.
L612465	u8415	m571	NIN	What?
L612464	u8417	m571	SEN	We're leaving.
L612463	u8415	m571	NIN	What's going on....what are you doing?
L612411	u8415	m571	NIN	We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
L612410	u8417	m571	SEN	I thought you were through with it!
L612473	u8420	m571	TWA	Incredible!
L612472	u8415	m571	NIN	We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
L612446	u8420	m571	TWA	It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
L612445	u8415	m571	NIN	That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
L612401	u8420	m571	TWA	Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
L612400	u8415	m571	NIN	Wait!  I'll talk to him.
L612394	u8420	m571	TWA	I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
L612393	u8415	m571	NIN	He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
L612385	u8420	m571	TWA	Impossible!
L612384	u8415	m571	NIN	I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
L612444	u8420	m571	TWA	No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
L612443	u8416	m571	PTO	What?
L612442	u8420	m571	TWA	I've got it!  Astounding!
L612432	u8420	m571	TWA	On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
L612431	u8416	m571	PTO	Not very encouraging.
L612430	u8420	m571	TWA	Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
L612429	u8416	m571	PTO	Well?
L612399	u8416	m571	PTO	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
L612398	u8420	m571	TWA	How far did you go?  Was it cold?
L612388	u8420	m571	TWA	No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
L612387	u8416	m571	PTO	I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
L612481	u8419	m571	THX	Look!
L612480	u8417	m571	SEN	What?
L612461	u8417	m571	SEN	But you can't...you.

L612131	u8419	m571	THX	I don't feel well.
L612130	u8417	m571	SEN	I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
L612128	u8417	m571	SEN	Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
L612127	u8419	m571	THX	You're in violation.
L612126	u8417	m571	SEN	We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
L612125	u8419	m571	THX	I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
L612124	u8417	m571	SEN	It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.

L612113	u8419	m571	THX	Where is LUH?
L612112	u8417	m571	SEN	I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
L612638	u8419	m571	THX	I thought of something.....

L612134	u8419	m571	THX	...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
L612133	u8421	m571	VOICE	Yes...
L612132	u8419	m571	THX	....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...

L612071	u8419	m571	THX	My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
L612070	u8421	m571	VOICE	Yes.
L612069	u8419	m571	THX	I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
L612068	u8421	m571	VOICE	Yes
L612067	u8419	m571	THX	....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
L612066	u8421	m571	VOICE	Yes.
L624538	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It runs deep. Share it with me.
L624537	u8593	m583	BEING	My pain?
L624536	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I couldn't help but notice you pain.
L624528	u8593	m583	BEING	Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
L624527	u8604	m583	SYBOK	The ship....
L624526	u8593	m583	BEING	Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
L624525	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No, no, it's not possible.
L624517	u8593	m583	BEING	He doubts me.
L624516	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
L624512	u8593	m583	BEING	You doubt me?
L624511	u8604	m583	SYBOK	He has his doubts...
L624500	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It will be your chariot!
L624499	u8593	m583	BEING	Then I shall make use of this starship.
L624498	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It could. Yes.
L624497	u8593	m583	BEING	This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
L624496	u8604	m583	SYBOK	With a starship!
L624495	u8593	m583	BEING	And how did you breach the Barrier?
L624494	u8604	m583	SYBOK	We sought only your infinite wisdom.
L624493	u8593	m583	BEING	Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
L624492	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
L624491	u8593	m583	BEING	It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
L624490	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Qual se tu?
L623994	u8605	m583	UHURA	Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
L623993	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
L623992	u8605	m583	UHURA	My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
L623989	u8605	m583	UHURA	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
L623988	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
L623987	u8605	m583	UHURA	Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
L623986	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Rescued at last.
L623985	u8605	m583	UHURA	Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
L624541	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
L624540	u8603	m583	SULU	In firing position. Torpedo armed.
L624325	u8603	m583	SULU	Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
L624324	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Following new course. Warp seven.
L624309	u8603	m583	SULU	Pavel.
L624308	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
L624307	u8603	m583	SULU	Plotting our new course.
L624306	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Sulu, what are you doing?
L623991	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
L623990	u8603	m583	SULU	Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
L623982	u8603	m583	SULU	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
L623981	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Admit it. We're lost.
L624246	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	I don't have a clue.
L624245	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
L624226	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	DO it. Go to Red Alert.
L624225	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	But the shuttle-
L624224	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Raise shields.
L624223	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
L624219	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Closing.
L624218	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Position, Bird of Prey?
L624217	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Shuttle en route.
L624193	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
L624192	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
L624191	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What's going on?
L624171	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
L624170	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
L624169	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
L624166	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
L624165	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
L624164	u8604	m583	SYBOK	A Federation starship.
L624163	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is the Starship Enterprise.
L624097	u8598	m583	KIRK	Understood. Kirk out.
L624096	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	No, but you can bet they will.
L624095	u8598	m583	KIRK	Have the Klingons responded?
L624094	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
L624093	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, please.
L624092	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
L624091	u8598	m583	KIRK	With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
L624090	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
L624089	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
L624088	u8598	m583	KIRK	"On ""The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"""
L624087	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
L624086	u8598	m583	KIRK	You caught me on my way to the shower.
L624085	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
L624084	u8598	m583	KIRK	Bob?
L624083	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
L624082	u8598	m583	KIRK	Can we have it quiet?
L623924	u8600	m583	RIDER	Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
L623923	u8597	m583	J'ONN	But how?
L623922	u8600	m583	RIDER	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
L623921	u8597	m583	J'ONN	A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
L623920	u8600	m583	RIDER	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
L623919	u8597	m583	J'ONN	What is it you seek?
L623918	u8600	m583	RIDER	Join my quest.
L623917	u8597	m583	J'ONN	I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
L623916	u8600	m583	RIDER	The power was within you.
L623915	u8597	m583	J'ONN	Where did you get this power?
L623913	u8600	m583	RIDER	Let us explore it together.
L623912	u8597	m583	J'ONN	What do you know of my pain?
L623911	u8600	m583	RIDER	Your pain runs deep.
L623910	u8597	m583	J'ONN	It's all I have.
L623909	u8600	m583	RIDER	Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
L624553	u8598	m583	KIRK	Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
L624552	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
L624359	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
L624358	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
L624357	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
L624353	u8598	m583	KIRK	If we could send a distress signal...
L624352	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
L624154	u8598	m583	KIRK	Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
L624153	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
L624104	u8598	m583	KIRK	I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
L624103	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
L624068	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
L624067	u8598	m583	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
L624066	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
L624065	u8598	m583	KIRK	You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
L624258	u8598	m583	KIRK	Go, Sulu.
L624257	u8605	m583	UHURA	Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
L624152	u8598	m583	KIRK	Transporter room. Status.
L624151	u8605	m583	UHURA	Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
L624150	u8598	m583	KIRK	Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
L624149	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
L624148	u8598	m583	KIRK	Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
L624119	u8598	m583	KIRK	Put it on the screen.
L624118	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
L624076	u8598	m583	KIRK	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
L624075	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
L624056	u8605	m583	UHURA	ER... You forgot to take it with you.
L624055	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why didn't you beep my communicator?
L624054	u8605	m583	UHURA	Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
L624592	u8598	m583	KIRK	Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
L624591	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
L624590	u8598	m583	KIRK	Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
L624579	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Not possible. You were never alone.
L624578	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, I thought I was going to die.
L624577	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Captain.
L624576	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock?
L624432	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
L624431	u8598	m583	KIRK	What is this?
L624430	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
L624429	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock... don't.
L624383	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
L624382	u8602	m583	SPOCK	...mark two.
L624379	u8598	m583	KIRK	To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
L624378	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The emergency channel, open.
L624377	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock.
L624373	u8598	m583	KIRK	Fire the rockets!
L624372	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
L624371	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock... the booster rockets.
L624370	u8598	m583	KIRK	It must be all those marsh melons.
L624369	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It would appear we are too heavy.
L624366	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Uh-uh.
L624365	u8598	m583	KIRK	Hmmm?
L624364	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe I have found a faster way.
L624355	u8598	m583	KIRK	The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
L624354	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
L624348	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"c.... ""k."""
L624347	u8598	m583	KIRK	"New word. ""b"".. ""a""... um..."
L624346	u8598	m583	KIRK	"a... ""n""...uh, ""d""... end of word."
L624345	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"A ""t."""
L624344	u8598	m583	KIRK	"You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an ""s."""
L624341	u8598	m583	KIRK	That's a little vague, Spock -
L624340	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am here, Captain.
L624339	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
L624338	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
L624337	u8598	m583	KIRK	But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
L624336	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
L624332	u8602	m583	SPOCK	That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
L624331	u8598	m583	KIRK	Is what possible?
L624330	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Is it possible?
L624323	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He did have pointed ears.
L624322	u8598	m583	KIRK	This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
L624321	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
L624320	u8598	m583	KIRK	How do you know?
L624319	u8602	m583	SPOCK	This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
L624318	u8598	m583	KIRK	There's got to be a way out of this place.
L624302	u8598	m583	KIRK	He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
L624301	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
L624300	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why didn't you tell me this before?
L624299	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
L624298	u8598	m583	KIRK	I gotta sit down.
L624297	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I have a half brother.
L624296	u8598	m583	KIRK	There, you see? See?
L624295	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
L624294	u8598	m583	KIRK	You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
L624293	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I did not.
L624292	u8598	m583	KIRK	You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
L624291	u8602	m583	SPOCK	No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
L624290	u8598	m583	KIRK	Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
L624289	u8602	m583	SPOCK	You ordered me to kill my brother.
L624288	u8598	m583	KIRK	I ordered you to defend this ship.
L624287	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
L624286	u8598	m583	KIRK	You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
L624285	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If you think it would help.
L624284	u8598	m583	KIRK	Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
L624283	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
L624282	u8598	m583	KIRK	What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
L624281	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Captain, what have I done -
L624280	u8598	m583	KIRK	Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
L624239	u8598	m583	KIRK	Let me do something.
L624238	u8602	m583	SPOCK	You must allow us to act.
L624235	u8598	m583	KIRK	An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
L624234	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Exactly 15.5 seconds.
L624181	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain.
L624180	u8598	m583	KIRK	Be one with the horse.
L624179	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain?
L624178	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock.
L624173	u8598	m583	KIRK	We don't have 1.2 hours.
L624172	u8602	m583	SPOCK	At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
L624160	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Sulu. Execute.
L624159	u8602	m583	SPOCK	To land any closer would risk detection.
L624158	u8598	m583	KIRK	That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
L624157	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
L624156	u8598	m583	KIRK	Damn.  Let's go.
L624155	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
L624141	u8598	m583	KIRK	Fascinating.
L624140	u8602	m583	SPOCK	When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
L624139	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
L624138	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why?
L624137	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
L624136	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
L624135	u8598	m583	KIRK	What do you mean?
L624134	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
L624133	u8598	m583	KIRK	Who is it he reminds you of?
L624132	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I do not often think of the past.
L624131	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
L624130	u8598	m583	KIRK	But he does seem familiar?
L624129	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I cannot be certain.
L624128	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
L624127	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
L624126	u8598	m583	KIRK	What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
L624123	u8598	m583	KIRK	General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
L624122	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
L624121	u8598	m583	KIRK	Not General Korrd.
L624072	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes.
L624071	u8598	m583	KIRK	I could use a shower.
L624040	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Goodnight, Doctor.
L624039	u8598	m583	KIRK	Goodnight, Spock.
L624038	u8598	m583	KIRK	Goodnight, Bones.
L624037	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain.
L624036	u8598	m583	KIRK	Go to sleep, Spock.
L624035	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Life is not a dream.
L624034	u8598	m583	KIRK	Yes, Spock?
L624033	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Jim.
L624032	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
L624031	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Captain?
L624027	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
L624026	u8598	m583	KIRK	Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
L624025	u8598	m583	KIRK	"The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.."" The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please."
L624024	u8602	m583	SPOCK	That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
L624023	u8598	m583	KIRK	"Row, row, row your boat... I love ""Row...""  Do - do you know ""Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"""
L624021	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Are we leaving, Captain?
L624020	u8598	m583	KIRK	Pack Up Your Troubles.
L624019	u8598	m583	KIRK	That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
L624018	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
L624015	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
L624014	u8598	m583	KIRK	What are you doing?
L624012	u8598	m583	KIRK	I've always known... I'll die alone.
L624011	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I don't understand.
L624010	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
L623941	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"Perhaps ""because it is there"" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain."
L623940	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, God
L623939	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
L623938	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
L623937	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
L623936	u8598	m583	KIRK	On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
L623935	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
L623934	u8598	m583	KIRK	MM.?
L623933	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Ah, Captain?
L623932	u8598	m583	KIRK	Because it's there.
L623931	u8602	m583	SPOCK	And that is?
L623930	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
L623929	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
L623928	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
L623927	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
L624531	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock...
L624530	u8598	m583	KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
L624529	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What have I done?
L624475	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Because you, too, must know.
L624474	u8598	m583	KIRK	What makes you think I won't turn us around?
L624473	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No conditions.
L624472	u8598	m583	KIRK	No special conditions?
L624471	u8604	m583	SYBOK	The ship needs its Captain.
L624470	u8598	m583	KIRK	About the ship...
L624456	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Am I? We'll see.
L624455	u8598	m583	KIRK	You are mad!
L624454	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
L624453	u8598	m583	KIRK	Your vision?
L624452	u8604	m583	SYBOK	But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
L624451	u8598	m583	KIRK	Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
L624438	u8598	m583	KIRK	No. I refuse.
L624437	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Now learn something about yourself.
L624436	u8598	m583	KIRK	No... I didn't.
L624435	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
L624434	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
L624405	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't control minds. I free them.
L624404	u8598	m583	KIRK	The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
L624403	u8604	m583	SYBOK	"Sha Ka Ree. ""The Scource."" ""Heaven."" ""Eden."" call it ""Qui'Tu."" To the Romulans, it's ""Vorta Vor."" The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality."
L624392	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'm afraid of nothing.
L624391	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
L624390	u8598	m583	KIRK	You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
L624389	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I trust your message was received?
L624267	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'll take you to the bridge.
L624266	u8604	m583	SYBOK	We must change our course at once.
L624250	u8598	m583	KIRK	In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
L624249	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What are you doing?
L624233	u8598	m583	KIRK	Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
L624232	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No! No reply. Remain on course.
L624214	u8604	m583	SYBOK	But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
L624213	u8598	m583	KIRK	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
L624212	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Who are you?
L624211	u8598	m583	KIRK	You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
L624210	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I must have your starship.
L624053	u8599	m583	KLAA	  
L624402	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
L624401	u8605	m583	UHURA	No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
L624399	u8605	m583	UHURA	No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
L624398	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	He's not?
L624397	u8605	m583	UHURA	Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
L624396	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
L624395	u8605	m583	UHURA	Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
L623979	u8605	m583	UHURA	Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
L623978	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
L623969	u8605	m583	UHURA	I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
L623968	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
L623967	u8605	m583	UHURA	And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
L623966	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
L623965	u8605	m583	UHURA	I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
L623964	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Let's see what she's got, said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
L623963	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Borgus Frat.
L624535	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
L624534	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, we must find a way...
L624533	u8604	m583	SYBOK	This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
L624532	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok.
L624523	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
L624522	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
L624449	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
L624448	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't understand...
L624447	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I belong here.
L624446	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Why not?
L624445	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I cannot go with you.
L624444	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock?
L624428	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Do you?
L624427	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I know you better than that.
L624426	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I hide no pain.
L624425	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Each man's pain is unique.
L624275	u8604	m583	SYBOK	You know I'm right.
L624274	u8602	m583	SPOCK	No. I will not.
L624273	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
L624270	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No. You must kill me.
L624269	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, you must surrender.
L624216	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
L624215	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am a Starfleet Officer.
L624209	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
L624208	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
L624207	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
L625846	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
L625845	u8607	m584	ALAN	Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
L625837	u8607	m584	ALAN	Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
L625836	u8611	m584	FLYNN	And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
L625835	u8607	m584	ALAN	Your old files -- ?
L625833	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I know, I met him.
L625832	u8607	m584	ALAN	Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
L625456	u8607	m584	ALAN	Uh... got any cinnamon?
L625455	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Want one?
L625454	u8607	m584	ALAN	I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
L625453	u8611	m584	FLYNN	My dinner.
L625452	u8607	m584	ALAN	Hi, Flynn.
L625451	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hi, Alan.
L625435	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
L625434	u8607	m584	ALAN	Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
L625431	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
L625430	u8607	m584	ALAN	Dillinger?
L625426	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
L625425	u8607	m584	ALAN	I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
L625424	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
L625423	u8607	m584	ALAN	Senior exec.
L625422	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has ""invented"" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?"
L625421	u8607	m584	ALAN	You invented Space Paranoids?
L625420	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
L625419	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You haven't told him?
L625418	u8607	m584	ALAN	I don't get it.
L625417	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
L625416	u8607	m584	ALAN	Are you embezzling?
L625415	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
L625414	u8607	m584	ALAN	You did break in.
L625459	u8607	m584	ALAN	I'm certainly not.
L625458	u8613	m584	LORA	I don't think I'm cleared for this.
L625411	u8607	m584	ALAN	Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
L625410	u8613	m584	LORA	Flynn!
L625400	u8607	m584	ALAN	What -- ?
L625399	u8613	m584	LORA	For being on to Dillinger.
L625398	u8607	m584	ALAN	For what?
L625397	u8613	m584	LORA	That Dillinger's on to him.
L625396	u8607	m584	ALAN	Of what?
L625395	u8613	m584	LORA	To warn him.
L625394	u8607	m584	ALAN	What for?
L625393	u8613	m584	LORA	I mean I want both of us to go.
L625392	u8607	m584	ALAN	You call that getting over it?
L625391	u8613	m584	LORA	I want to go to his place.
L625390	u8607	m584	ALAN	Okay, okay...
L625389	u8613	m584	LORA	Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
L625388	u8607	m584	ALAN	Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
L625387	u8613	m584	LORA	Flynn had Group 7 access.
L625386	u8607	m584	ALAN	Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
L625385	u8613	m584	LORA	Did he say why?
L625384	u8607	m584	ALAN	Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
L625383	u8613	m584	LORA	Did you say Group 7 access?
L625378	u8607	m584	ALAN	Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
L625377	u8613	m584	LORA	How's it going upstairs?
L625382	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
L625381	u8607	m584	ALAN	They'll start to soon enough.
L625380	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
L625379	u8607	m584	ALAN	Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
L625376	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
L625375	u8607	m584	ALAN	Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
L625374	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
L625373	u8607	m584	ALAN	Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
L625372	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Hello, Alan.
L625371	u8607	m584	ALAN	Beautiful!
L625347	u8607	m584	ALAN	Ok
L625346	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
L625345	u8607	m584	ALAN	No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
L625344	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
L625343	u8607	m584	ALAN	It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
L625342	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
L625341	u8607	m584	ALAN	I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
L625340	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
L625339	u8607	m584	ALAN	Yeah...?
L625338	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
L625337	u8607	m584	ALAN	Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
L625336	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
L625335	u8607	m584	ALAN	Alan. Alan Bailey.
L625334	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Come on in...
L625780	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Let's get outta here.
L625779	u8608	m584	BIT	Yes!
L625719	u8611	m584	FLYNN	So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
L625718	u8608	m584	BIT	You said it.
L625643	u8608	m584	BIT	Not a chance.
L625642	u8611	m584	FLYNN	This town's full o' live ones.
L625637	u8608	m584	BIT	No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
L625636	u8611	m584	FLYNN	This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
L625615	u8608	m584	BIT	Yes, okay, exactement!
L625614	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Way to go! We're haulin'!
L625612	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
L625611	u8608	m584	BIT	Right on the money!
L625610	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I'm your program?
L625609	u8608	m584	BIT	No...
L625608	u8611	m584	FLYNN	where's your program? Won't it miss you?
L625607	u8608	m584	BIT	For sure...
L625606	u8611	m584	FLYNN	only yes and no...  You're a bit.
L625605	u8608	m584	BIT	Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
L625604	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh. Anything else?
L625603	u8608	m584	BIT	No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
L625602	u8611	m584	FLYNN	That all you can say?
L625601	u8608	m584	BIT	Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
L625600	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"What do you mean, ""'yes""?"
L625363	u8614	m584	MCP	So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
L625362	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	You wouldn't dare.
L625361	u8614	m584	MCP	You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
L625360	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	If you think -
L625359	u8614	m584	MCP	The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
L625358	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	What do you want with the Pentagon?
L625357	u8614	m584	MCP	I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
L625356	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
L625355	u8614	m584	MCP	It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
L625354	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	The Pentagon?
L625353	u8614	m584	MCP	And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
L625352	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
L625351	u8614	m584	MCP	I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
L625350	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I'm sorry -
L625349	u8614	m584	MCP	Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
L625330	u8614	m584	MCP	End of line.
L625329	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Cute.
L625328	u8614	m584	MCP	There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
L625327	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
L625326	u8614	m584	MCP	I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
L625325	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Meanwhile, he might find it.
L625324	u8614	m584	MCP	I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
L625323	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
L625322	u8614	m584	MCP	Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
L625321	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Flynn?
L625320	u8614	m584	MCP	It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
L625319	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
L625448	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
L625447	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
L625446	u8612	m584	GIBBS	That was uncalled-for.
L625445	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	It can be arranged...
L625444	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
L625442	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
L625441	u8612	m584	GIBBS	User requests are what computers are for.
L625440	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
L625439	u8612	m584	GIBBS	That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
L625438	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
L625437	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
L625811	u8610	m584	DUMONT	They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
L625810	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
L625809	u8610	m584	DUMONT	No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
L625808	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont!
L625659	u8610	m584	DUMONT	All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
L625658	u8617	m584	TRON	Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
L625657	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Who is your User, program?
L625656	u8610	m584	DUMONT	When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
L625655	u8617	m584	TRON	Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
L625654	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Hah.
L625653	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
L625652	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
L625651	u8617	m584	TRON	Well I want to communicate --
L625648	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
L625647	u8617	m584	TRON	I... have come to communicate with my User.
L625646	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Yes?
L625754	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
L625753	u8617	m584	TRON	How about you?
L625752	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey... you guys OK?
L625750	u8617	m584	TRON	Yes.
L625749	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Did we make it?
L625729	u8617	m584	TRON	Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
L625728	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Not us, I hope.
L625727	u8617	m584	TRON	Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
L625726	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What about our friend - Sark?
L625722	u8611	m584	FLYNN	All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
L625721	u8617	m584	TRON	We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
L625717	u8617	m584	TRON	Stranger and stranger...
L625716	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
L625715	u8617	m584	TRON	Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
L625714	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
L625713	u8617	m584	TRON	Then...
L625712	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
L625711	u8617	m584	TRON	But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
L625708	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
L625707	u8617	m584	TRON	Wrote the...?
L625706	u8611	m584	FLYNN	No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
L625703	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
L625702	u8617	m584	TRON	Flynn...  Where's Ram?
L625700	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, I... oops!
L625699	u8617	m584	TRON	You're alive!
L625698	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Greetings, program...
L625697	u8617	m584	TRON	Flynn!!
L625582	u8617	m584	TRON	No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
L625581	u8611	m584	FLYNN	How about over there...that empty memory?
L625580	u8617	m584	TRON	Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
L625579	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's that?
L625575	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
L625574	u8617	m584	TRON	What, just the three of us?
L625539	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
L625538	u8617	m584	TRON	The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
L625537	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Well, isn't it -- ?
L625536	u8617	m584	TRON	Where did you hear that name?
L625535	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Alan!
L625821	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Shhhhh.
L625820	u8618	m584	YORI	Flynn... you can't... I
L625819	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Probably.
L625818	u8618	m584	YORI	But... won't you be de-rezzed?
L625817	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Jump.
L625816	u8618	m584	YORI	Why? What are you going to do?
L625815	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
L625796	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Let's get some power here.
L625795	u8618	m584	YORI	Flynn, we've got to help him!
L625757	u8618	m584	YORI	Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
L625756	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
L625755	u8618	m584	YORI	How did you do that, Flynn?
L625746	u8618	m584	YORI	It's too far!
L625745	u8611	m584	FLYNN	There's another beam!
L625734	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
L625733	u8618	m584	YORI	The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
L625732	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's wrong with that area?
L625731	u8618	m584	YORI	A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
L625730	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
L625710	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
L625709	u8618	m584	YORI	A User -- in our world?
L625596	u8615	m584	RAM	Little more juice's all it needs...
L625595	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey... !
L625594	u8615	m584	RAM	Come here.
L625593	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
L625590	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
L625589	u8615	m584	RAM	We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
L625588	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's goin' on?
L625566	u8615	m584	RAM	Alan-One...
L625565	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Feel what? You okay?
L625563	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It grows on you.
L625562	u8615	m584	RAM	PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
L625561	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"Well...my home ""sector"" was called Paramus ..."
L625560	u8615	m584	RAM	The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
L625559	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
L625553	u8615	m584	RAM	Recognizers!
L625552	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Watch it!
L625541	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
L625540	u8615	m584	RAM	He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
L625534	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Tron...?
L625533	u8615	m584	RAM	Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
L625514	u8615	m584	RAM	Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
L625513	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
L625512	u8615	m584	RAM	How 'bout yourself?
L625511	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
L625510	u8615	m584	RAM	Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
L625509	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
L625502	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
L625501	u8615	m584	RAM	"You're a...""guest"" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games."
L625500	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
L625499	u8615	m584	RAM	You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
L625844	u8613	m584	LORA	You're getting out of the business?
L625843	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
L625841	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
L625840	u8613	m584	LORA	Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
L625839	u8611	m584	FLYNN	you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
L625463	u8613	m584	LORA	As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
L625462	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
L625461	u8613	m584	LORA	Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
L625433	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
L625432	u8613	m584	LORA	Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
L625429	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
L625428	u8613	m584	LORA	I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
L625413	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
L625412	u8613	m584	LORA	You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
L625409	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
L625408	u8613	m584	LORA	Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
L625407	u8611	m584	FLYNN	So...how's the world of serious science?
L625405	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Good luck. You can't even think in here.
L625404	u8613	m584	LORA	We have to talk.
L625403	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
L625694	u8614	m584	MCP	I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
L625693	u8616	m584	SARK	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
L625692	u8614	m584	MCP	Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
L625691	u8616	m584	SARK	Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
L625690	u8614	m584	MCP	"I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays ""Happy Birthday"" to its User once a year."
L625490	u8614	m584	MCP	End of line.
L625489	u8616	m584	SARK	Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
L625488	u8614	m584	MCP	Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
L625487	u8616	m584	SARK	Wait...I need that...
L625486	u8614	m584	MCP	You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
L625485	u8616	m584	SARK	But-what if I can't...?
L625484	u8614	m584	MCP	Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
L625483	u8616	m584	SARK	Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
L625482	u8614	m584	MCP	That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
L625481	u8616	m584	SARK	A User?
L625480	u8614	m584	MCP	He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
L625479	u8616	m584	SARK	You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
L625478	u8614	m584	MCP	I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
L625477	u8616	m584	SARK	Yes, MCP.
L625279	u8614	m584	MCP	Strategic Air Command.
L625278	u8616	m584	SARK	Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
L625277	u8614	m584	MCP	We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
L625276	u8616	m584	SARK	Thank. you, Master Control.
L625577	u8617	m584	TRON	I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
L625576	u8615	m584	RAM	Do you know what he's talking about?
L625569	u8617	m584	TRON	We have to.
L625568	u8615	m584	RAM	You think we can make it there?
L625549	u8617	m584	TRON	Do it!
L625548	u8615	m584	RAM	What do you think?
L625496	u8617	m584	TRON	They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
L625495	u8615	m584	RAM	The Users...you really think they're still there?
L625494	u8617	m584	TRON	Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
L625493	u8615	m584	RAM	New guy...
L625827	u8617	m584	TRON	Where's Flynn?
L625826	u8618	m584	YORI	It's something Users do.
L625825	u8617	m584	TRON	Nice...
L625744	u8618	m584	YORI	I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
L625743	u8617	m584	TRON	We have to get off this beam!
L625742	u8618	m584	YORI	Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
L625741	u8617	m584	TRON	What is it?
L625705	u8618	m584	YORI	Then I owe you some thanks...
L625704	u8617	m584	TRON	This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
L625687	u8617	m584	TRON	As long as it gets us out of here
L625686	u8618	m584	YORI	Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
L625635	u8617	m584	TRON	I had to...in the games...
L625634	u8618	m584	YORI	You've grown, big program.
L625631	u8618	m584	YORI	It's a flat. But wait a micro...
L625630	u8617	m584	TRON	Why is everything...like this?
L625629	u8618	m584	YORI	My quarters.
L625628	u8617	m584	TRON	Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
L625627	u8618	m584	YORI	How?
L625626	u8617	m584	TRON	That's all going to change, Yori...
L625625	u8618	m584	YORI	I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
L625621	u8618	m584	YORI	Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
L625620	u8617	m584	TRON	Yori... hey...
L630037	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
L630036	u8657	m587	COLE	I understand.  There'd be no point.
L630029	u8657	m587	COLE	"Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...""dimensions."" It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not."
L630028	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	"You said we weren't ""real,"" Cole..."
L630025	u8657	m587	COLE	No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
L630024	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	"The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become ""addicted"" have you, Cole?  To that ""dying"" world'"
L630006	u8657	m587	COLE	"I DON'T WANT YOUR ""WOMEN,"" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!"
L630005	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Women will want to get to know you...
L629711	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
L629710	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Him?  You saw that man?
L629694	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, what?
L629693	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Well?
L629498	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
L629497	u8657	m587	COLE	No, sir!
L629489	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, I didn't hear the...
L629488	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Wake up, Cole.
L629479	u8657	m587	COLE	I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
L629478	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We want you to tell us about last night.
L630002	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	This is it, James...what you've been working for.
L630001	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	We're very close!  Because of you!
L629993	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	You're still a little... disoriented.
L629992	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
L629696	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
L629695	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
L629502	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	For a man in your position...an opportunity.
L629501	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	"We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with ""unstable"" types."
L629496	u8660	m587	ENGINEER	You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
L629495	u8654	m587	ASTROPHYSICIST	To be determined by the proper authorities.
L630089	u8661	m587	FALE	Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
L630088	u8655	m587	BEN	Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
L630056	u8661	m587	FALE	She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
L630055	u8655	m587	BEN	What's she doing?
L630054	u8661	m587	FALE	It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
L629850	u8655	m587	BEN	What are you going to do with us?
L629849	u8661	m587	FALE	That's him.
L629842	u8661	m587	FALE	Shut up!
L629841	u8655	m587	BEN	I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
L630052	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
L630051	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	So that...???
L630050	u8657	m587	COLE	To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
L630049	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	And your only goal is...???
L630048	u8657	m587	COLE	That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630047	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Meaning...???
L630046	u8657	m587	COLE	San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630045	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
L630044	u8657	m587	COLE	It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
L630043	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
L629705	u8657	m587	COLE	I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
L629704	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
L629703	u8657	m587	COLE	They forced me to take drugs.
L629485	u8657	m587	COLE	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
L629484	u8656	m587	BOTANIST	It's important to observe everything.
L630221	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
L630220	u8657	m587	COLE	Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
L630219	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
L630218	u8657	m587	COLE	I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
L630217	u8666	m587	RAILLY	They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
L630215	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
L630214	u8657	m587	COLE	I know this place! ... This is my dream.
L630209	u8657	m587	COLE	"On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, ""We did it."""
L630208	u8666	m587	RAILLY	That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
L630200	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
L630199	u8657	m587	COLE	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
L630198	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Well, you look pretty different, too.
L630197	u8657	m587	COLE	You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
L630191	u8666	m587	RAILLY	In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
L630190	u8657	m587	COLE	But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
L630189	u8666	m587	RAILLY	So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
L630188	u8657	m587	COLE	Why are we doing this?
L630186	u8657	m587	COLE	Flowers!  What flowers?
L630185	u8666	m587	RAILLY	If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
L630184	u8657	m587	COLE	I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
L630183	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
L630182	u8657	m587	COLE	I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
L630153	u8657	m587	COLE	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
L630152	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You... you couldn't have heard me.
L630150	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
L630149	u8657	m587	COLE	You... you left them a message?
L630148	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
L630147	u8657	m587	COLE	A Carpet Cleaning Company?
L630146	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
L630133	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I...I...We need cash, James.
L630132	u8657	m587	COLE	You want me to rob him?
L630123	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
L630122	u8657	m587	COLE	I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
L630121	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
L630120	u8657	m587	COLE	You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
L630119	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
L630118	u8657	m587	COLE	...I had a dream about...something like that.
L630117	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What does this mean to you?
L630115	u8666	m587	RAILLY	IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
L630114	u8657	m587	COLE	I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
L630113	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
L630112	u8657	m587	COLE	It was?  I didn't...know.
L630111	u8666	m587	RAILLY	The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
L630110	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't know -- I don't remember.
L630109	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
L630108	u8657	m587	COLE	No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
L630107	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Just like that?  You were in prison?
L630106	u8657	m587	COLE	I thought I was in...prison again.
L630105	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
L630098	u8657	m587	COLE	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
L630097	u8666	m587	RAILLY	We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
L630096	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't understand what we're doing.
L630082	u8657	m587	COLE	No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
L630081	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
L629962	u8657	m587	COLE	No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
L629961	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're sure?
L629960	u8657	m587	COLE	The gun! ... I lost it
L629959	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Give me the gun.
L629958	u8657	m587	COLE	It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
L629957	u8666	m587	RAILLY	First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
L629956	u8657	m587	COLE	I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
L629955	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
L629954	u8657	m587	COLE	"I'm...""mentally divergent"".  I would love to believe that."
L629953	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
L629952	u8657	m587	COLE	Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
L629951	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What made you think that?
L629950	u8657	m587	COLE	Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
L629949	u8666	m587	RAILLY	See -- you can drive after all!
L629948	u8657	m587	COLE	No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
L629947	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
L629887	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You have to give yourself up, you know.
L629886	u8657	m587	COLE	You smell so good.
L629880	u8657	m587	COLE	That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
L629879	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
L629878	u8657	m587	COLE	You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
L629877	u8657	m587	COLE	It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
L629876	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Shot!  Who shot you?
L629875	u8657	m587	COLE	I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
L629874	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What's the matter with your leg?
L629873	u8657	m587	COLE	I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
L629872	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
L629871	u8657	m587	COLE	We need gas.
L629868	u8666	m587	RAILLY	And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
L629867	u8657	m587	COLE	The guy was a total fruitcake.
L629866	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
L629865	u8657	m587	COLE	All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
L629844	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Jeffrey Mason?
L629843	u8657	m587	COLE	Mason???
L629840	u8657	m587	COLE	Lock it now!
L629839	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, why don't we...?
L629838	u8657	m587	COLE	I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
L629827	u8657	m587	COLE	I've got one now.
L629826	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You didn't have a gun before, did you?
L629825	u8657	m587	COLE	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
L629824	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
L629821	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
L629820	u8657	m587	COLE	Are you hurt?
L629814	u8657	m587	COLE	The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
L629813	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Who's keeping an eye on you?
L629812	u8657	m587	COLE	They're keeping an eye on me.
L629809	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is."
L629808	u8657	m587	COLE	Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
L629804	u8657	m587	COLE	Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
L629803	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
L629802	u8657	m587	COLE	When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
L629801	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
L629797	u8657	m587	COLE	I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
L629796	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
L629795	u8657	m587	COLE	A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
L629794	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Clues?  What kind of clues?
L629793	u8657	m587	COLE	My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
L629789	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
L629788	u8657	m587	COLE	No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
L629787	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
L629786	u8657	m587	COLE	You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
L629785	u8666	m587	RAILLY	And I was in it?  What did I do?
L629784	u8657	m587	COLE	About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
L629783	u8666	m587	RAILLY	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
L629782	u8657	m587	COLE	You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
L629777	u8657	m587	COLE	Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
L629776	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
L629775	u8657	m587	COLE	Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
L629774	u8666	m587	RAILLY	If something really happens...like what, James?
L629773	u8657	m587	COLE	"My father told me that.  ""Never cry wolf.""  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens."
L629772	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What?
L629771	u8657	m587	COLE	Never cry wolf!
L629769	u8657	m587	COLE	Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
L629768	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
L629767	u8657	m587	COLE	"You used to call me ""James""."
L629764	u8657	m587	COLE	It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
L629763	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
L629762	u8657	m587	COLE	You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
L629761	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
L629760	u8657	m587	COLE	1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
L629759	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
L629674	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
L629673	u8657	m587	COLE	No more drugs.  Please...
L629672	u8666	m587	RAILLY	It's just a shot to calm you.
L629617	u8657	m587	COLE	Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
L629616	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
L629615	u8657	m587	COLE	What?
L629614	u8666	m587	RAILLY	James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
L629613	u8657	m587	COLE	No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
L629612	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Perhaps it was a wrong number...
L629611	u8657	m587	COLE	It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
L629556	u8666	m587	RAILLY	1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
L629555	u8657	m587	COLE	No, 1995 is the past.
L629554	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
L629553	u8657	m587	COLE	1995?
L629552	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What year do you think it is?
L629551	u8657	m587	COLE	What year is it?
L629550	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Do you know what year it is?
L629549	u8657	m587	COLE	July?!
L629548	u8666	m587	RAILLY	July.
L629547	u8657	m587	COLE	This is April, right?
L629546	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
L629545	u8657	m587	COLE	I have to go.
L629544	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You're afraid of germs?
L629543	u8657	m587	COLE	It's so clean.  No germs.
L629542	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What's wonderful about the air, James?
L629541	u8657	m587	COLE	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
L629540	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Hiding?
L629539	u8657	m587	COLE	Underground.
L629538	u8666	m587	RAILLY	A jail?  Prison?
L629537	u8657	m587	COLE	I have to go.
L629536	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
L629535	u8657	m587	COLE	You wouldn't understand.
L629534	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Why not?  Most people have some ID.
L629533	u8657	m587	COLE	No.
L629532	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
L629531	u8657	m587	COLE	They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
L629530	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
L629529	u8657	m587	COLE	Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
L629528	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Do you know why you're here, James.
L629527	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to go.
L629526	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Change what?
L629525	u8657	m587	COLE	It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
L629524	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What kind of information?
L629523	u8657	m587	COLE	No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
L629522	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
L629521	u8657	m587	COLE	James!  Nobody ever calls me that.
L629520	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you ""James""?"
L629519	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to go now.
L629518	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
L629602	u8657	m587	COLE	"No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, ""voice mail"".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present."
L629601	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
L629600	u8657	m587	COLE	Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
L629599	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
L629598	u8657	m587	COLE	No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
L629597	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
L629926	u8657	m587	COLE	Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
L629925	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, ""Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"""
L629924	u8657	m587	COLE	Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
L629923	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, ""Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?""  You do remember that, don't you?"
L629922	u8657	m587	COLE	Plan?  What are you talking about?
L629921	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
L629920	u8657	m587	COLE	I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
L629918	u8657	m587	COLE	I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
L629917	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
L629916	u8657	m587	COLE	Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
L629915	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"County Hospital, right?  1989.  The ""Immaculate Escape"" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too."
L629905	u8657	m587	COLE	Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
L629904	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Excuse me -- what did you say?
L629903	u8657	m587	COLE	I'm here about some monkeys.
L629902	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
L629901	u8657	m587	COLE	You do know me.  You helped me once.
L629900	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
L629649	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Not, ""what"", babe!  When!"
L629648	u8657	m587	COLE	What...???
L629647	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
L629646	u8657	m587	COLE	What....???
L629643	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
L629642	u8657	m587	COLE	It's private.
L629641	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What're you writing?  You a reporter?
L629640	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	You know -- your plan.
L629639	u8657	m587	COLE	What are you talking about???
L629638	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about ""you know what""."
L629637	u8657	m587	COLE	Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
L629636	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
L629635	u8657	m587	COLE	They hurt you!
L629632	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
L629631	u8657	m587	COLE	What's that mean?
L629630	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
L629629	u8657	m587	COLE	If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
L629628	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
L629627	u8657	m587	COLE	I'm not crazy.
L629626	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"What about the germs?  I say.  He goes, ""I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!"" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?"
L629625	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things"" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!"
L629624	u8657	m587	COLE	Germs?!
L629574	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
L629573	u8657	m587	COLE	I need to make a telephone call.
L629572	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
L630251	u8657	m587	COLE	Who am I supposed to shoot?
L630250	u8664	m587	JOSE	They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
L630249	u8657	m587	COLE	It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
L630248	u8664	m587	JOSE	Hey, man...
L630247	u8657	m587	COLE	This part isn't about the virus, is it?
L630241	u8664	m587	JOSE	"Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... ""weird"" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!"
L630240	u8657	m587	COLE	The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
L630239	u8664	m587	JOSE	The phone call, man.  The phone call.
L630238	u8657	m587	COLE	How did you find me?
L630237	u8664	m587	JOSE	Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
L630235	u8664	m587	JOSE	Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
L630234	u8657	m587	COLE	Jo...Jose????
L629737	u8664	m587	JOSE	Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
L629736	u8657	m587	COLE	JOSE!
L630031	u8657	m587	COLE	Yes, sir.
L630030	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	But you know what's real now?
L629699	u8657	m587	COLE	I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
L629698	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
L629697	u8657	m587	COLE	Uh, that message...me?
L629491	u8657	m587	COLE	Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
L629490	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	I asked you, why did you volunteer?
L629481	u8665	m587	MICROBIOLOGIST	We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
L629480	u8657	m587	COLE	I mashed the spider, didn't I?
L630013	u8666	m587	RAILLY	"And what we believe is what's accepted as ""truth"" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith."
L630012	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
L630011	u8666	m587	RAILLY	For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
L630010	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
L629687	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
L629686	u8666	m587	RAILLY	He was fully sedated!
L629681	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
L629680	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
L629679	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
L629678	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
L629677	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
L629676	u8666	m587	RAILLY	I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
L629675	u8658	m587	DR. FLETCHER	Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
L630179	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
L630178	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
L630177	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"You ""develop"" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever ""developed"" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!"
L630176	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	You're insane, Jeffrey.
L630175	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What virus are we talking about, Dad?
L630174	u8659	m587	DR. MASON	She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
L630173	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	What...virus?
L630091	u8661	m587	FALE	Then how come she knows what's going on?
L630090	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	"WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous ""pretend-friend-to- animals""?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!"
L630078	u8661	m587	FALE	That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
L630077	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
L630076	u8661	m587	FALE	"Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, ""your psychiatrist""?"
L630075	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
L630071	u8661	m587	FALE	No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
L630070	u8663	m587	JEFFREY	You really want to know?
L630069	u8661	m587	FALE	One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
L629517	u8662	m587	FRANKI	I'll be right here...just in case.
L629516	u8666	m587	RAILLY	No, thank you.
L629515	u8662	m587	FRANKI	James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
L629514	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
L629513	u8662	m587	FRANKI	You want to go in?  Examine him?
L629512	u8666	m587	RAILLY	That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
L629511	u8662	m587	FRANKI	Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
L629510	u8666	m587	RAILLY	You have him in restraints.
L629509	u8662	m587	FRANKI	Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
L629508	u8666	m587	RAILLY	He's been tested for drugs?
L629507	u8662	m587	FRANKI	-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
L630206	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
L630205	u8666	m587	RAILLY	What?  What did you say?
L630204	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
L630203	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
L630202	u8667	m587	WOMAN CABBIE	Might be tight.
L630201	u8666	m587	RAILLY	Nine thirty
L643258	u8803	m597	PARKER	Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
L643257	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device ?? it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
L643256	u8803	m597	PARKER	I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
L643255	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	Me? What did I do?
L643254	u8803	m597	PARKER	You son-of?a?bitch, I'm going to kill you.
L642993	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
L642992	u8803	m597	PARKER	It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
L642991	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	It was very well?hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
L642990	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
L642989	u8803	m597	PARKER	In English, please.
L642881	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
L642880	u8803	m597	PARKER	Can you tell us what's on the disc?
L642879	u8798	m597	ALEXIEV	) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
L643084	u8800	m597	DEANE	You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on?line, yet?
L643083	u8799	m597	COX	Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
L643082	u8800	m597	DEANE	He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
L643081	u8799	m597	COX	Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
L642900	u8800	m597	DEANE	I wish we could hear them.
L642899	u8799	m597	COX	I don't know.
L642898	u8800	m597	DEANE	Why would they be going there?
L642897	u8799	m597	COX	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
L642896	u8800	m597	DEANE	What are they doing in Los Feliz?
L642786	u8800	m597	DEANE	But only you will know he's not human.
L642785	u8799	m597	COX	There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
L642784	u8800	m597	DEANE	Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
L642783	u8799	m597	COX	If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
L642782	u8800	m597	DEANE	This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
L642778	u8800	m597	DEANE	Catch him and your record's clean.
L642777	u8799	m597	COX	Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
L642771	u8799	m597	COX	Whatever.
L642770	u8800	m597	DEANE	You mean a nano?tech synthetic organism.
L642769	u8799	m597	COX	We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
L642627	u8800	m597	DEANE	Why wasn't I told?
L642626	u8799	m597	COX	My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
L643121	u8803	m597	PARKER	If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
L643120	u8799	m597	COX	On my life, I promise you I will.
L643119	u8803	m597	PARKER	When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
L643112	u8803	m597	PARKER	Then I guess we're even.
L643111	u8799	m597	COX	She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
L643108	u8803	m597	PARKER	You son?of?a?bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
L643107	u8799	m597	COX	Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
L642815	u8803	m597	PARKER	Where's my gun?
L642814	u8799	m597	COX	Sid 6.7 is now armed.
L642813	u8803	m597	PARKER	Their weapons missing?
L642812	u8799	m597	COX	Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
L642811	u8799	m597	COX	Fine ?? you want to stay here?
L642810	u8803	m597	PARKER	She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
L642809	u8799	m597	COX	This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
L642808	u8803	m597	PARKER	What she's going to do is get in my way.
L642807	u8799	m597	COX	She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
L642773	u8799	m597	COX	If you can catch him.
L642772	u8803	m597	PARKER	Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
L642768	u8799	m597	COX	Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
L642767	u8803	m597	PARKER	I've seen worse.
L642766	u8799	m597	COX	These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
L642762	u8803	m597	PARKER	It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
L642761	u8799	m597	COX	Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
L642760	u8803	m597	PARKER	You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
L642650	u8803	m597	PARKER	Do me a favor ?? keep sending them.
L642649	u8799	m597	COX	What about them?
L642648	u8803	m597	PARKER	You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
L642647	u8799	m597	COX	Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
L642646	u8803	m597	PARKER	But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
L642643	u8803	m597	PARKER	I'm getting by.
L642642	u8799	m597	COX	Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar ?? you making it okay in there?
L642641	u8803	m597	PARKER	Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
L642640	u8799	m597	COX	You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
L642639	u8803	m597	PARKER	He was a computer program for crissake.
L642638	u8799	m597	COX	What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
L642637	u8799	m597	COX	Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
L642636	u8803	m597	PARKER	Why'd.. .you pull me out?
L642635	u8799	m597	COX	You all right?
L643096	u8802	m597	MADISON	Got it.
L643095	u8799	m597	COX	Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
L643093	u8802	m597	MADISON	I don't set policy.  You have the key?
L643092	u8799	m597	COX	Why didn't anybody tell me?!
L643091	u8802	m597	MADISON	I need your help--
L643090	u8799	m597	COX	I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
L643089	u8802	m597	MADISON	There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
L643069	u8802	m597	MADISON	Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
L643068	u8799	m597	COX	You think he's smart?
L643067	u8802	m597	MADISON	I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
L643066	u8799	m597	COX	Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
L643065	u8802	m597	MADISON	I should have told him.
L642980	u8799	m597	COX	In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
L642979	u8802	m597	MADISON	Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
L642978	u8799	m597	COX	None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
L642977	u8802	m597	MADISON	Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
L642976	u8799	m597	COX	... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty?four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
L642804	u8800	m597	DEANE	I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
L642803	u8802	m597	MADISON	The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
L642802	u8800	m597	DEANE	Not if you're with him every step of the way.
L642801	u8802	m597	MADISON	Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
L642800	u8800	m597	DEANE	That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby? trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
L642790	u8800	m597	DEANE	You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
L642789	u8802	m597	MADISON	What's the assignment?
L642788	u8800	m597	DEANE	We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re?assignment.
L642787	u8802	m597	MADISON	Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
L643244	u8800	m597	DEANE	Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
L643243	u8803	m597	PARKER	Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
L643242	u8800	m597	DEANE	This better not be a wild goose chase.
L643241	u8803	m597	PARKER	You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
L643240	u8800	m597	DEANE	You know how much man power you're talking about?
L643239	u8803	m597	PARKER	Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
L643238	u8800	m597	DEANE	Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
L643237	u8803	m597	PARKER	If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
L643236	u8800	m597	DEANE	Enough to level an entire city block.
L643235	u8803	m597	PARKER	No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
L643234	u8800	m597	DEANE	It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
L643233	u8803	m597	PARKER	Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
L643232	u8800	m597	DEANE	What did you find out?
L643231	u8803	m597	PARKER	Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
L643230	u8800	m597	DEANE	Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
L642781	u8803	m597	PARKER	How do you know I won't run?
L642780	u8800	m597	DEANE	If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
L642779	u8803	m597	PARKER	What happens if I can't catch him?
L642776	u8800	m597	DEANE	This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
L642775	u8803	m597	PARKER	Not from in here.
L642774	u8800	m597	DEANE	Think you can do it?
L642765	u8800	m597	DEANE	Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
L642764	u8803	m597	PARKER	Only because I got pulled out early.
L642763	u8800	m597	DEANE	I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
L642982	u8800	m597	DEANE	Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
L642981	u8806	m597	WALLACE	It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
L642623	u8806	m597	WALLACE	I was assured the problem was corrected.
L642622	u8800	m597	DEANE	Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
L642621	u8806	m597	WALLACE	Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
L642620	u8800	m597	DEANE	What the hell happened?
L642618	u8800	m597	DEANE	Don't remind me.
L642617	u8806	m597	WALLACE	Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
L642616	u8800	m597	DEANE	What did Cox pull him out early for?
L642668	u8806	m597	WALLACE	As a matter of fact, I do.
L642667	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	He hears...everything.
L642666	u8806	m597	WALLACE	How does he know who I am?
L642664	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I understand... I understand perfectly.
L642663	u8806	m597	WALLACE	You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
L642662	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I'M WHAT?!
L642661	u8806	m597	WALLACE	You've had a year?and?a?half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
L642660	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I'm still making adjustments...
L642659	u8806	m597	WALLACE	Of the six prison inmates you've tested ?? all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -? only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
L642658	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
L642657	u8806	m597	WALLACE	You embarrassed me in front of the highest?ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
L642747	u8804	m597	REILLY	What I need is a nymphomaniac.
L642746	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	You need a maid.
L642743	u8804	m597	REILLY	I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
L642742	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
L642741	u8804	m597	REILLY	... and you get nano?death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
L642740	u8804	m597	REILLY	Separate the character module from the neural net...
L642739	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	How do you kill it?
L642738	u8804	m597	REILLY	As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
L642737	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	This is supposed to be years away.
L642736	u8804	m597	REILLY	It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
L642735	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	It feels so.. .real.
L642734	u8804	m597	REILLY	Coordinated by polymer neural net.
L642733	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	It's nano?technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
L642732	u8804	m597	REILLY	Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
L642731	u8804	m597	REILLY	You're...such a wimp.
L642730	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Get that fucking thing away from me!
L642727	u8804	m597	REILLY	Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
L642726	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Do I get to see it or not?
L642725	u8804	m597	REILLY	I haven't been working on anything.
L642724	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
L642723	u8804	m597	REILLY	HEY!!!
L643184	u8802	m597	MADISON	Then fix it.
L643183	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
L643182	u8802	m597	MADISON	Talk so I can understand.
L643181	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
L643176	u8802	m597	MADISON	Turn it down!
L643175	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I wonder how that...
L643174	u8802	m597	MADISON	Show me his physical sensory level.
L643173	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	How should I know?
L643172	u8802	m597	MADISON	What's wrong with Parker?
L643171	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
L643215	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
L643214	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
L643213	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
L643211	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Glad to...
L643210	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Help me get out of here.
L643209	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	How can I ever thank?you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
L643208	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Of course you are.
L643207	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I am beautiful, aren't I?
L642754	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	What do you expect me to do, thank him?
L642753	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	SID ?? NO!!!
L642745	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	I think I understand what you have in mind...
L642744	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	You catching my drift?
L642729	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	All my work is my finest.
L642728	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
L642698	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
L642697	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
L642696	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
L642695	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	My God...
L642694	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
L642693	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
L642692	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	It was me, what?
L642691	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	It was you, wasn't it?
L642690	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
L642689	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
L642656	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Think hard -- it'll come to you...
L642655	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Should I have?
L642654	u8801	m597	LINDENMEYER	Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
L642653	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
L643284	u8803	m597	PARKER	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
L643283	u8802	m597	MADISON	What do we do now?
L643281	u8802	m597	MADISON	Duck!
L643280	u8803	m597	PARKER	Then shoot him already.
L643279	u8802	m597	MADISON	I couldn't tell you.
L643278	u8803	m597	PARKER	How's your pulse?
L643260	u8802	m597	MADISON	Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
L643259	u8803	m597	PARKER	Where the hell are you going?
L643227	u8802	m597	MADISON	I don't know.
L643226	u8803	m597	PARKER	Sid?
L643225	u8802	m597	MADISON	My guess is dead.
L643224	u8803	m597	PARKER	Lindenmeyer?
L643223	u8802	m597	MADISON	More or less.
L643222	u8803	m597	PARKER	...I think so...You?
L643221	u8802	m597	MADISON	You okay?
L643163	u8803	m597	PARKER	Because this pain?in?the?ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
L643162	u8802	m597	MADISON	That's why I'm asking.
L643161	u8803	m597	PARKER	You don't know?
L643160	u8802	m597	MADISON	You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go ?? right now.  Why are you going to do this?
L643159	u8803	m597	PARKER	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
L643158	u8802	m597	MADISON	Can I ask you something?
L643156	u8803	m597	PARKER	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
L643155	u8802	m597	MADISON	Find out anything?
L643136	u8802	m597	MADISON	Thanks.
L643135	u8803	m597	PARKER	Nice work.
L643134	u8802	m597	MADISON	I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
L643133	u8803	m597	PARKER	See something?
L643132	u8802	m597	MADISON	That, or living through him...
L643131	u8803	m597	PARKER	Think he's keeping track of his creation?
L643130	u8802	m597	MADISON	If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
L643129	u8803	m597	PARKER	Part of him is.
L643128	u8802	m597	MADISON	Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
L643127	u8803	m597	PARKER	I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
L643126	u8802	m597	MADISON	The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
L643117	u8802	m597	MADISON	I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
L643116	u8803	m597	PARKER	I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
L643115	u8802	m597	MADISON	You're not capable of it.
L643114	u8803	m597	PARKER	Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
L643113	u8802	m597	MADISON	How did you find out about the toxin?
L643110	u8803	m597	PARKER	You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
L643109	u8802	m597	MADISON	He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
L643105	u8803	m597	PARKER	They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
L643104	u8802	m597	MADISON	We know you didn't kill those guards.
L643055	u8802	m597	MADISON	No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
L643054	u8803	m597	PARKER	Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
L643043	u8803	m597	PARKER	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
L643042	u8802	m597	MADISON	Parker -? stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you??
L643031	u8803	m597	PARKER	Both.
L643030	u8802	m597	MADISON	Which way?
L643029	u8803	m597	PARKER	Authority still makes me nervous.
L643028	u8802	m597	MADISON	You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
L643027	u8803	m597	PARKER	Real effective security...
L643012	u8803	m597	PARKER	You like baseball?
L643011	u8802	m597	MADISON	It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
L643005	u8802	m597	MADISON	I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
L643004	u8803	m597	PARKER	Start of what?
L643003	u8802	m597	MADISON	Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
L642975	u8802	m597	MADISON	I'm doing the best I can!
L642974	u8803	m597	PARKER	What's the problem?
L642955	u8803	m597	PARKER	Tell him.
L642954	u8802	m597	MADISON	This isn't a game, Parker!
L642953	u8803	m597	PARKER	You know I am.
L642952	u8802	m597	MADISON	Enjoying yourself?
L642951	u8803	m597	PARKER	Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
L642950	u8803	m597	PARKER	Nothing.
L642949	u8802	m597	MADISON	What did you do to those people?
L642948	u8803	m597	PARKER	This is my area of expertise.
L642947	u8802	m597	MADISON	What the hell's going on?!
L642939	u8803	m597	PARKER	Stop me.
L642938	u8802	m597	MADISON	Don't get out of the car.
L642934	u8803	m597	PARKER	Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
L642933	u8802	m597	MADISON	I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
L642932	u8803	m597	PARKER	Relax. I know what you meant.
L642931	u8802	m597	MADISON	Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
L642930	u8803	m597	PARKER	Don't worry about it, all right?
L642929	u8802	m597	MADISON	You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re?adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
L642928	u8803	m597	PARKER	I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
L642924	u8803	m597	PARKER	Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
L642923	u8802	m597	MADISON	What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
L642922	u8803	m597	PARKER	Sounds to me like a well?educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
L642921	u8802	m597	MADISON	Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
L642920	u8803	m597	PARKER	What does that mean?
L642919	u8802	m597	MADISON	Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
L642918	u8803	m597	PARKER	You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
L642917	u8802	m597	MADISON	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
L642916	u8803	m597	PARKER	Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
L642915	u8802	m597	MADISON	Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
L642914	u8803	m597	PARKER	She's beautiful, you know?
L642913	u8802	m597	MADISON	I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
L642912	u8803	m597	PARKER	Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
L642910	u8802	m597	MADISON	How did you get your hand out?
L642909	u8803	m597	PARKER	Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
L642906	u8802	m597	MADISON	And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
L642905	u8803	m597	PARKER	Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
L642904	u8802	m597	MADISON	Give me your wrist.
L642878	u8802	m597	MADISON	In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
L642877	u8803	m597	PARKER	What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son?of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
L642876	u8802	m597	MADISON	Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
L642875	u8803	m597	PARKER	Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
L642874	u8802	m597	MADISON	As a matter of fact, it is.
L642873	u8803	m597	PARKER	This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
L642870	u8802	m597	MADISON	But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
L642869	u8803	m597	PARKER	Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
L642868	u8802	m597	MADISON	Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
L642867	u8802	m597	MADISON	He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
L642866	u8803	m597	PARKER	Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
L642865	u8802	m597	MADISON	Who said that?
L642864	u8803	m597	PARKER	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
L642863	u8802	m597	MADISON	I am impressed.
L642862	u8803	m597	PARKER	... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
L642861	u8802	m597	MADISON	I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
L642860	u8803	m597	PARKER	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
L642859	u8802	m597	MADISON	The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
L642858	u8803	m597	PARKER	I've been in prison, remember?
L642857	u8802	m597	MADISON	Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
L642856	u8802	m597	MADISON	I'm still working on it.
L642855	u8803	m597	PARKER	I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
L642854	u8803	m597	PARKER	Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
L642853	u8802	m597	MADISON	This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
L642852	u8803	m597	PARKER	You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
L642851	u8802	m597	MADISON	Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
L642850	u8803	m597	PARKER	What are you doing?
L642848	u8803	m597	PARKER	Do me one favor ?? if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
L642847	u8802	m597	MADISON	You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
L642840	u8802	m597	MADISON	Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
L642839	u8803	m597	PARKER	What happened when he was 17?
L642838	u8802	m597	MADISON	He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
L642837	u8803	m597	PARKER	Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
L642835	u8803	m597	PARKER	I know who would know.
L642834	u8802	m597	MADISON	I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
L642833	u8803	m597	PARKER	Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
L642832	u8802	m597	MADISON	Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better ?? to improve upon what was already done.
L642831	u8803	m597	PARKER	Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
L642830	u8802	m597	MADISON	He was re?enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
L642827	u8803	m597	PARKER	Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
L642826	u8802	m597	MADISON	You ready for this?
L642823	u8803	m597	PARKER	Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
L642822	u8802	m597	MADISON	You all right?
L642821	u8803	m597	PARKER	Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
L642820	u8802	m597	MADISON	It wasn't a lie.
L642819	u8803	m597	PARKER	Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
L642806	u8802	m597	MADISON	What you need is a collar.
L642805	u8803	m597	PARKER	I don't need a baby?sitter.
L642720	u8803	m597	PARKER	I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
L642719	u8802	m597	MADISON	I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
L642717	u8803	m597	PARKER	Enough!
L642716	u8802	m597	MADISON	It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
L642715	u8803	m597	PARKER	Go to hell.
L642714	u8802	m597	MADISON	You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
L642713	u8803	m597	PARKER	Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
L642712	u8802	m597	MADISON	What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
L642711	u8803	m597	PARKER	If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
L642710	u8802	m597	MADISON	That's not true, Parker.
L642709	u8803	m597	PARKER	You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it ?? I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
L642708	u8802	m597	MADISON	I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
L642707	u8803	m597	PARKER	John died.
L642706	u8802	m597	MADISON	In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
L642705	u8803	m597	PARKER	A little less than yesterday.
L642704	u8802	m597	MADISON	No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
L642703	u8803	m597	PARKER	You actually listen to all those tapes?
L643276	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
L643275	u8803	m597	PARKER	Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
L643201	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
L643200	u8803	m597	PARKER	What are you talking about?
L643199	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
L643198	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I've got some final preparations to take care of?? Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
L643197	u8803	m597	PARKER	Aren't you going to watch with me?
L643196	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re?Election Rally...
L643195	u8803	m597	PARKER	You are going after Mayor Bennett.
L643194	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	There you go ?? best seat in the house.
L643191	u8803	m597	PARKER	I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
L643190	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
L643169	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	My...secret.
L643168	u8803	m597	PARKER	You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
L643167	u8803	m597	PARKER	Where did you plant the C-4?!
L643166	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
L643165	u8803	m597	PARKER	What C-4...was Cox talking about?
L643154	u8803	m597	PARKER	Where did you plant the C-4?!
L643153	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
L643152	u8803	m597	PARKER	What C-4...was Cox talking about?
L643143	u8803	m597	PARKER	Why's that?
L643142	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you??
L643077	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
L643076	u8803	m597	PARKER	DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
L643075	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
L643074	u8803	m597	PARKER	GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
L643073	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
L643072	u8803	m597	PARKER	You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
L642963	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
L642962	u8803	m597	PARKER	You and me have nothing in common.
L642961	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common ?? we have such history together ??I've been thinking we should become friends.
L642960	u8803	m597	PARKER	The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
L642959	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	The symphony of collision...
L642609	u8805	m597	SID 6.7	Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
L642608	u8803	m597	PARKER	Where's John?
L642688	u8804	m597	REILLY	At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
L642687	u8806	m597	WALLACE	Do they have to look so...robotic?
L642686	u8804	m597	REILLY	Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
L642685	u8806	m597	WALLACE	As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
L642684	u8804	m597	REILLY	As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
L642683	u8806	m597	WALLACE	To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
L657170	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'm sure we will.
L657169	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
L657163	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
L657162	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What is this?  A whole new train?
L657161	u8923	m607	JIM	Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
L657151	u8923	m607	JIM	In the next two minutes?
L657150	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
L657149	u8923	m607	JIM	He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
L657148	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
L657121	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, I see, an easy plan!
L657120	u8923	m607	JIM	Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
L657115	u8923	m607	JIM	Where have you been?
L657114	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My God!  He's so excessive!
L657078	u8923	m607	JIM	That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
L657077	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	God in heaven, what is that?!
L657070	u8923	m607	JIM	Thank you.
L657069	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My hat is off to you, sir.
L657066	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Of course not.
L657065	u8923	m607	JIM	Are those just button buttons or...?
L657064	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
L657063	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It was in your book.
L657058	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
L657057	u8923	m607	JIM	There's only seventy-eight.
L657056	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
L657055	u8923	m607	JIM	We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
L657054	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
L657053	u8923	m607	JIM	I know!  I know!
L657052	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What?  President Grant is...!
L657051	u8923	m607	JIM	Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
L657002	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My pleasure.
L657001	u8923	m607	JIM	Oh, thank you.
L657000	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
L656996	u8923	m607	JIM	Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
L656995	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
L656983	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
L656982	u8923	m607	JIM	When we find him, he is mine.
L656980	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
L656979	u8923	m607	JIM	So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
L656978	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I adjusted it.
L656977	u8923	m607	JIM	Not again.
L656976	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
L656975	u8923	m607	JIM	And people are actually fooled by that?
L656974	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
L656973	u8923	m607	JIM	What is that?
L656971	u8923	m607	JIM	We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
L656970	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Relax.  We're almost there.
L656969	u8923	m607	JIM	Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
L656968	u8923	m607	JIM	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
L656967	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	"Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was ""damnably hot."""
L656966	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It's a town!
L656965	u8923	m607	JIM	It's not a guy...
L656964	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Willard...
L656955	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
L656954	u8923	m607	JIM	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
L656953	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What's this?
L656952	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
L656951	u8923	m607	JIM	No record of him.
L656950	u8923	m607	JIM	He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
L656949	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It is?
L656948	u8923	m607	JIM	It's better than nothing.
L656947	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, damn!  That's it.
L656945	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
L656944	u8923	m607	JIM	This is good.
L656938	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
L656937	u8923	m607	JIM	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
L656936	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Know what this is?
L656898	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
L656897	u8923	m607	JIM	Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
L656896	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Thank you.
L656895	u8923	m607	JIM	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
L656894	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Can you fill me in here?
L656884	u8923	m607	JIM	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
L656883	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	They're so precious when they're asleep.
L656881	u8923	m607	JIM	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
L656880	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
L656879	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
L656878	u8923	m607	JIM	You might have mentioned you had that.
L656874	u8923	m607	JIM	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
L656873	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Uh... how long ago was this?
L656872	u8923	m607	JIM	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
L656871	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	So... what happened?
L656870	u8923	m607	JIM	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
L656869	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well... that, too.
L656868	u8923	m607	JIM	"Spontaneous.  I like that.  Most people say something like ""hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."""
L656867	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
L656866	u8923	m607	JIM	What way is that?
L656865	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
L656864	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
L656863	u8923	m607	JIM	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
L656862	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Jim, are you all right?
L656858	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	That's right... That's good.
L656857	u8923	m607	JIM	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
L656856	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Damn it, this is ridiculous.
L656855	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Hey, I tried the board.
L656854	u8923	m607	JIM	At least I tried something.
L656850	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It's a repeating steam cannon!
L656849	u8923	m607	JIM	Never seen a gun fire so fast!
L656848	u8923	m607	JIM	I'm going to hit you.
L656847	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
L656845	u8923	m607	JIM	And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
L656844	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
L656835	u8923	m607	JIM	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
L656834	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	All that jumping and kicking.
L656833	u8923	m607	JIM	All what?
L656832	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What was all that back there?
L656811	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
L656810	u8923	m607	JIM	"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""
L656809	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Now, what was that?
L656808	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
L656807	u8923	m607	JIM	You feeling all right?
L656806	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  Now, observe....
L656805	u8923	m607	JIM	Almost?
L656804	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
L656800	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
L656799	u8923	m607	JIM	All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
L656798	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
L656797	u8923	m607	JIM	Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
L656720	u8923	m607	JIM	Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
L656719	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
L656718	u8923	m607	JIM	That's a lot of butler.
L656716	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
L656715	u8923	m607	JIM	Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
L656714	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
L656712	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My disguise.  And here...
L656711	u8923	m607	JIM	Prepare what?
L656710	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
L656709	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
L656708	u8923	m607	JIM	Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
L656707	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Limestone quarry?
L656697	u8923	m607	JIM	What about the explosive?
L656696	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
L656695	u8923	m607	JIM	Starting with a screw?
L656694	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
L656693	u8923	m607	JIM	Is this leading somewhere?
L656692	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
L656691	u8923	m607	JIM	Aha?
L656690	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Aha!
L656667	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'll work on it.
L656666	u8923	m607	JIM	That should put us ahead of the criminals.
L656663	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
L656662	u8923	m607	JIM	Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
L656661	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Try what?
L656660	u8923	m607	JIM	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
L656659	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
L656658	u8923	m607	JIM	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
L656657	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Always hoping.  Or this...
L656656	u8923	m607	JIM	You need that real often?
L656655	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
L656653	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Gadget guy?  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
L656652	u8923	m607	JIM	Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
L656651	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
L656650	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Ay, there's the rub.  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
L656649	u8923	m607	JIM	Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
L656648	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
L656647	u8923	m607	JIM	Put them all together and what do we have?
L656646	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
L656645	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Wouldn't dream of it.
L656644	u8923	m607	JIM	But don't pull that again.
L656632	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
L656631	u8923	m607	JIM	You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
L656630	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
L656629	u8923	m607	JIM	Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
L656628	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
L656627	u8923	m607	JIM	Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
L656626	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
L656625	u8923	m607	JIM	Funny.  So am I.
L656624	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
L656623	u8923	m607	JIM	I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
L656622	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
L656621	u8923	m607	JIM	Jim West.
L656620	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	J. S. Bach.
L657107	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
L657106	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
L657088	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
L657087	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He's not giving up?
L657080	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	But it only has six legs.
L657079	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He calls it the Tarantula.
L657060	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
L657059	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You didn't tell us you had this on!
L656824	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
L656823	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Yes, me!
L656822	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
L657095	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
L657094	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
L657093	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	I could get used to this, looking down on people.
L656762	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
L656761	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
L656760	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Anyone?
L656749	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	We'll see.
L656748	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	A new friend?
L657128	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Fine, I'll stop.
L657127	u8923	m607	JIM	You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
L656910	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
L656909	u8923	m607	JIM	You bring the best out in a man.
L656908	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	My.  It's gotten longer.
L656905	u8923	m607	JIM	Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
L656904	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	She's perfectly safe.
L656789	u8923	m607	JIM	I've had some practice.
L656788	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You've... done... this... before.
L656787	u8923	m607	JIM	Oh, I would hope not.
L656786	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Would that include me?
L656785	u8923	m607	JIM	Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
L656782	u8923	m607	JIM	I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
L656781	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
L656780	u8923	m607	JIM	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
L656779	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
L656778	u8923	m607	JIM	You tell me.
L656777	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
L656774	u8923	m607	JIM	I don't like to lose, either.
L656773	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
L656743	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You most certainly do.
L656742	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
L656741	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
L656740	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
L656739	u8923	m607	JIM	Your guests, ma'am?
L656738	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
L656735	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	My... the wild west.
L656734	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
L656733	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Really?
L656732	u8923	m607	JIM	Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
L656731	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
L656730	u8923	m607	JIM	You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
L656729	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
L656728	u8923	m607	JIM	My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
L657105	u8923	m607	JIM	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
L657104	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
L656618	u8923	m607	JIM	My friend?
L656617	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
L656616	u8921	m607	DOYLE	That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
L656615	u8923	m607	JIM	Private train?
L656614	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Your private train, sir.
L656613	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
L656612	u8923	m607	JIM	Look, I'm Captain James West...
L656594	u8922	m607	GRANT	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
L656593	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
L656584	u8922	m607	GRANT	French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
L656583	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Yes sir.
L656582	u8922	m607	GRANT	French?
L656581	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
L656580	u8922	m607	GRANT	Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
L656579	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
L656578	u8922	m607	GRANT	Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
L656963	u8922	m607	GRANT	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
L656962	u8923	m607	JIM	Where'd he say he was going to do this?
L656958	u8922	m607	GRANT	On my way to Denver...
L656957	u8923	m607	JIM	... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
L656607	u8922	m607	GRANT	And now the job's yours.
L656606	u8923	m607	JIM	And?
L656605	u8922	m607	GRANT	Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
L656604	u8922	m607	GRANT	Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
L656603	u8923	m607	JIM	Nicely said, sir.
L656602	u8922	m607	GRANT	We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
L656601	u8922	m607	GRANT	Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
L656600	u8923	m607	JIM	But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
L656592	u8923	m607	JIM	Nice to finally meet you, sir.
L656591	u8922	m607	GRANT	This is Colonel Richards.
L656590	u8923	m607	JIM	Good work.  Really.
L656589	u8922	m607	GRANT	That'll be all, boys.
L656588	u8923	m607	JIM	Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
L657140	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
L657139	u8923	m607	JIM	Easy now.
L657027	u8923	m607	JIM	So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
L657026	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
L657025	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
L657024	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	The first.
L657023	u8923	m607	JIM	Emperor Miguelito...?
L657022	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	I've even printed my own currency.
L657019	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
L657018	u8923	m607	JIM	That would be... the Mexican War?
L657017	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
L657016	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
L657015	u8923	m607	JIM	The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
L657013	u8923	m607	JIM	Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
L657012	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
L657011	u8923	m607	JIM	You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
L657010	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Philistine.
L657009	u8923	m607	JIM	He had a pressing engagement.
L657008	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
L657006	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
L657005	u8923	m607	JIM	You're not that big.
L656940	u8923	m607	JIM	Dr. Loveless?
L656939	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
L656927	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
L656926	u8923	m607	JIM	Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
L656769	u8923	m607	JIM	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
L656768	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
L656766	u8923	m607	JIM	I deal with some tough customers.
L656765	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
L656764	u8923	m607	JIM	No, sir... just a businessman.
L656763	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
L656757	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
L656756	u8923	m607	JIM	I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
L656754	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
L656753	u8923	m607	JIM	I admire a man with a sense of humor.
L657076	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
L657075	u8923	m607	JIM	I beg your pardon?
L657042	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	It is?
L657041	u8923	m607	JIM	Now it's a bomb.
L657040	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	It's a smelting retort.
L657039	u8923	m607	JIM	This is something.
L657038	u8923	m607	JIM	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
L657037	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
L657034	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
L657033	u8923	m607	JIM	Are you all right?
L656843	u8923	m607	JIM	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
L656842	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
L656841	u8923	m607	JIM	Who was this partner of his?
L656840	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	"I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the ""rare and unparalleled opportunity"" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do."
L656831	u8923	m607	JIM	We'll explain on the way.
L656830	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
L656829	u8923	m607	JIM	Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
L656819	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Yes!
L656818	u8923	m607	JIM	Dr. Pemberton?
L656549	u8923	m607	JIM	Right.
L656548	u8927	m607	WALTERS	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
L656547	u8923	m607	JIM	You're not going to use it, are you?
L656546	u8927	m607	WALTERS	Hey...!
L656545	u8923	m607	JIM	In an hour they're gone!
L656544	u8927	m607	WALTERS	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
L656543	u8923	m607	JIM	When are they coming?
L656542	u8927	m607	WALTERS	They're coming.
L656541	u8923	m607	JIM	Well?
L663447	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Please.
L663446	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What?!
L663445	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Why?  What's the problem?
L663441	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642	u8976	m612	ANALYST	We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	"What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?"
L663640	u8976	m612	ANALYST	As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What about our end?
L663303	u8977	m612	BURNS	They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302	u8981	m612	HYDE	Washington?
L663301	u8977	m612	BURNS	He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300	u8981	m612	HYDE	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299	u8977	m612	BURNS	No idea who's behind this?
L663298	u8981	m612	HYDE	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297	u8977	m612	BURNS	Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	We don't know that.
L663828	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	God isn't there to do it.
L663827	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	A whore fucking.
L663779	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Wrong answers?
L663776	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Don't call me that.
L663774	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter --
L664176	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What's your theory?
L663361	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360	u8990	m612	VEIDT	"Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen."
L663357	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The bearer of bad news.
L663352	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Hello, Adrian.
L663351	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Hi, Jon.
L664185	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
L664183	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon --
L664169	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Veidts complex.
L664168	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, where are we?
L664155	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
L664154	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- what??
L664153	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
L664141	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Cured, yes.
L664140	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What -- am I --
L664139	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I won't do that.
L664135	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You're the only human being I care for.
L664133	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
L664080	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
L664079	u8985	m612	LAURIE	"Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?"
L664078	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Because --
L664077	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073	u8985	m612	LAURIE	But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
L664060	u8985	m612	LAURIE	This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Collect me?
L664037	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I could stay and go.
L663395	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Mm hmm.
L663394	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Would you like me to stay?
L663392	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm here, Laurie.
L663359	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Blake?  Dead?
L664172	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What if youre wrong??
L664163	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Im not.
L664162	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	And what if youre wrong?
L664161	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
L664150	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What is it?  How does it work?
L664146	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What??
L664111	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The missing scientists.
L664109	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	She's with me.
L663800	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Who?
L663343	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good night.
L663342	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340	u8990	m612	VEIDT	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334	u8990	m612	VEIDT	My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215	u8985	m612	LAURIE	We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Everything's changed --
L664200	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Where did he go?
L664195	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What was he doing?
L664018	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985	u8985	m612	LAURIE	My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I think he's going to the john.
L663983	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What's he doing?
L663949	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . What??
L663948	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's because --
L663944	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yes you are.
L663942	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What?
L663923	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're practically on us . . .
L663921	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're following us.
L663891	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890	u8985	m612	LAURIE	It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What the hell -- ?
L663869	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay!
L663868	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What are you up to?
L663865	u8985	m612	LAURIE	God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You and me.
L663860	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Antarctica??
L663857	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Memory lane.
L663848	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie --
L663807	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- What is it.
L663805	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . What?
L663723	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Old?
L663721	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	His . . . whatever.
L663695	u8985	m612	LAURIE	His what?
L663663	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're sure?
L663657	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Damn straight.
L663420	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
L664087	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What caused it?
L664086	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
L664085	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What happened?
L664057	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
L664056	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
L664055	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	SHUT UP, Rorschach.
L664054	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Coward.  Giving up.
L664053	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
L664044	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't think she's coming with us.
L664043	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Where's Laurie?
L664024	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
L664023	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
L664021	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
L664020	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What do you mean, frame-up?
L664019	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
L663999	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
L663998	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What new information?
L663997	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . That was quick.
L663327	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
L663324	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	So do I.  So do you.
L663322	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
L663321	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
L663319	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
L663318	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
L663545	u8983	m612	JON	My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
L663544	u8982	m612	JANEY	-- What?
L663543	u8983	m612	JON	I can fix it.
L663539	u8983	m612	JON	Janey, will you marry me?
L663538	u8982	m612	JANEY	Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
L663536	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back --  What?
L663533	u8983	m612	JON	Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532	u8982	m612	JANEY	Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530	u8982	m612	JANEY	With lots of ketchup?
L663529	u8983	m612	JON	I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Isn't it true that you --
L663786	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No comment.
L663682	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Am I free to go?
L663593	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	I'm terribly sorry.
L663464	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	"You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"
L663460	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names!
L663459	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names.
L663457	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Their real names, please.
L663379	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Maybe I'll do that.
L663377	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What about you?
L663374	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371	u8990	m612	VEIDT	He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Please.
L663369	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350	u8985	m612	LAURIE	He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349	u8990	m612	VEIDT	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't rub it in.  I live here.
L663347	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Laurie!  Good to see you.
L663346	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Adrian.
L663671	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
L663670	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
L663629	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
L663628	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
L663627	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
L663626	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
L663622	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
L663621	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
L663620	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	You're making a big --
L663619	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
L663618	u8986	m612	MOLOCH	I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
L664123	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
L664122	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
L664119	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
L664118	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
L664113	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
L664112	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
L663691	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
L663690	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
L663689	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
L663688	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What is that ungodly smell?
L663687	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
L663686	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Ever see one of these before?
L663685	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	New information.
L664564	u9009	m614	STORM	Beast.
L664563	u9002	m614	BEAST	Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
L664562	u9009	m614	STORM	We all do.
L664561	u9002	m614	BEAST	I wish I could go.
L664555	u9009	m614	STORM	... until he found tungsten.
L664554	u9002	m614	BEAST	Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
L664509	u9002	m614	BEAST	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
L664508	u9009	m614	STORM	What does that mean?
L664559	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
L664558	u9002	m614	BEAST	Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
L664557	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	For what purpose?
L664556	u9002	m614	BEAST	Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
L664553	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Its core?
L664552	u9002	m614	BEAST	It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
L664511	u9002	m614	BEAST	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
L664510	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Can the Professor repair his own mind?
L664610	u9004	m614	JEAN	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
L664609	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Jean... can you?
L664595	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
L664594	u9004	m614	JEAN	It's too far.
L664593	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
L664575	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Uh-huh.
L664574	u9004	m614	JEAN	Into the Hudson?
L664573	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
L664570	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
L664569	u9004	m614	JEAN	What's that?
L664568	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	I'll tell you one thing though.
L664567	u9004	m614	JEAN	Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
L664566	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
L664515	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
L664514	u9004	m614	JEAN	Are you all right?
L664513	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	We have to find Magneto.
L664512	u9004	m614	JEAN	He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
L664503	u9004	m614	JEAN	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
L664502	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	What's wrong with him?
L664396	u9004	m614	JEAN	If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
L664395	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
L664394	u9004	m614	JEAN	What are you talking about?
L664393	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	I don't like him being here.
L664392	u9004	m614	JEAN	Scott.. I -
L664642	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	Sure you are, sport.
L664641	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
L664427	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
L664426	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	You know, you --
L664425	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
L664423	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L664422	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	How long have you been in Alaska?
L664419	u9003	m614	CYCLOPS	I wanted to talk to you.
L664418	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
L664482	u9004	m614	JEAN	Yeah, I'll bet you have.
L664481	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I've seen a lot of rings.
L664480	u9004	m614	JEAN	Logan, do you see this ring?
L664478	u9004	m614	JEAN	What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
L664477	u9006	m614	LOGAN	He takes himself seriously.
L664476	u9004	m614	JEAN	He takes his work seriously.
L664475	u9006	m614	LOGAN	He's uptight.
L664474	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Suit yourself.
L664473	u9004	m614	JEAN	Let go.
L664472	u9004	m614	JEAN	Not interested.
L664471	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What do you say?
L664470	u9004	m614	JEAN	Were you now?
L664469	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
L664468	u9004	m614	JEAN	He's busy right now.
L664467	u9006	m614	LOGAN	You should always work with a spotter.
L664390	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What if they're naughty?
L664389	u9004	m614	JEAN	If necessary.
L664388	u9006	m614	LOGAN	By reading my thoughts?
L664387	u9004	m614	JEAN	Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
L664386	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
L664385	u9004	m614	JEAN	The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
L664384	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What if I like the pain?
L664383	u9004	m614	JEAN	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
L664382	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I won't light the cigars - how about that?
L664381	u9004	m614	JEAN	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
L664380	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Some cigars.  Case of beer.
L664379	u9004	m614	JEAN	Anything else I can get you?
L664537	u9005	m614	KELLY	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664536	u9004	m614	JEAN	The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
L664526	u9005	m614	KELLY	Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
L664525	u9004	m614	JEAN	Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
L664524	u9005	m614	KELLY	I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
L664519	u9004	m614	JEAN	Senator?
L664518	u9005	m614	KELLY	Dr. Grey.
L664268	u9005	m614	KELLY	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664267	u9004	m614	JEAN	I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
L664266	u9005	m614	KELLY	This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
L664265	u9004	m614	JEAN	Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
L664264	u9005	m614	KELLY	You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
L664263	u9004	m614	JEAN	Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
L664262	u9005	m614	KELLY	Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
L664259	u9004	m614	JEAN	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
L664258	u9005	m614	KELLY	You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
L664319	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Let's just say, God works too slowly.
L664318	u9005	m614	KELLY	What is it you intend to do to me?
L664317	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
L664316	u9005	m614	KELLY	The intention of registration act -
L664312	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Gosh, I hope so.
L664311	u9005	m614	KELLY	Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
L664310	u9005	m614	KELLY	You mutant bastards...
L664309	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
L664308	u9005	m614	KELLY	You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
L664580	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
L664579	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What are you going to do?
L664578	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	You're backstage at the encore of creation.
L664577	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Where am I?
L664497	u9006	m614	LOGAN	You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
L664496	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Come with me and I'll let her live.
L664495	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What do you want?
L664494	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	I do love a good check mate.
L664654	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
L664653	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
L664652	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
L664651	u9010	m614	XAVIER	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
L664650	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Don't you knock?
L664450	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I'll go.
L664449	u9010	m614	XAVIER	I've found her, Westchester Mall.
L664447	u9010	m614	XAVIER	We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
L664446	u9006	m614	LOGAN	He helped you?
L664445	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
L664444	u9006	m614	LOGAN	You designed this yourself?
L664443	u9010	m614	XAVIER	The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
L664442	u9006	m614	LOGAN	How?
L664441	u9010	m614	XAVIER	To find Rogue.
L664440	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Where are we going?
L664436	u9010	m614	XAVIER	I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
L664435	u9006	m614	LOGAN	No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
L664434	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Now that's Magneto talking.
L664433	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
L664432	u9010	m614	XAVIER	The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
L664431	u9006	m614	LOGAN	"This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of ""team"" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?"
L664430	u9010	m614	XAVIER	The point of what?
L664371	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Deal.
L664370	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
L664303	u9010	m614	XAVIER	A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
L664302	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Who?
L664301	u9010	m614	XAVIER	I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
L664300	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What am I doing here?
L664416	u9006	m614	LOGAN	And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
L664415	u9009	m614	STORM	If she held on any longer she could have.
L664414	u9006	m614	LOGAN	I felt like she almost killed me.
L664413	u9009	m614	STORM	She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
L664412	u9006	m614	LOGAN	What did she do to me?
L664411	u9009	m614	STORM	The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
L664410	u9006	m614	LOGAN	Why is everybody up at sunrise?
L664378	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	ALIVE.
L664377	u9008	m614	SABRETOOTH	I'll find him.
L664286	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Enough for a test.
L664285	u9008	m614	SABRETOOTH	Is it enough?
L664284	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	A piece.  Only a piece.
L664283	u9008	m614	SABRETOOTH	Is that what you're looking for?
L664278	u9008	m614	SABRETOOTH	It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
L664277	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	How?
L664276	u9008	m614	SABRETOOTH	I lost him.
L664665	u9010	m614	XAVIER	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
L664664	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	And what do you do when you wake up to that?
L664663	u9010	m614	XAVIER	It does indeed, Max.
L664662	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
L664661	u9010	m614	XAVIER	I know.
L664660	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
L664365	u9010	m614	XAVIER	WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
L664364	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
L664363	u9010	m614	XAVIER	What do you mean to do?
L664362	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
L664361	u9010	m614	XAVIER	The way what is going to be?
L664360	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
L664355	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
L664354	u9010	m614	XAVIER	You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
L664353	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
L664352	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Is that so?
L664350	u9010	m614	XAVIER	What do you want with him?
L664349	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
L664346	u9010	m614	XAVIER	Not at the cost of lives, Max.
L664345	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
L664344	u9010	m614	XAVIER	And I'll never understand terrorists.
L664343	u9007	m614	MAGNETO	I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
L665374	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
L665373	u9011	m615	ANASTASIA	Oh, shit.
L665372	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
L665371	u9011	m615	ANASTASIA	And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
L665370	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Yes, my dear, he is.
L665369	u9011	m615	ANASTASIA	Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
L666093	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	Now wait a minute!
L666092	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
L666088	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Poppycock!
L666087	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
L666086	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Ugly, vicious rumous.
L666085	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
L666084	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Victor Frankenstein.
L666083	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	What was your grandfather's name?
L666082	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No!
L666081	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
L666080	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
L666079	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	And who might you be?
L666078	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You have the wrong house.
L666077	u9012	m615	BURGOMEISTER	Frederick Frankenstein?
L665456	u9017	m615	FREDDY	... No!
L665455	u9013	m615	CARLSON	Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
L665454	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
L665453	u9013	m615	CARLSON	Yes, sir?
L665452	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Carlson!
L665435	u9017	m615	FREDDY	He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
L665434	u9013	m615	CARLSON	Yes, sir.
L665424	u9013	m615	CARLSON	Yes, sir.
L665423	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Give him an extra dollar.
L665406	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
L665405	u9013	m615	CARLSON	No, sir.  It will never happen again.
L665404	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
L665403	u9013	m615	CARLSON	Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
L665402	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
L665401	u9013	m615	CARLSON	From your office, sir.
L665400	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Where did you get this cauliflower?
L665379	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
L665378	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
L665377	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
L665368	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
L665367	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
L665366	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
L665365	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
L665364	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
L665363	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	I did, sir.
L665362	u9014	m615	CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
L666203	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMmmm.
L666202	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
L666201	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMmmm.
L666200	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Love me oodles and oodles?
L666199	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMmmm.
L666198	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Still happy you married me?
L666197	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMmmm.
L666196	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
L666130	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
L666129	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMM!  MMMMM!
L666128	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Is it that music?
L666127	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMmm!
L666125	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
L666124	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMmmmm.
L666123	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
L666119	u9023	m615	MONSTER	Baack!
L666118	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	What?
L666117	u9023	m615	MONSTER	Baack!
L666116	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	What in God's name are you doing?
L665976	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	I...
L665975	u9019	m615	IGOR	Miss me?
L665974	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Well... yes.
L665973	u9019	m615	IGOR	Surprised?
L665972	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Hello...?
L665971	u9019	m615	IGOR	Darling!
L666017	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	That's my good boy.
L666016	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Good night.
L666015	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
L666014	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
L666013	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Is it worth taking a chance?
L666012	u9017	m615	FREDDY	That's a tough choice.
L666011	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
L666010	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
L666009	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
L666008	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
L666007	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
L666005	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
L666004	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
L666003	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
L666002	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
L666001	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
L666000	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
L665999	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Darling, you mustn't worry so.
L665998	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
L665986	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right then!
L665985	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	No, of course not.  I just meant...
L665984	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Are you suggesting I call him master???
L665983	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Why does he call you 'master'?
L665982	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
L665981	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	What a strange fellow.
L665979	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
L665978	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
L665977	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Ready, darling?
L665968	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
L665967	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Darling!?!
L665966	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
L665965	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Love me?
L665964	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Surprised!
L665963	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Surprised?
L665962	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Darling!
L665961	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Darling!
L665523	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Goodbye, darling!
L665522	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.
L665521	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.
L665520	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I will!  Goodbye, darling!
L665515	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You bet your boots it does.
L665514	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Does that mean you love me?
L665513	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You're incorrigible!
L665512	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
L665511	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Whatever makes you happy.
L665510	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	I hope you like large weddings.
L665509	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, nice.
L665508	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
L665507	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Very....very!
L665506	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Will you miss me?
L665503	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, darling -- so will I.
L665502	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
L665501	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I promise.
L665500	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Promise??
L665499	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes.
L665498	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Call me from New York before you leave??
L665497	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, don't worry.
L665496	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	And your passport?
L665495	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes.
L665494	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	You have your tickets?
L665493	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Of course.
L665492	u9015	m615	ELIZABETH	Darling!...you will be careful!?
L665956	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
L665955	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
L665954	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
L665614	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Good.
L665613	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
L665612	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
L665611	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	Will there be anything else?
L665610	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well... we'll see.
L665609	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	I think you must be mistaken, sir.
L665608	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
L665607	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	This is the only library I know of.
L665606	u9017	m615	FREDDY	well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
L665605	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	I don't know what you mean, sir.
L665604	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
L665603	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
L665602	u9017	m615	FREDDY	There seem to be quite a few books.
L665600	u9017	m615	FREDDY	May I have it, please?
L665599	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
L665598	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes!... the laboratory.
L665597	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	You mean... the laboratory??
L665596	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Does that include the key to the laboratory?
L665595	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
L665594	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It seems fine.
L665593	u9016	m615	FRAU BLUCHER	I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
L665491	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
L665490	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
L665489	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
L665488	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
L665487	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
L665486	u9017	m615	FREDDY	One week at the most!?
L665485	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
L665484	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
L665482	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
L665481	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I didn't do that.
L665480	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Break that old man's violin.
L665479	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What?
L665478	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Why did you do that?
L665477	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
L665466	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
L665465	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	A week.  Ten days at most.
L665464	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How long will this whole thing take?
L665463	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
L665462	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
L665461	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
L665459	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
L665458	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
L665457	u9018	m615	HERR FALKSTEIN	Dr. Frankenstein?
L665450	u9017	m615	FREDDY	My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
L665449	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But your grandfather's work, sir...
L665448	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
L665447	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
L665446	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But, sir...
L665445	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
L665444	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
L665443	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
L665442	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Nineteen, sir.
L665441	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How old are you, young man?
L665440	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
L665439	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
L665438	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
L665437	u9017	m615	FREDDY	My father was a sick man.
L665436	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
L665431	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
L665430	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Vermicelli.
L665429	u9017	m615	FREDDY	A piece of what?
L665428	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
L665427	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes?
L665426	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665425	u9017	m615	FREDDY	In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
L665394	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
L665393	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
L665392	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
L665391	u9017	m615	FREDDY	That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
L665390	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
L665389	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665388	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
L665387	u9017	m615	FREDDY	My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665386	u9022	m615	MEDICAL STUDENT	I beg your pardon?
L665385	u9017	m615	FREDDY	That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
L666138	u9019	m615	IGOR	Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
L666137	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's the only way.
L666136	u9019	m615	IGOR	Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
L666135	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Is everything ready?
L666134	u9019	m615	IGOR	Come on, big fellow!
L666104	u9019	m615	IGOR	I'll bet it's a doozy.
L666103	u9017	m615	FREDDY	There's only one way.
L666102	u9019	m615	IGOR	I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
L666101	u9017	m615	FREDDY	... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
L666100	u9019	m615	IGOR	That sound good, boss.
L666099	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
L666096	u9019	m615	IGOR	He's carrying her off now through the woods.
L666095	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What???
L666094	u9019	m615	IGOR	You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
L666091	u9019	m615	IGOR	"What d'ya mean ""What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement."
L666090	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What monster?
L665948	u9019	m615	IGOR	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
L665947	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm a failure.
L665907	u9019	m615	IGOR	That's what we're paid for.
L665906	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Thanks...for all your help.
L665884	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Maybe...if you get here on time.
L665883	u9019	m615	IGOR	Can you play it?
L665882	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
L665881	u9019	m615	IGOR	How do you know it was a 'she'?
L665880	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right -- where is she?
L665879	u9019	m615	IGOR	How do you know it was a 'he'?
L665878	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Where is he?
L665877	u9019	m615	IGOR	Someone was playing this in the music room.
L665876	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What did you find out?
L665875	u9019	m615	IGOR	How's it going?
L665855	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Act casual!
L665854	u9019	m615	IGOR	Yes, Master!
L665853	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
L665852	u9019	m615	IGOR	It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
L665835	u9017	m615	FREDDY	... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665834	u9019	m615	IGOR	No, no!  That whole thing!
L665833	u9017	m615	FREDDY	... I'm glad that's...
L665832	u9019	m615	IGOR	Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
L665831	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm not trying to be funny.
L665830	u9019	m615	IGOR	What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
L665829	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Why?
L665828	u9019	m615	IGOR	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
L665827	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes.
L665826	u9019	m615	IGOR	You can say that again.
L665825	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665824	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Give -- me -- your -- hand!
L665823	u9019	m615	IGOR	Original.
L665810	u9019	m615	IGOR	careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
L665809	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
L665808	u9019	m615	IGOR	Don't fall for that one.
L665807	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
L665806	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
L665805	u9019	m615	IGOR	Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
L665797	u9019	m615	IGOR	It wasn't me.
L665796	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But you did -- I just heard it.
L665795	u9019	m615	IGOR	I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
L665794	u9017	m615	FREDDY	To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
L665793	u9019	m615	IGOR	Who are you talking to?
L665792	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
L665789	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
L665788	u9019	m615	IGOR	I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
L665787	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
L665786	u9019	m615	IGOR	You'll be getting me sad next.
L665785	u9019	m615	IGOR	Well, I don't like to see you mope.
L665784	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Don't try to cheer me up that way.
L665783	u9019	m615	IGOR	You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
L665782	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Cold!  Cold and dead!
L665779	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
L665778	u9019	m615	IGOR	You can't win 'em all.
L665772	u9019	m615	IGOR	Wait till he sees the bill.
L665771	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Throw the third switch!
L665770	u9019	m615	IGOR	What?
L665769	u9017	m615	FREDDY	More, do you hear me?
L665768	u9019	m615	IGOR	What?
L665767	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
L665766	u9019	m615	IGOR	This guy means business.
L665765	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Throw the second switch!
L665761	u9019	m615	IGOR	You've got it, master.
L665760	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
L665759	u9019	m615	IGOR	Tonight?
L665758	u9017	m615	FREDDY	The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
L665754	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right... elevate me!
L665753	u9019	m615	IGOR	You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
L665747	u9019	m615	IGOR	Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
L665746	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
L665745	u9019	m615	IGOR	You're sure you know what you're doing?
L665736	u9019	m615	IGOR	Thank you, Master.
L665735	u9017	m615	FREDDY	If you like -- just hurry!
L665734	u9019	m615	IGOR	It's always been one of my favorite names.
L665733	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Why?
L665732	u9019	m615	IGOR	Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
L665731	u9017	m615	FREDDY	He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
L665730	u9019	m615	IGOR	I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
L665729	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Can you imagine that brain in this body?
L665728	u9019	m615	IGOR	That's not bad.
L665727	u9017	m615	FREDDY	And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
L665726	u9019	m615	IGOR	Hmm!
L665725	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
L665724	u9019	m615	IGOR	Was he any good?
L665723	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I want that brain.
L665722	u9019	m615	IGOR	Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
L665721	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Do you have the name I wrote down?
L665720	u9019	m615	IGOR	I have a pretty good idea.
L665719	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
L665714	u9019	m615	IGOR	Could be raining!
L665713	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How?
L665712	u9019	m615	IGOR	Could be worse!
L665711	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What a filthy job!
L665679	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
L665678	u9019	m615	IGOR	Taking the book along?
L665674	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
L665673	u9019	m615	IGOR	'How I Did It.'  Good title!
L665672	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
L665669	u9019	m615	IGOR	Must be the music room.
L665668	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What is this place?
L665662	u9019	m615	IGOR	No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
L665661	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Did you see anyone else down here?
L665656	u9019	m615	IGOR	Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
L665655	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
L665654	u9019	m615	IGOR	What?
L665653	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
L665650	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?
L665649	u9019	m615	IGOR	What?
L665648	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music??
L665647	u9019	m615	IGOR	What?
L665646	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?
L665645	u9019	m615	IGOR	Just putting up some tea.
L665644	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But what you were doing?
L665643	u9019	m615	IGOR	I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
L665642	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What are you doing here?
L665641	u9019	m615	IGOR	Fro-derick!
L665640	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Aye-gor!
L665585	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I wonder what's got into them?
L665584	u9019	m615	IGOR	Down!  Get down, you beasts!
L665580	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Home.
L665579	u9019	m615	IGOR	Home!
L665577	u9019	m615	IGOR	Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
L665576	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Wockers with the knockers???
L665575	u9019	m615	IGOR	The wockers with the knockers.
L665574	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What wockers?
L665573	u9019	m615	IGOR	Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
L665572	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No.
L665571	u9019	m615	IGOR	I thought you wanted to.
L665570	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Why are you talking like that?
L665569	u9019	m615	IGOR	There wolf!  There castle!
L665568	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I beg your pardon?
L665567	u9019	m615	IGOR	There.
L665562	u9019	m615	IGOR	What hump?
L665561	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
L665551	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, just the two.
L665550	u9019	m615	IGOR	Are these your bags?
L665547	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How do you do?
L665546	u9019	m615	IGOR	This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
L665545	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm sure we will.
L665544	u9019	m615	IGOR	Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
L665543	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
L665542	u9019	m615	IGOR	Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
L665541	u9017	m615	FREDDY	But they told me it was Ee gor.
L665540	u9019	m615	IGOR	No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
L665539	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You must be Igor.
L665538	u9019	m615	IGOR	I see.
L665537	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
L665536	u9019	m615	IGOR	Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
L665535	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No, Fred ereck.
L665534	u9019	m615	IGOR	And do you also say Fro dereck?
L665533	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665532	u9019	m615	IGOR	Are you putting me on?
L665531	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
L665530	u9019	m615	IGOR	Frederick Frankenstein?
L665945	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
L665944	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMmmmmmm.
L665943	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
L665942	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
L665939	u9017	m615	FREDDY	For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
L665938	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!

L665936	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
L665933	u9023	m615	MONSTER	Soo -- pah doo -- per.
L665932	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
L665931	u9023	m615	MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
L665930	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................

L665888	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMmmm!  MMmmm!

L665822	u9023	m615	MONSTER	... It's.
L665821	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
L665818	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
L665817	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
L665816	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
L665815	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMmmmmmmmm.
L665814	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How's everything?
L665813	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMMmmmmmmm.
L665812	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Hello there.
L665801	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's alive!
L665800	u9023	m615	MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
L665475	u9024	m615	OLD VIOLINIST	Ja, ja.
L665474	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
L665473	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, just a little.
L665472	u9024	m615	OLD VIOLINIST	It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
L665471	u9017	m615	FREDDY	May I see your violin?
L665470	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
L665469	u9024	m615	OLD VIOLINIST	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
L665468	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What's that tune that you're playing
L666222	u9017	m615	FREDDY	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
L666221	u9020	m615	INGA	Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
L666220	u9020	m615	INGA	I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
L666219	u9017	m615	FREDDY	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
L666218	u9020	m615	INGA	Ready for Fuchsmachen???
L666217	u9017	m615	FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
L666216	u9020	m615	INGA	Are you ready for me?
L666215	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
L666214	u9017	m615	FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
L666211	u9017	m615	FREDDY	MMmmm.
L666210	u9020	m615	INGA	All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
L666076	u9017	m615	FREDDY	...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
L666075	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes, I will.
L666074	u9017	m615	FREDDY	You've got to help me to remain faithful.
L666073	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes, I know.
L666072	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to her.
L666071	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes, I know.
L666045	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
L666044	u9020	m615	INGA	Why don't we talk inside?
L666043	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes...yes, you have yours.
L666042	u9020	m615	INGA	And I have mine.
L666041	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, I have mine.
L666040	u9020	m615	INGA	But, after all, you have yours.
L666039	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
L666038	u9020	m615	INGA	And Elizabeth has hers.
L666036	u9020	m615	INGA	We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
L666035	u9017	m615	FREDDY	No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
L666034	u9020	m615	INGA	Nor to Elizabeth.
L666033	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
L666032	u9020	m615	INGA	What?
L666030	u9020	m615	INGA	Of course not.
L666029	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
L666028	u9020	m615	INGA	I know Frederick.
L666027	u9017	m615	FREDDY	There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
L666026	u9020	m615	INGA	I see what you mean.
L666025	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
L666024	u9020	m615	INGA	Not fooling around.
L666023	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
L666022	u9020	m615	INGA	I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
L666021	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
L666020	u9020	m615	INGA	What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
L666019	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Just passing through the night.
L665958	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
L665957	u9020	m615	INGA	Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
L665905	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Good night!
L665904	u9020	m615	INGA	Good night, Doctor.
L665898	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
L665897	u9020	m615	INGA	I think so.
L665896	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Did you do it?
L665894	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
L665893	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Give him the sedative!
L665892	u9020	m615	INGA	Are you serious??
L665891	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right -- give it to him!
L665874	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Stop -- singing!!!
L665873	u9020	m615	INGA	It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
L665870	u9020	m615	INGA	It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
L665869	u9017	m615	FREDDY	This is not the finals -- just sing!
L665868	u9020	m615	INGA	I'd be so nervous.
L665867	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes -- quickly, dear!
L665866	u9020	m615	INGA	Me?  Sing?
L665865	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Do you think you can sing it?
L665862	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I think I'll...carry him.
L665861	u9020	m615	INGA	What are you going to do?
L665841	u9020	m615	INGA	What do you think we should do?
L665840	u9017	m615	FREDDY	It looks that way.
L665804	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
L665803	u9020	m615	INGA	I think you've done it, master.
L665802	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh, Doctor!
L665799	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
L665798	u9020	m615	INGA	It wasn't me.
L665777	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
L665776	u9020	m615	INGA	I thought it was wonderful.
L665775	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Reputation.  Reputation!
L665757	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
L665756	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Raise the platform, hurry!
L665755	u9020	m615	INGA	Right here?
L665752	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I know.
L665751	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes!
L665750	u9017	m615	FREDDY	A god?
L665749	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
L665748	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
L665693	u9017	m615	FREDDY	'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
L665692	u9020	m615	INGA	And look at this, Doctor!
L665691	u9017	m615	FREDDY	'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
L665677	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Perhaps we'd better leave.
L665676	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh, doctor!
L665665	u9020	m615	INGA	But who was playing it?
L665664	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well, this explains the music.
L665663	u9020	m615	INGA	Look, Doctor!
L665659	u9017	m615	FREDDY	What a filthy mess.
L665658	u9020	m615	INGA	Ooh!
L665639	u9017	m615	FREDDY	All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
L665638	u9020	m615	INGA	Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
L665637	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
L665636	u9020	m615	INGA	Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
L665633	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I don't know.  It just woke me up.
L665632	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
L665631	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
L665630	u9020	m615	INGA	What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
L665629	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Inga, wake up!
L665628	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
L665627	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Inga!
L665625	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
L665624	u9020	m615	INGA	No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
L665623	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Would you like a sandwich?
L665622	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
L665621	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
L665620	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Well...
L665619	u9020	m615	INGA	I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
L665618	u9017	m615	FREDDY	We only arrived a few minutes ago.
L665617	u9020	m615	INGA	Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
L665616	u9017	m615	FREDDY	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
L665615	u9020	m615	INGA	Are you busy?
L665565	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
L665564	u9020	m615	INGA	Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
L665559	u9017	m615	FREDDY	I'm not sure I...get your drift.
L665558	u9020	m615	INGA	Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
L665553	u9017	m615	FREDDY	Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
L665552	u9020	m615	INGA	Did you have a pleasant trip?
L665549	u9017	m615	FREDDY	How nice.
L665548	u9020	m615	INGA	Extremely well.
L666169	u9020	m615	INGA	Do Something!  Stall them!
L666168	u9019	m615	IGOR	Another fifteen seconds to go.
L666167	u9020	m615	INGA	Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
L666166	u9019	m615	IGOR	Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
L666161	u9019	m615	IGOR	Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
L666159	u9019	m615	IGOR	Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
L666158	u9020	m615	INGA	Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
L666156	u9020	m615	INGA	Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
L666155	u9019	m615	IGOR	What d'ya want to do to kill time?
L666154	u9020	m615	INGA	Yes.
L666153	u9019	m615	IGOR	Three minutes to go!
L666152	u9020	m615	INGA	Four
L666151	u9019	m615	IGOR	How long is it so far?
L666150	u9020	m615	INGA	The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
L666149	u9019	m615	IGOR	How do you know they're done?
L665952	u9019	m615	IGOR	Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
L665951	u9020	m615	INGA	I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
