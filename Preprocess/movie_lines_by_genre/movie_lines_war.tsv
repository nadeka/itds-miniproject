L64606	u473	m28	RODERICK	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
L64605	u454	m28	ARMED GENTLEMAN	Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
L64604	u473	m28	RODERICK	That is none of your business.
L64603	u454	m28	ARMED GENTLEMAN	Where are you bound for?
L64602	u473	m28	RODERICK	Good morning.
L64601	u454	m28	ARMED GENTLEMAN	Good day to you, young sir.
L64575	u463	m28	HARRY	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
L64574	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
L64573	u463	m28	HARRY	There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
L64530	u463	m28	HARRY	You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
L64529	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
L64528	u463	m28	HARRY	Both of us ride home with Best here.
L64524	u463	m28	HARRY	If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
L64523	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
L64501	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	I never was more in earnest.
L64500	u466	m28	MICHAEL	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
L64499	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
L64498	u466	m28	MICHAEL	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
L64497	u455	m28	CAPTAIN BEST	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
L64496	u466	m28	MICHAEL	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
L64828	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
L64827	u473	m28	RODERICK	And his baggage?
L64826	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
L64823	u473	m28	RODERICK	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
L64822	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Has he sent the challenge yet?
L64808	u473	m28	RODERICK	I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
L64807	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	What are the Chevalier's intentions?
L64769	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
L64768	u473	m28	RODERICK	Only a very little, as soldiers do.
L64767	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
L64764	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
L64763	u473	m28	RODERICK	What is the service, sir?
L64762	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
L64761	u473	m28	RODERICK	The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
L64760	u473	m28	RODERICK	How do you do, sir?
L64759	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
L64742	u473	m28	RODERICK	Neither!
L64741	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
L64740	u473	m28	RODERICK	Sir, I'm a British officer.
L64739	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	I have acted as I think fit.
L64738	u473	m28	RODERICK	Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
L64737	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
L64736	u473	m28	RODERICK	Where's the beauty you promised me?
L64733	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
L64732	u473	m28	RODERICK	The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
L64731	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
L64730	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
L64729	u473	m28	RODERICK	This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
L64728	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
L64726	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
L64725	u473	m28	RODERICK	O'Grady.
L64724	u456	m28	CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN	What is your uncle's name?
L64723	u473	m28	RODERICK	My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
L64692	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
L64691	u473	m28	RODERICK	The coward!
L64690	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
L64689	u473	m28	RODERICK	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
L64688	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
L64687	u473	m28	RODERICK	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
L64686	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
L64685	u473	m28	RODERICK	Is Miss Dugan well?
L64684	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
L64683	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	"We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to ""Brown Bess."""
L64682	u473	m28	RODERICK	I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
L64681	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
L64680	u473	m28	RODERICK	Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
L64572	u473	m28	RODERICK	A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
L64571	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
L64563	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	It must have been some other gate.
L64562	u473	m28	RODERICK	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
L64561	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
L64560	u473	m28	RODERICK	I'll match any man with the sword.
L64559	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
L64558	u473	m28	RODERICK	I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
L64557	u473	m28	RODERICK	I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
L64556	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
L64555	u473	m28	RODERICK	It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
L64554	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	That's a very handsome sword you have there.
L64552	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	Your cousins go out with him.
L64551	u473	m28	RODERICK	My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
L64550	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
L64549	u473	m28	RODERICK	Have you taken my message to him?
L64540	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
L64539	u473	m28	RODERICK	He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
L64538	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
L64537	u473	m28	RODERICK	Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
L64536	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
L64535	u473	m28	RODERICK	And so I am.
L64534	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
L64510	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
L64509	u473	m28	RODERICK	Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
L64506	u473	m28	RODERICK	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
L64505	u457	m28	CAPTAIN GROGAN	This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
L64661	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
L64660	u473	m28	RODERICK	Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
L64659	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
L64658	u473	m28	RODERICK	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
L64657	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
L64639	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	I have heard of them.
L64638	u473	m28	RODERICK	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
L64637	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
L64636	u473	m28	RODERICK	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
L64635	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
L64634	u473	m28	RODERICK	I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
L64633	u458	m28	CAPTAIN O'REILLY	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
L64803	u471	m28	PRINCE	I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
L64802	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
L64801	u471	m28	PRINCE	Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
L64800	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
L64799	u471	m28	PRINCE	I don't know.
L64798	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
L64797	u471	m28	PRINCE	Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
L64843	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
L64842	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	I have no luggage.
L64839	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	As you please.
L64838	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	All Europe shall hear of this!
L64837	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	Your honor must lower his voice.
L64836	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
L64835	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
L64834	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
L64833	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	You are going to drive to the frontier.
L64832	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Good gracious!  What is this?
L64831	u472	m28	PRUSSIAN OFFICER	I will let down the steps for your honor.
L64830	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
L64912	u473	m28	RODERICK	Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
L64911	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Certain?
L64910	u473	m28	RODERICK	I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
L64909	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
L64908	u473	m28	RODERICK	It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
L64874	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
L64873	u473	m28	RODERICK	When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
L64845	u473	m28	RODERICK	Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
L64844	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
L64819	u473	m28	RODERICK	But how, sir?
L64818	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
L64817	u473	m28	RODERICK	But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
L64816	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	I have faced that problem before.
L64815	u473	m28	RODERICK	I believe they will deport you.
L64814	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
L64813	u473	m28	RODERICK	But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
L64792	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
L64791	u473	m28	RODERICK	I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
L64790	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
L64788	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
L64787	u473	m28	RODERICK	And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
L64781	u473	m28	RODERICK	Only the agency of servants.
L64780	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Who else can give me information about you?
L64779	u473	m28	RODERICK	No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
L64778	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	For whom else have you worked?
L64777	u473	m28	RODERICK	Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
L64776	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
L64775	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, sir.
L64774	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
L64773	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
L64772	u459	m28	CHEVALIER	You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
L64901	u460	m28	COUNT	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
L64900	u473	m28	RODERICK	That is a trifle strong.
L64899	u460	m28	COUNT	Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
L64898	u473	m28	RODERICK	On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
L64897	u460	m28	COUNT	Then you yield to me.
L64896	u473	m28	RODERICK	Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
L64895	u460	m28	COUNT	Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
L64894	u473	m28	RODERICK	Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
L64893	u460	m28	COUNT	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
L65194	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Old fool!
L65193	u473	m28	RODERICK	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
L65164	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
L65163	u473	m28	RODERICK	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
L64992	u473	m28	RODERICK	"We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"""
L64991	u461	m28	COUNTESS	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
L64990	u473	m28	RODERICK	Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
L64989	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
L64986	u473	m28	RODERICK	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
L64985	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
L64984	u473	m28	RODERICK	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
L64983	u461	m28	COUNTESS	My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
L64982	u473	m28	RODERICK	Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
L64981	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
L64980	u473	m28	RODERICK	I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
L64979	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
L64978	u473	m28	RODERICK	Will we always leave it at this?
L64977	u473	m28	RODERICK	I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
L64976	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
L64975	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
L64974	u461	m28	COUNTESS	You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
L64973	u473	m28	RODERICK	Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
L64972	u461	m28	COUNTESS	And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
L64971	u473	m28	RODERICK	With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
L64970	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
L64969	u461	m28	COUNTESS	But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
L64968	u473	m28	RODERICK	Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
L64967	u461	m28	COUNTESS	The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
L64966	u473	m28	RODERICK	To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
L64965	u461	m28	COUNTESS	To make me wretched in two weeks.
L64964	u473	m28	RODERICK	It is my only object.
L64963	u461	m28	COUNTESS	You want my heart?
L64962	u473	m28	RODERICK	By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
L64961	u461	m28	COUNTESS	How so?
L64960	u473	m28	RODERICK	I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
L64959	u461	m28	COUNTESS	A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
L64958	u473	m28	RODERICK	I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
L64957	u461	m28	COUNTESS	It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
L64956	u473	m28	RODERICK	That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
L64955	u461	m28	COUNTESS	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
L64954	u473	m28	RODERICK	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
L64953	u461	m28	COUNTESS	"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."
L64952	u473	m28	RODERICK	Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
L64951	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
L64950	u473	m28	RODERICK	What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
L64949	u461	m28	COUNTESS	That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
L64948	u473	m28	RODERICK	Have you not a man whom you value?
L64947	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Not one.
L64946	u473	m28	RODERICK	How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
L64945	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Not even that.
L64944	u473	m28	RODERICK	But, for a time... a passing fancy?
L64943	u461	m28	COUNTESS	Never.
L64942	u473	m28	RODERICK	Have you had one?
L64941	u461	m28	COUNTESS	No.
L64494	u473	m28	RODERICK	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
L64493	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
L64472	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
L64471	u473	m28	RODERICK	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
L64470	u462	m28	DOROTHY	What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
L64469	u473	m28	RODERICK	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
L64468	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
L64467	u462	m28	DOROTHY	But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
L64466	u473	m28	RODERICK	If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
L64465	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
L64464	u473	m28	RODERICK	But you refused me, Dorothy.
L64463	u462	m28	DOROTHY	I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
L64462	u473	m28	RODERICK	Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
L64461	u462	m28	DOROTHY	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
L64460	u473	m28	RODERICK	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
L64452	u473	m28	RODERICK	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
L64451	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Why are you shaking?
L64450	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Then you must get it.
L64449	u473	m28	RODERICK	I feel the ribbon.
L64446	u473	m28	RODERICK	Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
L64445	u462	m28	DOROTHY	Agreed.
L64444	u473	m28	RODERICK	I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
L65079	u473	m28	RODERICK	All right, five hundred guineas.
L65078	u464	m28	HENRI	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
L65075	u473	m28	RODERICK	It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
L65074	u464	m28	HENRI	All the same, you must name an amount.
L65073	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
L65072	u464	m28	HENRI	As much as possible?
L65071	u473	m28	RODERICK	As much as possible.
L65070	u464	m28	HENRI	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
L65103	u465	m28	LORD WEST	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
L65102	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes!
L65101	u465	m28	LORD WEST	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
L65048	u465	m28	LORD WEST	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
L65047	u473	m28	RODERICK	By name only.
L65046	u465	m28	LORD WEST	Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
L65045	u473	m28	RODERICK	And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
L64825	u473	m28	RODERICK	What is to be done?
L64824	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	Then this must be done tomorrow.
L64821	u473	m28	RODERICK	When is he to go?
L64820	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
L64810	u473	m28	RODERICK	The Prince left him only that choice.
L64809	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
L64806	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	Hmm-mmmm.
L64805	u473	m28	RODERICK	In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
L64804	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	Was he cheated?
L64771	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
L64770	u467	m28	MINISTER GALGENSTEIN	Does this assignment interest you?
L64629	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
L64628	u473	m28	RODERICK	How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
L64627	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
L64626	u473	m28	RODERICK	As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
L64625	u473	m28	RODERICK	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
L64624	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
L64623	u473	m28	RODERICK	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
L64622	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
L64618	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
L64617	u473	m28	RODERICK	Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
L64614	u468	m28	MRS. O'REILLY	"Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him ""good luck."""
L64613	u473	m28	RODERICK	What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
L65179	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
L65178	u473	m28	RODERICK	I see.
L65177	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
L65176	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, of course.
L65175	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	May I be quite frank with you?
L65174	u473	m28	RODERICK	Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
L65173	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
L65172	u473	m28	RODERICK	I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
L65171	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
L65170	u473	m28	RODERICK	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
L65169	u469	m28	NEWCOMBE	I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
L65146	u470	m28	PATRICK	Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
L65145	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes, he's fine.
L65144	u470	m28	PATRICK	Is he all right, papa?
L65143	u473	m28	RODERICK	Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
L65133	u470	m28	PATRICK	Yes, papa.
L65132	u473	m28	RODERICK	I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
L65127	u473	m28	RODERICK	What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
L65126	u470	m28	PATRICK	One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
L65125	u473	m28	RODERICK	Yes?
L65124	u470	m28	PATRICK	Papa?
L65123	u473	m28	RODERICK	Good night, my little darling.
L65122	u470	m28	PATRICK	Good night, papa.
L65120	u473	m28	RODERICK	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
L65119	u470	m28	PATRICK	But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
L65118	u473	m28	RODERICK	Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
L65117	u470	m28	PATRICK	Did you buy the horse, papa?
L65006	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
L65005	u473	m28	RODERICK	Sir, let those laugh that win.
L65004	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
L65003	u473	m28	RODERICK	I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
L65002	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
L65001	u473	m28	RODERICK	Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
L65000	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
L64999	u473	m28	RODERICK	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
L64998	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
L64997	u473	m28	RODERICK	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
L64996	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
L64995	u473	m28	RODERICK	I beg your pardon?
L64994	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
L64993	u473	m28	RODERICK	Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
L64936	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
L64935	u473	m28	RODERICK	The milkmaid's daughter?
L64934	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
L64933	u473	m28	RODERICK	Would you have me spend my life all alone?
L64932	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
L64930	u474	m28	SIR WILLIAM	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
L64929	u473	m28	RODERICK	I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
L64888	u473	m28	RODERICK	Tender Hegenheim.
L64887	u475	m28	VALDEZ	He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
L64886	u473	m28	RODERICK	Will he wish to know the details of this night?
L64885	u475	m28	VALDEZ	He loves me, as I love you.
L64884	u473	m28	RODERICK	If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
L64883	u475	m28	VALDEZ	He is only curious to know who you are.
L64882	u473	m28	RODERICK	And he doesn't care about me?
L64881	u475	m28	VALDEZ	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
L64880	u473	m28	RODERICK	Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
L64879	u473	m28	RODERICK	Dark Valdez.
L64878	u473	m28	RODERICK	Black-eyed Sczortarska.
L64877	u473	m28	RODERICK	Charming Schuvaloff.
L109843	u628	m40	ARGYLE	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
L109842	u632	m40	LEADER	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
L109841	u628	m40	ARGYLE	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
L109840	u632	m40	LEADER	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
L109839	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
L109838	u632	m40	LEADER	Someone dead from this household?
L109855	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
L109854	u642	m40	WILLIAM	What are they doing?
L109851	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
L109850	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It was in Latin, sir.
L109849	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
L109848	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
L109847	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to leave.
L109846	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
L110416	u629	m40	CRAIG	He has already agreed to come.
L110415	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
L110414	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
L110413	u641	m40	WALLACE	So let the council swear publicly.
L110412	u629	m40	CRAIG	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
L110411	u641	m40	WALLACE	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
L110410	u629	m40	CRAIG	Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
L110300	u629	m40	CRAIG	It is suicide.
L110299	u641	m40	WALLACE	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
L110298	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot defeat this --
L110297	u641	m40	WALLACE	Peace?!
L110296	u629	m40	CRAIG	We must sue for peace.
L110295	u641	m40	WALLACE	A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
L110212	u629	m40	CRAIG	Invade?! That's impossible, it --
L110211	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
L110210	u629	m40	CRAIG	But... what will you do?
L110438	u629	m40	CRAIG	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
L110437	u639	m40	ROBERT	Longshanks promised!
L110428	u639	m40	ROBERT	He will. I know he will.
L110427	u629	m40	CRAIG	He won't come.
L110409	u629	m40	CRAIG	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
L110408	u639	m40	ROBERT	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
L110407	u629	m40	CRAIG	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
L110406	u639	m40	ROBERT	If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
L110403	u629	m40	CRAIG	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
L110402	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was a modest man.
L110401	u629	m40	CRAIG	May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
L110197	u629	m40	CRAIG	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
L110196	u639	m40	ROBERT	Does anyone know his politics?
L109897	u639	m40	ROBERT	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
L109896	u629	m40	CRAIG	A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
L109893	u629	m40	CRAIG	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
L109892	u639	m40	ROBERT	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
L109891	u629	m40	CRAIG	Young Robert, we are honored --
L110360	u630	m40	EDWARD	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
L110359	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
L110348	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
L110347	u630	m40	EDWARD	But if we have not caught Wallace --
L110346	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
L110345	u630	m40	EDWARD	The Scots will fight for us?
L110344	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
L110291	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
L110290	u630	m40	EDWARD	The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
L110241	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
L110240	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace has sacked York!
L110239	u630	m40	EDWARD	I have ordered conscriptions...
L110238	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
L110237	u630	m40	EDWARD	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
L110236	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What news of the north?
L110023	u630	m40	EDWARD	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
L110022	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
L110471	u630	m40	EDWARD	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
L110470	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
L110468	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
L110467	u630	m40	EDWARD	You fancy him.
L110466	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
L110436	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
L110435	u638	m40	PRINCESS	When will his trial be?
L110434	u630	m40	EDWARD	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
L110433	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Is it true? Wallace is captured?
L110370	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
L110369	u630	m40	EDWARD	The little cow is insane --
L110365	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
L110364	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's followers.
L110363	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
L110362	u630	m40	EDWARD	You mock us with a smile?
L110361	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Good day to you, M'Lords.
L109887	u630	m40	EDWARD	You may.
L109886	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
L109885	u630	m40	EDWARD	Now, my flower, do you understand?
L109884	u630	m40	EDWARD	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
L109883	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No, M'lord.
L109880	u630	m40	EDWARD	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
L109879	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
L109878	u630	m40	EDWARD	Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
L109876	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Scotland. He intends --
L109875	u630	m40	EDWARD	So I did! And what was so important about it?
L109874	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
L109873	u630	m40	EDWARD	What is it?!
L110426	u641	m40	WALLACE	No. One of us is enough.
L110425	u631	m40	HAMISH	Keep these. We're going too.
L110424	u641	m40	WALLACE	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
L110423	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
L110422	u641	m40	WALLACE	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
L110421	u631	m40	HAMISH	That's just a dream, William!
L110420	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
L110419	u631	m40	HAMISH	I don't want to be a martyr.
L110418	u641	m40	WALLACE	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
L110417	u631	m40	HAMISH	You know it's a trap.
L110398	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your rest is making me exhausted.
L110397	u641	m40	WALLACE	I rest.
L110396	u631	m40	HAMISH	Rest, William.
L110376	u631	m40	HAMISH	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
L110375	u641	m40	WALLACE	Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
L110317	u631	m40	HAMISH	Aye.
L110316	u641	m40	WALLACE	Stephen ready?
L110315	u641	m40	WALLACE	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
L110314	u631	m40	HAMISH	The Bruce is not coming, William.
L110052	u631	m40	HAMISH	Fourteen? --
L110051	u641	m40	WALLACE	We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
L110046	u641	m40	WALLACE	Hamish, I... thank...
L110045	u631	m40	HAMISH	I'll wait... back there.
L109927	u631	m40	HAMISH	I should'a remembered the eggs.
L109926	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Good to see you again.
L109916	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will not.
L109915	u631	m40	HAMISH	You'll move
L109913	u631	m40	HAMISH	I could crush you like a roach.
L109912	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
L109911	u631	m40	HAMISH	That depends on the man.
L109910	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
L109907	u642	m40	WILLIAM	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
L109906	u631	m40	HAMISH	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
L109905	u642	m40	WILLIAM	You win.
L109904	u631	m40	HAMISH	Test of manhood.
L109833	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Aye, we'll get 'em.
L109832	u631	m40	HAMISH	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
L109831	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I wanna have supper waitin'.
L109830	u631	m40	HAMISH	Wanna stay with me tonight?
L109828	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It's up to us, Hamish!
L109827	u631	m40	HAMISH	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
L109826	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
L109825	u631	m40	HAMISH	Armed?
L109824	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Three, maybe more!
L109823	u631	m40	HAMISH	How many?
L109822	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're coming!
L110089	u640	m40	STEPHEN	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
L110088	u631	m40	HAMISH	We don't split up!
L110087	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We must run in different directions!
L110069	u640	m40	STEPHEN	A patriot!
L110068	u631	m40	HAMISH	A common thief.
L110067	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
L110063	u640	m40	STEPHEN	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
L110062	u631	m40	HAMISH	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
L110061	u640	m40	STEPHEN	All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
L110355	u633	m40	LEPER	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
L110354	u639	m40	ROBERT	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
L110353	u633	m40	LEPER	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
L110352	u639	m40	ROBERT	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
L110351	u633	m40	LEPER	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
L110350	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
L110349	u633	m40	LEPER	I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
L110368	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
L110367	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Let her speak.
L110366	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have faced him. Have you?
L110289	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
L110288	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
L110287	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
L110286	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
L110284	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Humbly, M'lord.
L110283	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
L110282	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
L110281	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
L110280	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
L110279	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
L110278	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. He did not.
L110277	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
L109869	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
L109868	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Shall I leave, M'lord?
L109867	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
L109866	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
L109865	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Where is my son?
L110447	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
L110446	u641	m40	WALLACE	I do not confess.
L110445	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
L110444	u641	m40	WALLACE	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
L110443	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	It matters not, he is thy king!
L110442	u641	m40	WALLACE	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
L110441	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
L110440	u641	m40	WALLACE	Treason. Against whom?
L109978	u636	m40	MARION	...Tonight!
L109977	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Then when?
L109976	u636	m40	MARION	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
L109975	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Tonight then.
L109974	u636	m40	MARION	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
L109973	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I've missed you.
L109967	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
L109966	u636	m40	MARION	This night is too beautiful to have again.
L109965	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
L109964	u636	m40	MARION	You scare me.
L109963	u642	m40	WILLIAM	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
L109962	u636	m40	MARION	Nor I!
L109961	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'm not just saying it!
L109960	u636	m40	MARION	I... accept your proposal!
L109959	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I want... to marry you!
L109958	u642	m40	WILLIAM	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
L109957	u636	m40	MARION	Did it work?
L109956	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
L109955	u636	m40	MARION	You've been here before?
L109944	u636	m40	MARION	You are. And I'll come again.
L109943	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
L109942	u636	m40	MARION	Thank you for inviting.
L109941	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Thank you for accepting.
L109940	u636	m40	MARION	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
L109939	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Your father doesn't like me, does he?
L110083	u636	m40	MARION	Wake up, William. Wake up!
L110082	u641	m40	WALLACE	I need you so much! I love you!
L110081	u636	m40	MARION	And I with you. But you must wake.
L110080	u641	m40	WALLACE	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
L110079	u636	m40	MARION	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
L110078	u641	m40	WALLACE	I'm dreaming.
L110122	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...I wouldn't know.
L110121	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
L110120	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
L110119	u638	m40	PRINCESS	This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
L110118	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
L110117	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
L110116	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
L110115	u638	m40	PRINCESS	How do you know this?
L110114	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
L110465	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
L110464	u641	m40	WALLACE	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
L110463	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Drink this! It will dull your pain.
L110462	u641	m40	WALLACE	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
L110461	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You will die! It will be awful!
L110459	u641	m40	WALLACE	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
L110458	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
L110457	u641	m40	WALLACE	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
L110456	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
L110455	u641	m40	WALLACE	M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
L110393	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
L110392	u641	m40	WALLACE	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
L110391	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
L110390	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
L110389	u641	m40	WALLACE	You have... you have a husband.
L110386	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
L110385	u641	m40	WALLACE	Why did you?
L110380	u638	m40	PRINCESS	It does me good to see you.
L110379	u641	m40	WALLACE	A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
L110274	u641	m40	WALLACE	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
L110273	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
L110272	u641	m40	WALLACE	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
L110271	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Peace is made is such ways.
L110270	u641	m40	WALLACE	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
L110269	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
L110260	u638	m40	PRINCESS	That is not possible.
L110259	u641	m40	WALLACE	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
L110258	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
L110257	u641	m40	WALLACE	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
L110256	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
L110255	u638	m40	PRINCESS	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
L110254	u641	m40	WALLACE	It's battle I want, not talk.
L110253	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
L110252	u641	m40	WALLACE	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
L110251	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am the Princess of Wales.
L110309	u641	m40	WALLACE	And I will consult with mine.
L110308	u639	m40	ROBERT	I must... consult with my father.
L110307	u641	m40	WALLACE	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
L110306	u639	m40	ROBERT	I am trying.
L110305	u641	m40	WALLACE	War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
L110220	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
L110219	u639	m40	ROBERT	I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
L110218	u641	m40	WALLACE	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
L110217	u639	m40	ROBERT	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
L110216	u641	m40	WALLACE	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
L110215	u639	m40	ROBERT	Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
L110400	u641	m40	WALLACE	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
L110399	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Come, it'll help you sleep.
L110156	u641	m40	WALLACE	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
L110155	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Fine speech. Now what do we do?
L110107	u641	m40	WALLACE	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
L110106	u640	m40	STEPHEN	I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
L110099	u641	m40	WALLACE	Exactly.
L110098	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Who would do such a thing?
L110097	u641	m40	WALLACE	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
L110096	u640	m40	STEPHEN	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
L110095	u641	m40	WALLACE	They've tricked us.
L110094	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We can't stop!
L119167	u667	m42	RICK	-- He's just a lucky guy.
L119166	u658	m42	ANNINA	Monsieur Rick, I --
L119142	u667	m42	RICK	Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
L119141	u658	m42	ANNINA	Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
L119140	u667	m42	RICK	Go back to Bulgaria.
L119139	u658	m42	ANNINA	Oh, yes, please.
L119138	u667	m42	RICK	You want my advice?
L119137	u658	m42	ANNINA	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
L119136	u667	m42	RICK	Nobody ever loved me that much.
L119134	u667	m42	RICK	He always has.
L119133	u658	m42	ANNINA	-- Will he keep his word?
L119132	u667	m42	RICK	And you want to know --
L119131	u658	m42	ANNINA	Yes, Monsieur.
L119130	u667	m42	RICK	And he is still willing to give you a visa?
L119129	u658	m42	ANNINA	Oh, yes.
L119128	u667	m42	RICK	Does he know that?
L119127	u658	m42	ANNINA	He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
L119126	u667	m42	RICK	Yes, I'll bet.
L119125	u658	m42	ANNINA	Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
L119124	u667	m42	RICK	So you decided to go to America.
L119123	u658	m42	ANNINA	Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
L119122	u667	m42	RICK	How long have you been married?
L119121	u658	m42	ANNINA	At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
L119120	u667	m42	RICK	I thought so. Where's your husband?
L119119	u658	m42	ANNINA	He did. Captain Renault did.
L119118	u667	m42	RICK	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
L119117	u658	m42	ANNINA	No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
L119116	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
L119115	u658	m42	ANNINA	Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
L119114	u658	m42	ANNINA	No.
L119113	u667	m42	RICK	No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
L119112	u667	m42	RICK	He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
L119111	u658	m42	ANNINA	My husband is with me, too.
L119110	u667	m42	RICK	I should have known.
L119109	u658	m42	ANNINA	I came with Captain Renault.
L119108	u667	m42	RICK	How did you get in here? You're under age.
L119107	u658	m42	ANNINA	Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
L119106	u667	m42	RICK	Yes?
L119105	u658	m42	ANNINA	Monsieur Rick?
L118725	u659	m42	BERGER	But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
L118724	u665	m42	LASZLO	I see.
L118722	u665	m42	LASZLO	As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
L118721	u659	m42	BERGER	We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
L118720	u665	m42	LASZLO	In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
L118719	u659	m42	BERGER	I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
L118718	u665	m42	LASZLO	A champagne cocktail, please.
L118717	u659	m42	BERGER	Yes, Monsieur.
L118716	u665	m42	LASZLO	Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
L118674	u665	m42	LASZLO	I'm sorry. It is.
L118673	u659	m42	BERGER	Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
L118670	u659	m42	BERGER	Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
L118669	u665	m42	LASZLO	What is your name?
L118668	u659	m42	BERGER	Good.
L118666	u659	m42	BERGER	-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
L118665	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you, but I hardly think --
L118664	u659	m42	BERGER	You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
L118663	u665	m42	LASZLO	Well?
L118662	u659	m42	BERGER	Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
L119329	u660	m42	CARL	Yes, sir.
L119328	u667	m42	RICK	I want you to take Miss Lund home.
L119327	u660	m42	CARL	Yes, I come, I will do it.
L119326	u667	m42	RICK	-- Tonight he forgot.
L119325	u660	m42	CARL	But Sacha always puts out that light --
L119324	u667	m42	RICK	I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
L119323	u660	m42	CARL	Yes, I come.
L119322	u667	m42	RICK	Come up here a minute.
L119321	u660	m42	CARL	The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
L119269	u660	m42	CARL	Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
L119268	u667	m42	RICK	Goodnight.
L119267	u660	m42	CARL	I won't.
L119266	u667	m42	RICK	-- Don't tell me where you're going.
L119265	u660	m42	CARL	I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
L119264	u667	m42	RICK	Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
L119263	u660	m42	CARL	Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
L119262	u667	m42	RICK	Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
L119261	u660	m42	CARL	Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
L119260	u667	m42	RICK	How long can I afford to stay closed?
L119259	u660	m42	CARL	Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
L119170	u660	m42	CARL	Monsieur Rick!
L119169	u667	m42	RICK	No thanks, Carl.
L119168	u660	m42	CARL	Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
L118537	u667	m42	RICK	That's all right.
L118536	u661	m42	EMIL	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
L118535	u667	m42	RICK	Here you are.
L118523	u661	m42	EMIL	I'm awfully sorry.
L118522	u667	m42	RICK	-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
L118521	u661	m42	EMIL	I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
L118520	u667	m42	RICK	Well, I'll get it from the safe.
L118519	u661	m42	EMIL	Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
L119051	u662	m42	EUROPEAN	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
L119050	u670	m42	TOURIST	Er, goodbye, sir.
L119048	u662	m42	EUROPEAN	I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
L119047	u670	m42	TOURIST	Er, my check, please.
L119046	u662	m42	EUROPEAN	I'd better be going.
L119045	u670	m42	TOURIST	Er, good luck, yes.
L119044	u662	m42	EUROPEAN	Here's to you, sir.
L119387	u663	m42	FERRARI	I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
L119386	u667	m42	RICK	Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
L119385	u667	m42	RICK	Well, so long.
L119384	u663	m42	FERRARI	Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
L119383	u667	m42	RICK	And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
L119382	u663	m42	FERRARI	Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
L119381	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
L119380	u663	m42	FERRARI	Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
L119379	u667	m42	RICK	It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
L119378	u663	m42	FERRARI	Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
L118984	u663	m42	FERRARI	Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
L118983	u667	m42	RICK	That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
L118982	u667	m42	RICK	Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
L118981	u663	m42	FERRARI	Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
L118980	u667	m42	RICK	I'll tell him when he comes in.
L118979	u663	m42	FERRARI	Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
L118978	u667	m42	RICK	And the carrying charges?
L118977	u663	m42	FERRARI	I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
L118976	u667	m42	RICK	So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
L118975	u663	m42	FERRARI	If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
L118974	u667	m42	RICK	Practically no one.
L118973	u663	m42	FERRARI	Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
L118972	u667	m42	RICK	You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
L118971	u663	m42	FERRARI	The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
L118970	u663	m42	FERRARI	Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
L118969	u667	m42	RICK	I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
L118968	u663	m42	FERRARI	No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
L118967	u667	m42	RICK	I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
L118473	u663	m42	FERRARI	My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
L118472	u667	m42	RICK	Suppose we do.
L118471	u663	m42	FERRARI	Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
L118470	u667	m42	RICK	Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
L118469	u663	m42	FERRARI	That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
L118468	u667	m42	RICK	I don't buy or sell human beings.
L118467	u663	m42	FERRARI	What do you want for Sam?
L118466	u667	m42	RICK	It's not for sale at any price.
L118465	u663	m42	FERRARI	You haven't heard my offer.
L118464	u667	m42	RICK	It's not for sale.
L118463	u663	m42	FERRARI	Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
L118462	u667	m42	RICK	Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
L118461	u663	m42	FERRARI	Hello, Rick.
L119043	u665	m42	LASZLO	Good day.
L119042	u663	m42	FERRARI	It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
L119040	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you very much. Good day.
L119039	u663	m42	FERRARI	He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
L119038	u665	m42	LASZLO	Rick?
L119037	u663	m42	FERRARI	Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
L119036	u665	m42	LASZLO	Do you know where they are?
L119035	u663	m42	FERRARI	Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
L119034	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes, something.
L119033	u663	m42	FERRARI	I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
L119031	u663	m42	FERRARI	Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
L119030	u665	m42	LASZLO	We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
L119018	u663	m42	FERRARI	-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
L119017	u665	m42	LASZLO	I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
L119014	u665	m42	LASZLO	Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
L119013	u663	m42	FERRARI	As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
L119012	u665	m42	LASZLO	You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
L119229	u669	m42	STRASSER	My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
L119228	u664	m42	ILSA	And the other alternative?
L119227	u669	m42	STRASSER	It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
L119226	u664	m42	ILSA	What are they?
L119225	u669	m42	STRASSER	There are only two other alternatives for him.
L119224	u664	m42	ILSA	What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
L119223	u669	m42	STRASSER	Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
L119222	u664	m42	ILSA	Occupied France?
L119221	u669	m42	STRASSER	That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
L119220	u664	m42	ILSA	This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
L119219	u669	m42	STRASSER	Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
L118929	u664	m42	ILSA	You needn't be concerned about me.
L118928	u669	m42	STRASSER	And Mademoiselle?
L119471	u667	m42	RICK	She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
L119470	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes.
L119462	u667	m42	RICK	And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
L119461	u664	m42	ILSA	And I said I would never leave you.
L119460	u667	m42	RICK	We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
L119459	u664	m42	ILSA	But what about us?
L119458	u667	m42	RICK	Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
L119457	u664	m42	ILSA	No.
L119456	u667	m42	RICK	I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
L119453	u667	m42	RICK	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
L119452	u664	m42	ILSA	But Richard, no, I, I --
L119451	u667	m42	RICK	-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
L119450	u664	m42	ILSA	No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
L119449	u667	m42	RICK	I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
L119448	u664	m42	ILSA	I don't understand. What about you?
L119447	u667	m42	RICK	Because you're getting on that plane.
L119446	u664	m42	ILSA	But why my name, Richard?
L119406	u664	m42	ILSA	Oh, Rick!
L119405	u667	m42	RICK	Everything is quite all right.
L119404	u664	m42	ILSA	But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
L119403	u667	m42	RICK	No, not yet.
L119402	u664	m42	ILSA	Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
L119313	u664	m42	ILSA	I wish I didn't love you so much.
L119312	u667	m42	RICK	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
L119311	u664	m42	ILSA	I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
L119310	u667	m42	RICK	All except one. He won't have you.
L119309	u664	m42	ILSA	Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
L119308	u667	m42	RICK	And Laszlo?
L119307	u664	m42	ILSA	Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
L119306	u667	m42	RICK	Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
L119305	u664	m42	ILSA	Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
L119304	u667	m42	RICK	When did you first find out he was alive?
L119303	u664	m42	ILSA	Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
L119302	u667	m42	RICK	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
L119301	u664	m42	ILSA	"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."
L119300	u667	m42	RICK	And then?
L119296	u667	m42	RICK	If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
L119295	u664	m42	ILSA	For the last time, put them on the table.
L119294	u667	m42	RICK	No.
L119293	u664	m42	ILSA	Put them on the table.
L119292	u667	m42	RICK	I don't have to. I've got them right here.
L119291	u664	m42	ILSA	-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
L119289	u667	m42	RICK	What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
L119288	u664	m42	ILSA	No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
L119286	u667	m42	RICK	-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
L119285	u664	m42	ILSA	Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
L119284	u667	m42	RICK	-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
L119283	u664	m42	ILSA	Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
L119282	u667	m42	RICK	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
L119281	u664	m42	ILSA	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
L119280	u667	m42	RICK	Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
L119279	u664	m42	ILSA	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
L119278	u667	m42	RICK	I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
L119277	u664	m42	ILSA	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
L119276	u667	m42	RICK	Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
L119275	u664	m42	ILSA	Please.
L119274	u667	m42	RICK	"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
L119273	u664	m42	ILSA	Richard, I had to see you.
L119272	u667	m42	RICK	I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
L119271	u664	m42	ILSA	The stairs from the street.
L119270	u667	m42	RICK	How did you get in?
L119009	u664	m42	ILSA	No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
L119008	u667	m42	RICK	All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
L119007	u667	m42	RICK	Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
L119006	u664	m42	ILSA	You can believe that if you want to.
L119005	u667	m42	RICK	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
L119004	u664	m42	ILSA	Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
L119003	u667	m42	RICK	Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
L119002	u664	m42	ILSA	I don't think I will, Rick.
L119001	u667	m42	RICK	Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
L119000	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes.
L118999	u667	m42	RICK	Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
L118993	u664	m42	ILSA	It doesn't matter.
L118992	u667	m42	RICK	I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
L118909	u667	m42	RICK	"Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?"
L118908	u664	m42	ILSA	It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
L118907	u667	m42	RICK	Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
L118906	u664	m42	ILSA	I don't know the finish yet.
L118905	u667	m42	RICK	Has it got a wow finish?
L118904	u664	m42	ILSA	Can I tell you a story, Rick?
L118903	u667	m42	RICK	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
L118902	u664	m42	ILSA	I didn't count the days.
L118901	u667	m42	RICK	Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
L118900	u664	m42	ILSA	Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
L118899	u667	m42	RICK	"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""
L118898	u664	m42	ILSA	I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
L118897	u667	m42	RICK	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
L118896	u664	m42	ILSA	Please.
L118895	u667	m42	RICK	Especially tonight.
L118894	u664	m42	ILSA	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
L118893	u667	m42	RICK	Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
L118887	u664	m42	ILSA	I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
L118886	u667	m42	RICK	Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
L118885	u664	m42	ILSA	Oh, darling!
L118884	u667	m42	RICK	Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
L118883	u664	m42	ILSA	That's too far ahead to plan.
L118882	u667	m42	RICK	All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
L118881	u664	m42	ILSA	No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
L118880	u667	m42	RICK	-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
L118879	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes, of course, we --
L118878	u667	m42	RICK	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
L118877	u664	m42	ILSA	But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
L118876	u667	m42	RICK	I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
L118875	u664	m42	ILSA	Strange. I know so very little about you.
L118871	u667	m42	RICK	Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
L118870	u664	m42	ILSA	Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
L118869	u667	m42	RICK	Looking for a job.
L118868	u664	m42	ILSA	Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
L118867	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
L118866	u664	m42	ILSA	With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
L118865	u664	m42	ILSA	It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
L118864	u667	m42	RICK	My German's a little rusty.
L118860	u667	m42	RICK	I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
L118859	u664	m42	ILSA	Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
L118857	u664	m42	ILSA	Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
L118856	u667	m42	RICK	"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
L118855	u664	m42	ILSA	That's easy. There was. He's dead.
L118854	u667	m42	RICK	Uh huh.
L118853	u664	m42	ILSA	Why there is no other man in my life?
L118852	u667	m42	RICK	Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
L118851	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes?
L118850	u667	m42	RICK	And I was wondering.
L118849	u664	m42	ILSA	I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
L118848	u667	m42	RICK	In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
L118847	u664	m42	ILSA	A franc for your thoughts.
L118846	u667	m42	RICK	Here's looking at you, kid.
L118845	u664	m42	ILSA	"We said ""no questions."""
L118844	u667	m42	RICK	Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
L118799	u667	m42	RICK	He hasn't played it in a long time.
L118798	u664	m42	ILSA	"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."
L118797	u667	m42	RICK	I will.
L118796	u664	m42	ILSA	Say goodnight to Sam for me.
L118785	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
L118784	u667	m42	RICK	I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
L118783	u664	m42	ILSA	No.
L118782	u667	m42	RICK	Not an easy day to forget.
L118781	u664	m42	ILSA	How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
L118780	u667	m42	RICK	"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""
L118752	u668	m42	SAM	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
L118751	u664	m42	ILSA	"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
L118750	u668	m42	SAM	I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
L118749	u664	m42	ILSA	Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
L118748	u668	m42	SAM	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
L118747	u664	m42	ILSA	You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
L118746	u668	m42	SAM	Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
L118745	u664	m42	ILSA	Does he always leave so early?
L118744	u668	m42	SAM	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
L118743	u664	m42	ILSA	When will he be back?
L118742	u668	m42	SAM	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
L118741	u664	m42	ILSA	Where is Rick?
L118740	u668	m42	SAM	Yes, ma'am.
L118739	u664	m42	ILSA	Some of the old songs, Sam.
L118738	u668	m42	SAM	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
L118737	u664	m42	ILSA	It's been a long time.
L118736	u668	m42	SAM	Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
L118735	u664	m42	ILSA	Hello, Sam.
L119477	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
L119476	u665	m42	LASZLO	Are you ready Ilsa?
L119258	u665	m42	LASZLO	Of course, I'll be careful.
L119257	u664	m42	ILSA	Be careful.
L119254	u665	m42	LASZLO	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
L119253	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
L119252	u665	m42	LASZLO	I love you very much, my dear.
L119251	u664	m42	ILSA	No, Victor, there isn't.
L119250	u665	m42	LASZLO	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
L119249	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes, Victor, I was.
L119248	u665	m42	LASZLO	When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
L119247	u664	m42	ILSA	-- Yes?
L119246	u665	m42	LASZLO	Ilsa, I --
L119244	u665	m42	LASZLO	"Yes. He said, ""Ask your wife."" I don't know why he said that."
L119243	u664	m42	ILSA	Ask me?
L119242	u665	m42	LASZLO	He suggested I ask you.
L119241	u664	m42	ILSA	Did he give any reason?
L119240	u665	m42	LASZLO	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
L119239	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes?
L119238	u665	m42	LASZLO	Apparently he has the letters.
L119237	u664	m42	ILSA	Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
L119236	u665	m42	LASZLO	To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
L119235	u664	m42	ILSA	Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
L119234	u665	m42	LASZLO	I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
L119233	u664	m42	ILSA	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
L119232	u665	m42	LASZLO	Our faithful friend is still there.
L119231	u665	m42	LASZLO	We'll discuss it later.
L119230	u664	m42	ILSA	What happened with Rick?
L119148	u665	m42	LASZLO	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
L119147	u664	m42	ILSA	He does. Could we have a table close to him?
L119027	u665	m42	LASZLO	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
L119026	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
L119025	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes, I would.
L119024	u664	m42	ILSA	But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
L119023	u665	m42	LASZLO	No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
L119021	u664	m42	ILSA	No, Victor, no.
L119020	u665	m42	LASZLO	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
L119019	u664	m42	ILSA	We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
L118809	u665	m42	LASZLO	Goodnight.
L118808	u664	m42	ILSA	Goodnight.
L118801	u665	m42	LASZLO	Goodnight.
L118800	u664	m42	ILSA	Goodnight.
L118715	u665	m42	LASZLO	I will, don't worry.
L118714	u664	m42	ILSA	Be careful.
L118713	u665	m42	LASZLO	I must find out what Berger knows.
L118712	u665	m42	LASZLO	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
L118711	u664	m42	ILSA	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
L118710	u665	m42	LASZLO	This time they really mean to stop me.
L118683	u665	m42	LASZLO	Won't you join us?
L118682	u664	m42	ILSA	You are very kind.
L118661	u665	m42	LASZLO	If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
L118660	u664	m42	ILSA	Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
L119455	u664	m42	ILSA	You're saying this only to make me go.
L119454	u666	m42	RENAULT	I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
L118779	u664	m42	ILSA	I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
L118778	u666	m42	RENAULT	I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
L118763	u664	m42	ILSA	-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
L118762	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well then, perhaps you also ---
L118761	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
L118760	u664	m42	ILSA	Hello, Rick.
L118695	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
L118694	u664	m42	ILSA	-- Is what?
L118693	u666	m42	RENAULT	Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
L118692	u664	m42	ILSA	Rick? Who's he?
L118691	u666	m42	RENAULT	He came from Paris with Rick.
L118690	u664	m42	ILSA	Yes.
L118689	u666	m42	RENAULT	Sam?
L118688	u664	m42	ILSA	Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
L119473	u667	m42	RICK	Here it is.
L119472	u665	m42	LASZLO	I understand.
L119469	u667	m42	RICK	But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
L119468	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes.
L119467	u667	m42	RICK	I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
L119466	u665	m42	LASZLO	Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
L119465	u667	m42	RICK	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
L119464	u665	m42	LASZLO	Everything in order?
L119416	u667	m42	RICK	Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
L119415	u665	m42	LASZLO	No. It's all arranged.
L119414	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
L119413	u665	m42	LASZLO	But we made a deal.
L119412	u667	m42	RICK	Keep it. You'll need it in America.
L119411	u665	m42	LASZLO	I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
L119410	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
L119409	u665	m42	LASZLO	Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
L119344	u665	m42	LASZLO	Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
L119343	u667	m42	RICK	You love her that much?
L119342	u665	m42	LASZLO	I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
L119341	u667	m42	RICK	You seem to know all about my destiny.
L119340	u665	m42	LASZLO	I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
L119339	u667	m42	RICK	Yes, I get the point.
L119338	u665	m42	LASZLO	You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
L119337	u667	m42	RICK	What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
L119336	u665	m42	LASZLO	We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
L119335	u667	m42	RICK	Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
L119334	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes, rather.
L119333	u667	m42	RICK	Had a close one, eh?
L119332	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you.
L119331	u667	m42	RICK	Well, this might come in handy.
L119203	u665	m42	LASZLO	My wife?
L119202	u667	m42	RICK	I said, ask your wife.
L119201	u665	m42	LASZLO	I beg your pardon?
L119200	u667	m42	RICK	There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
L119199	u665	m42	LASZLO	There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
L119198	u667	m42	RICK	My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
L119197	u665	m42	LASZLO	I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
L119196	u667	m42	RICK	I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
L119195	u665	m42	LASZLO	Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
L119194	u667	m42	RICK	Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
L119193	u665	m42	LASZLO	Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
L119192	u667	m42	RICK	What of it?
L119191	u665	m42	LASZLO	My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
L119190	u667	m42	RICK	I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
L119189	u665	m42	LASZLO	You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
L119188	u665	m42	LASZLO	Right.
L119187	u667	m42	RICK	My office.
L119186	u665	m42	LASZLO	Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
L119185	u667	m42	RICK	Go ahead.
L119184	u665	m42	LASZLO	Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
L119146	u667	m42	RICK	I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
L119145	u665	m42	LASZLO	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
L119144	u667	m42	RICK	Good evening.
L118987	u667	m42	RICK	Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
L118986	u665	m42	LASZLO	Good morning.
L118795	u667	m42	RICK	Any time.
L118794	u665	m42	LASZLO	We'll come again.
L118790	u667	m42	RICK	Not at all.
L118789	u665	m42	LASZLO	I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
L118777	u667	m42	RICK	We all try. You succeed.
L118776	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you. I try.
L118775	u667	m42	RICK	Your work.
L118774	u665	m42	LASZLO	What for?
L118773	u667	m42	RICK	And I congratulate you.
L118768	u665	m42	LASZLO	Won't you join us for a drink?
L118767	u667	m42	RICK	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
L118766	u665	m42	LASZLO	One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
L118765	u667	m42	RICK	How do you do?
L118764	u665	m42	LASZLO	How do you do?
L118952	u665	m42	LASZLO	Are you quite finished with us?
L118951	u666	m42	RENAULT	I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
L118948	u665	m42	LASZLO	Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
L118947	u666	m42	RENAULT	I believe you have a message for him?
L118946	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes.
L118945	u666	m42	RENAULT	By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
L118944	u665	m42	LASZLO	-- Thank you.
L118943	u666	m42	RENAULT	Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
L118937	u665	m42	LASZLO	I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
L118936	u666	m42	RENAULT	And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
L118927	u665	m42	LASZLO	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
L118926	u666	m42	RENAULT	I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
L118922	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you.
L118921	u666	m42	RENAULT	With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
L118920	u665	m42	LASZLO	May we proceed with the business?
L118919	u666	m42	RENAULT	That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
L118918	u665	m42	LASZLO	I slept very well.
L118917	u666	m42	RENAULT	I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
L118807	u666	m42	RENAULT	Goodnight.
L118806	u665	m42	LASZLO	We'll be there.
L118805	u666	m42	RENAULT	Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
L118788	u666	m42	RENAULT	So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
L118787	u665	m42	LASZLO	Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
L118786	u666	m42	RENAULT	Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
L118772	u665	m42	LASZLO	This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
L118771	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
L118733	u666	m42	RENAULT	No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
L118732	u665	m42	LASZLO	My bill.
L118706	u665	m42	LASZLO	Very well.
L118705	u666	m42	RENAULT	Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
L118687	u666	m42	RENAULT	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
L118686	u665	m42	LASZLO	No, Captain, please.
L118681	u666	m42	RENAULT	I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
L118680	u665	m42	LASZLO	Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
L118679	u666	m42	RENAULT	Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
L118678	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes. What is it you want?
L118677	u666	m42	RENAULT	I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
L118676	u665	m42	LASZLO	Yes.
L118675	u666	m42	RENAULT	Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
L118954	u665	m42	LASZLO	Good day.
L118953	u669	m42	STRASSER	For the time being.
L118942	u665	m42	LASZLO	You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
L118941	u669	m42	STRASSER	Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
L118940	u665	m42	LASZLO	And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
L118939	u665	m42	LASZLO	"If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now."
L118938	u669	m42	STRASSER	You will give us the names?
L118935	u669	m42	STRASSER	Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
L118934	u665	m42	LASZLO	Even in Berlin.
L118933	u669	m42	STRASSER	You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
L118932	u665	m42	LASZLO	And that is?
L118931	u669	m42	STRASSER	Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
L118930	u665	m42	LASZLO	Is that all you wish to tell us?
L118925	u669	m42	STRASSER	Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
L118924	u665	m42	LASZLO	Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
L118923	u669	m42	STRASSER	Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
L118704	u665	m42	LASZLO	Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
L118703	u669	m42	STRASSER	Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
L118702	u665	m42	LASZLO	This is hardly the time or the place.
L118701	u669	m42	STRASSER	I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
L118700	u665	m42	LASZLO	I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
L118699	u669	m42	STRASSER	You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
L118698	u665	m42	LASZLO	I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
L119488	u666	m42	RENAULT	Ask Monsieur Rick.
L119487	u669	m42	STRASSER	Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
L119486	u666	m42	RENAULT	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
L119485	u669	m42	STRASSER	What is the meaning of that phone call?
L119212	u669	m42	STRASSER	Find one.
L119211	u666	m42	RENAULT	But I have no excuse to close it.
L119210	u669	m42	STRASSER	Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
L119209	u666	m42	RENAULT	But everybody's having such a good time.
L119208	u669	m42	STRASSER	You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
L119086	u666	m42	RENAULT	I see what you mean.
L119085	u669	m42	STRASSER	Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
L119084	u666	m42	RENAULT	A leader, like Laszlo?
L119083	u669	m42	STRASSER	We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
L119081	u669	m42	STRASSER	And if it should change?
L119080	u666	m42	RENAULT	I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
L119079	u669	m42	STRASSER	Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
L119078	u666	m42	RENAULT	My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
L119077	u669	m42	STRASSER	You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
L118915	u666	m42	RENAULT	It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
L118914	u669	m42	STRASSER	As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
L118913	u666	m42	RENAULT	"But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918."
L118912	u669	m42	STRASSER	You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
L118911	u666	m42	RENAULT	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
L118910	u669	m42	STRASSER	I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
L118708	u669	m42	STRASSER	Mademoiselle.
L118707	u666	m42	RENAULT	Mademoiselle.
L118653	u669	m42	STRASSER	Perhaps.
L118652	u666	m42	RENAULT	You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
L118649	u669	m42	STRASSER	I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
L118648	u666	m42	RENAULT	Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
L118638	u669	m42	STRASSER	You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
L118637	u666	m42	RENAULT	Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
L118633	u669	m42	STRASSER	How about New York?
L118632	u666	m42	RENAULT	Ho, diplomatist!
L118620	u669	m42	STRASSER	Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
L118619	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
L118618	u669	m42	STRASSER	"You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."
L118613	u669	m42	STRASSER	How do you do, Mr. Rick?
L118612	u666	m42	RENAULT	Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
L118594	u669	m42	STRASSER	I expected no less, Captain.
L118593	u666	m42	RENAULT	Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
L118590	u669	m42	STRASSER	Thank you.
L118589	u666	m42	RENAULT	May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
L118588	u669	m42	STRASSER	Champagne and a tin of caviar.
L118587	u666	m42	RENAULT	Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
L118585	u669	m42	STRASSER	Good evening, Captain.
L118584	u666	m42	RENAULT	Good evening, gentlemen.
L118397	u669	m42	STRASSER	I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
L118396	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
L118393	u666	m42	RENAULT	Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
L118392	u669	m42	STRASSER	By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
L118391	u666	m42	RENAULT	What else, my dear Major?
L118390	u669	m42	STRASSER	Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
L118389	u666	m42	RENAULT	You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
L118386	u666	m42	RENAULT	Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
L118385	u669	m42	STRASSER	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
L118384	u666	m42	RENAULT	Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
L119508	u667	m42	RICK	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
L119507	u666	m42	RENAULT	Uh huh.
L119506	u667	m42	RICK	Our expenses?
L119505	u666	m42	RENAULT	And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
L119504	u667	m42	RICK	My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
L119503	u666	m42	RENAULT	It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
L119502	u666	m42	RENAULT	I think perhaps you're right.
L119501	u667	m42	RICK	Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
L119500	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
L119484	u667	m42	RICK	As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
L119483	u666	m42	RENAULT	I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
L119482	u667	m42	RICK	Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
L119481	u666	m42	RENAULT	What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
L119480	u667	m42	RICK	Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
L119479	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
L119445	u667	m42	RICK	And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
L119444	u666	m42	RENAULT	You think of everything, don't you?
L119443	u667	m42	RICK	If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
L119433	u666	m42	RENAULT	That is my least vulnerable spot.
L119432	u667	m42	RICK	Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
L119431	u666	m42	RENAULT	Call off your watch-dogs you said.
L119430	u667	m42	RICK	I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
L119429	u666	m42	RENAULT	I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
L119425	u666	m42	RENAULT	Put that gun down.
L119424	u667	m42	RICK	I have. Sit down over there.
L119423	u666	m42	RENAULT	Have you taken leave of your senses?
L119422	u667	m42	RICK	-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
L119399	u666	m42	RENAULT	Serves me right for not being musical.
L119398	u667	m42	RICK	Sam's piano.
L119397	u666	m42	RENAULT	Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
L119396	u667	m42	RICK	I have the letters right here.
L119395	u666	m42	RENAULT	Is everything ready?
L119394	u667	m42	RICK	Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
L119393	u666	m42	RENAULT	You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
L119392	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, he won't be followed here.
L119391	u667	m42	RICK	I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
L119390	u666	m42	RENAULT	I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
L119389	u667	m42	RICK	You're late.
L119376	u666	m42	RENAULT	Go ahead, Ricky.
L119375	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, thanks.
L119374	u666	m42	RENAULT	Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
L119373	u667	m42	RICK	I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
L119372	u666	m42	RENAULT	I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
L119371	u667	m42	RICK	Well, she isn't just any woman.
L119370	u666	m42	RENAULT	There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
L119369	u667	m42	RICK	I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
L119368	u667	m42	RICK	Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
L119367	u666	m42	RENAULT	It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
L119366	u667	m42	RICK	Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
L119363	u666	m42	RENAULT	You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
L119362	u667	m42	RICK	Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
L119361	u666	m42	RENAULT	What friend?
L119360	u667	m42	RICK	And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
L119359	u666	m42	RENAULT	Huh?
L119358	u667	m42	RICK	You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
L119357	u666	m42	RENAULT	Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
L119356	u667	m42	RICK	Well, they're all excellent reasons.
L119355	u666	m42	RENAULT	Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
L119354	u667	m42	RICK	-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
L119353	u666	m42	RENAULT	Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
L119352	u667	m42	RICK	But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
L119215	u666	m42	RENAULT	I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
L119214	u667	m42	RICK	How can you close me up? On what grounds?
L119183	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
L119182	u667	m42	RICK	Put it down as a gesture to love.
L119181	u666	m42	RENAULT	Why do you interfere with my little romances?
L119180	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah? Why?
L119179	u666	m42	RENAULT	As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
L119062	u666	m42	RENAULT	Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
L119061	u667	m42	RICK	So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
L119060	u666	m42	RENAULT	Huh?
L119059	u667	m42	RICK	Well, it looks like you're a little late.
L119058	u666	m42	RENAULT	Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
L119057	u667	m42	RICK	Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
L119056	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
L119055	u667	m42	RICK	That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
L119054	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
L118793	u666	m42	RENAULT	Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
L118792	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, it's my party.
L118770	u667	m42	RICK	-- Thanks. I will.
L118769	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, no, Rick never --
L118759	u667	m42	RICK	-- Hello, Ilsa.
L118758	u666	m42	RENAULT	Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
L118625	u667	m42	RICK	I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
L118624	u666	m42	RENAULT	That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
L118615	u666	m42	RENAULT	And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
L118614	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, how do you do?
L118579	u666	m42	RENAULT	Excuse me.
L118578	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah, you were saying?
L118575	u667	m42	RICK	Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
L118574	u666	m42	RENAULT	I have my orders.
L118573	u667	m42	RICK	Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
L118572	u666	m42	RENAULT	The winning side would have paid you much better.
L118571	u667	m42	RICK	And got well paid for it on both occasions.
L118570	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
L118569	u666	m42	RENAULT	Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
L118568	u667	m42	RICK	Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
L118567	u666	m42	RENAULT	It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
L118566	u667	m42	RICK	Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
L118565	u666	m42	RENAULT	I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
L118564	u667	m42	RICK	He'll take one.
L118563	u666	m42	RENAULT	He is traveling with a lady.
L118562	u667	m42	RICK	Why two?
L118561	u666	m42	RENAULT	Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
L118560	u667	m42	RICK	Okay.
L118559	u666	m42	RENAULT	Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
L118558	u667	m42	RICK	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
L118557	u666	m42	RENAULT	Is that a serious offer?
L118556	u667	m42	RICK	Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
L118555	u666	m42	RENAULT	This is the end of the chase.
L118554	u667	m42	RICK	-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
L118553	u666	m42	RENAULT	Oh, but I just told you. --
L118552	u667	m42	RICK	His escape.
L118551	u666	m42	RENAULT	Manages what?
L118550	u667	m42	RICK	It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
L118549	u666	m42	RENAULT	It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
L118548	u667	m42	RICK	Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
L118547	u666	m42	RENAULT	Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
L118546	u667	m42	RICK	Victor Laszlo?
L118545	u666	m42	RENAULT	Victor Laszlo.
L118544	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah? What's his name?
L118543	u666	m42	RENAULT	That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
L118542	u667	m42	RICK	I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
L118541	u666	m42	RENAULT	Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
L118540	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah? Have a brandy?
L118539	u666	m42	RENAULT	How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
L118534	u666	m42	RENAULT	Perhaps not.
L118533	u667	m42	RICK	I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
L118531	u667	m42	RICK	Our entertainment is enough.
L118530	u666	m42	RENAULT	You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
L118529	u666	m42	RENAULT	A wise foreign policy.
L118528	u667	m42	RICK	I stick my neck out for nobody.
L118527	u666	m42	RENAULT	If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
L118526	u666	m42	RENAULT	This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
L118525	u667	m42	RICK	What, again?
L118524	u666	m42	RENAULT	Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
L118518	u666	m42	RENAULT	Huh!
L118517	u667	m42	RICK	I was misinformed.
L118516	u666	m42	RENAULT	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
L118515	u667	m42	RICK	My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
L118514	u666	m42	RENAULT	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
L118513	u667	m42	RICK	It was a combination of all three.
L118511	u666	m42	RENAULT	The clipper to America.
L118510	u667	m42	RICK	Why? What's in Lisbon?
L118509	u666	m42	RENAULT	The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
L118507	u667	m42	RICK	When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
L118506	u666	m42	RENAULT	You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
L118505	u666	m42	RENAULT	How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
L118504	u667	m42	RICK	Hello, Louis.
L118495	u672	m42	YVONNE	Take your hands off me!
L118494	u667	m42	RICK	Come on, we're going to get your coat.
L118492	u667	m42	RICK	-- Sacha, call a cab.
L118491	u672	m42	YVONNE	Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
L118489	u672	m42	YVONNE	Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
L118488	u667	m42	RICK	Sacha, she's had enough.
L118487	u672	m42	YVONNE	Give me another.
L118486	u667	m42	RICK	I never make plans that far ahead.
L118485	u672	m42	YVONNE	Will I see you tonight?
L118484	u667	m42	RICK	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
L118483	u672	m42	YVONNE	Where were you last night?
L119495	u667	m42	RICK	Put it down!
L119494	u669	m42	STRASSER	Get me the Radio Tower!
L119493	u667	m42	RICK	Put that phone down!
L119492	u669	m42	STRASSER	Hello?
L119491	u667	m42	RICK	I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
L119490	u669	m42	STRASSER	I would advise you not to interfere.
L118651	u669	m42	STRASSER	Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
L118650	u667	m42	RICK	You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
L118647	u669	m42	STRASSER	Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
L118646	u667	m42	RICK	Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
L118645	u669	m42	STRASSER	In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
L118644	u667	m42	RICK	My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
L118643	u669	m42	STRASSER	You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
L118642	u667	m42	RICK	Are my eyes really brown?
L118636	u667	m42	RICK	I haven't the slightest idea.
L118635	u669	m42	STRASSER	Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
L118634	u667	m42	RICK	Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
L118629	u667	m42	RICK	It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
L118628	u669	m42	STRASSER	Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
L118627	u667	m42	RICK	There seems to be no secret about that.
L118626	u669	m42	STRASSER	I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
L118623	u667	m42	RICK	I'm a drunkard.
L118622	u669	m42	STRASSER	What is your nationality?
L118621	u667	m42	RICK	Make it official, if you like.
L118604	u671	m42	UGARTE	Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
L118603	u667	m42	RICK	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
L118602	u671	m42	UGARTE	Rick! Rick, help me!
L118453	u671	m42	UGARTE	Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
L118452	u667	m42	RICK	I don't want them here overnight.
L118451	u671	m42	UGARTE	Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
L118450	u667	m42	RICK	For how long?
L118449	u671	m42	UGARTE	One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
L118447	u671	m42	UGARTE	Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
L118446	u667	m42	RICK	Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
L118445	u671	m42	UGARTE	Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
L118444	u667	m42	RICK	I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
L118443	u671	m42	UGARTE	But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
L118442	u667	m42	RICK	For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
L118441	u671	m42	UGARTE	But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
L118440	u667	m42	RICK	If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
L118439	u671	m42	UGARTE	I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
L118438	u667	m42	RICK	No.
L118437	u671	m42	UGARTE	Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
L118435	u671	m42	UGARTE	You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
L118434	u667	m42	RICK	They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
L118433	u671	m42	UGARTE	May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
L118431	u667	m42	RICK	-- You thought what?
L118430	u671	m42	UGARTE	Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
L118429	u667	m42	RICK	Well, what makes you think I haven't?
L118428	u671	m42	UGARTE	Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
L118423	u667	m42	RICK	Hello Ugarte.
L118422	u671	m42	UGARTE	Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
L118890	u668	m42	SAM	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
L118889	u667	m42	RICK	Where is she? Have you seen her?
L118873	u668	m42	SAM	The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
L118872	u667	m42	RICK	And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
L118863	u667	m42	RICK	You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
L118862	u668	m42	SAM	This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
L118843	u668	m42	SAM	Yes, boss.
L118842	u667	m42	RICK	If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
L118841	u668	m42	SAM	Well, I don't think I can remember it.
L118840	u667	m42	RICK	You played it for her and you can play it for me.
L118839	u668	m42	SAM	No, I don't.
L118838	u667	m42	RICK	Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
L118837	u668	m42	SAM	Just a little something of my own.
L118836	u667	m42	RICK	What's that you're playing?
L118834	u667	m42	RICK	I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
L118833	u668	m42	SAM	Uh, my watch stopped.
L118832	u667	m42	RICK	Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
L118831	u668	m42	SAM	Yeah, boss?
L118830	u667	m42	RICK	They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
L118829	u668	m42	SAM	No, sir. I'm staying right here.
L118828	u667	m42	RICK	Shut up and go home, will you?
L118827	u668	m42	SAM	We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
L118826	u667	m42	RICK	She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
L118825	u668	m42	SAM	Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
L118824	u667	m42	RICK	No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
L118823	u668	m42	SAM	Boss, let's get out of here.
L118822	u667	m42	RICK	Then don't have a drink.
L118821	u668	m42	SAM	No. Not me, boss.
L118820	u667	m42	RICK	Good. Then have a drink.
L118819	u668	m42	SAM	Well, I ain't sleepy either.
L118818	u667	m42	RICK	No.
L118817	u668	m42	SAM	You ever going to bed?
L118816	u667	m42	RICK	No.
L118815	u668	m42	SAM	Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
L118814	u667	m42	RICK	Not right now.
L118813	u668	m42	SAM	Boss, ain't you going to bed?
L118812	u667	m42	RICK	Yeah?
L118811	u668	m42	SAM	Boss!
L118478	u667	m42	RICK	Sorry.
L118477	u668	m42	SAM	Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
L118476	u667	m42	RICK	He'll double what I pay you.
L118475	u668	m42	SAM	I like it fine here.
L118474	u667	m42	RICK	Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
L285660	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Apparently so.
L285659	u1377	m91	BILL	Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
L285658	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
L285657	u1377	m91	BILL	It's true.
L285652	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
L285651	u1377	m91	BILL	With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
L285650	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Only till they get you into the local school.
L285649	u1377	m91	BILL	I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
L285648	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
L285627	u1377	m91	BILL	Very well, Grandpa.
L285626	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Give him the you-know-what.
L285586	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
L285585	u1377	m91	BILL	But Grandpa, you said...
L285584	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	This is going too far, young man.
L285579	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
L285578	u1377	m91	BILL	Why?
L285577	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
L285576	u1377	m91	BILL	No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
L285575	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
L285574	u1377	m91	BILL	I know.
L285573	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	That was a googly!
L285552	u1377	m91	BILL	I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
L285551	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Never let a rat creep up on you.
L285538	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
L285537	u1377	m91	BILL	Can I try?
L285454	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
L285453	u1377	m91	BILL	Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
L285452	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	What's that?
L285299	u1386	m91	ROGER	They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
L285298	u1377	m91	BILL	Won't they have maps?
L285297	u1386	m91	ROGER	They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
L285294	u1386	m91	ROGER	OK. You're in.
L285293	u1377	m91	BILL	Bugger off, you bloody sod.
L285292	u1386	m91	ROGER	Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
L285291	u1377	m91	BILL	Bloody.
L285290	u1386	m91	ROGER	Bloody.
L285289	u1377	m91	BILL	Sod.
L285288	u1386	m91	ROGER	Sod.
L285287	u1377	m91	BILL	Bugger off.
L285286	u1386	m91	ROGER	That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
L285283	u1377	m91	BILL	I only know one.
L285282	u1386	m91	ROGER	Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
L285281	u1386	m91	ROGER	Say them.
L285280	u1377	m91	BILL	Yes.
L285279	u1386	m91	ROGER	Do you know any swear words?
L285278	u1377	m91	BILL	I don't mind.
L285277	u1386	m91	ROGER	You want to join our gang?
L285274	u1386	m91	ROGER	They're not.
L285273	u1377	m91	BILL	"My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. ""Boys are going missing all the time."""
L285272	u1386	m91	ROGER	Who told you that?
L285271	u1377	m91	BILL	The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
L285270	u1386	m91	ROGER	What's that?
L285269	u1377	m91	BILL	I know a secret.
L285268	u1386	m91	ROGER	Yes, you was. Make him talk.
L285267	u1377	m91	BILL	I never was.
L285262	u1377	m91	BILL	Looking for shrapnel.
L285261	u1386	m91	ROGER	What are you doing here? This is our territory
L285226	u1386	m91	ROGER	Yes, she did, didn't she?
L285225	u1377	m91	BILL	No, she didn't.
L285224	u1386	m91	ROGER	Pauline's mum got killed.
L285430	u1387	m91	SUE	Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
L285429	u1377	m91	BILL	Pauline.
L285428	u1387	m91	SUE	Who with?
L285427	u1377	m91	BILL	It's easy. I've done it.
L285426	u1387	m91	SUE	I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
L285377	u1387	m91	SUE	We thought it was poison.
L285376	u1377	m91	BILL	Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
L285260	u1377	m91	BILL	Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
L285259	u1387	m91	SUE	Tell them about Pauline's mum.
L285234	u1377	m91	BILL	You do it. You're a girl.
L285233	u1387	m91	SUE	Ask her yourself.
L285232	u1377	m91	BILL	Go and ask her if she wants to play.
L285093	u1377	m91	BILL	Could.
L285092	u1387	m91	SUE	You couldn't.
L285091	u1377	m91	BILL	Would.
L285090	u1387	m91	SUE	You wouldn't.
L285089	u1377	m91	BILL	It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
L285088	u1387	m91	SUE	He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
L285647	u1380	m91	DAWN	Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
L285646	u1377	m91	BILL	Well, for the baby, really.
L285645	u1380	m91	DAWN	You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
L285361	u1380	m91	DAWN	That's not the point.
L285360	u1377	m91	BILL	You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
L285359	u1380	m91	DAWN	Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
L285214	u1377	m91	BILL	It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
L285213	u1380	m91	DAWN	I'm starting my own collection.
L285212	u1377	m91	BILL	Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
L285198	u1377	m91	BILL	It's not the same.
L285197	u1380	m91	DAWN	They've got the real thing outside.
L285196	u1377	m91	BILL	Can't we just see the end?
L285161	u1377	m91	BILL	...and six...
L285160	u1380	m91	DAWN	Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
L285159	u1377	m91	BILL	...and four and five...
L285158	u1380	m91	DAWN	The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
L285027	u1377	m91	BILL	It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
L285026	u1380	m91	DAWN	You're the biggest fibber.
L284999	u1380	m91	DAWN	He's the worst liar.
L284998	u1377	m91	BILL	I did see them. I did.
L285441	u1379	m91	CLIVE	The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
L285440	u1377	m91	BILL	You said that last year, Dad.
L285113	u1379	m91	CLIVE	That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
L285112	u1377	m91	BILL	It's like telling fibs.
L285111	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
L285068	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
L285067	u1377	m91	BILL	But Dad, It's the News.
L285012	u1379	m91	CLIVE	The sodding water table.
L285011	u1377	m91	BILL	Crocodiles! Aah!
L285484	u1384	m91	MAC	We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
L285483	u1377	m91	BILL	Who pays for them?
L285482	u1384	m91	MAC	They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
L285481	u1377	m91	BILL	Wow!
L285480	u1384	m91	MAC	Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
L285479	u1377	m91	BILL	What's that?
L285464	u1378	m91	BRUCE	Please yourself.
L285463	u1380	m91	DAWN	You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
L285462	u1378	m91	BRUCE	I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
L285461	u1380	m91	DAWN	You do, you do. You're just not saying.
L285460	u1378	m91	BRUCE	I don't know?
L285459	u1380	m91	DAWN	Where?
L285458	u1378	m91	BRUCE	We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
L285457	u1380	m91	DAWN	What is it?
L285433	u1378	m91	BRUCE	Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
L285432	u1380	m91	DAWN	Air-raid?
L285431	u1378	m91	BRUCE	Boy, that was some air-raid.
L285332	u1380	m91	DAWN	Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
L285331	u1378	m91	BRUCE	Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
L285210	u1378	m91	BRUCE	I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
L285209	u1380	m91	DAWN	They might be.
L285208	u1378	m91	BRUCE	Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
L285207	u1380	m91	DAWN	A bit too quick.
L285206	u1378	m91	BRUCE	It was great for me, how was it for you.
L285611	u1379	m91	CLIVE	And the bride.
L285610	u1384	m91	MAC	And absent bridegrooms!
L285609	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Here's to music. And absent friends.
L285606	u1384	m91	MAC	Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
L285605	u1379	m91	CLIVE	And I'm still just a lad myself.
L285604	u1384	m91	MAC	So you're going to be a grandfather.
L285410	u1384	m91	MAC	I will if you will!
L285409	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Don't panic!  Keep your head!
L285405	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Bugger the Buffs.
L285404	u1384	m91	MAC	You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
L285402	u1384	m91	MAC	There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
L285401	u1379	m91	CLIVE	I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
L285400	u1384	m91	MAC	Naturally.
L285399	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Except the servicemen.
L285398	u1384	m91	MAC	Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
L285397	u1379	m91	CLIVE	How's your war, Mac?
L285396	u1384	m91	MAC	Propaganda. We've been had.
L285395	u1379	m91	CLIVE	There was talk of planting some when we first came.
L285394	u1384	m91	MAC	You need trees for an avenue.
L285393	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Why not?
L285392	u1384	m91	MAC	Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
L285391	u1379	m91	CLIVE	What about it?
L285390	u1384	m91	MAC	Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
L285389	u1379	m91	CLIVE	What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
L285084	u1379	m91	CLIVE	I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
L285083	u1384	m91	MAC	What did we know? We were seventeen.
L285082	u1379	m91	CLIVE	If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
L285081	u1384	m91	MAC	You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
L285078	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Kiss me Hardy.
L285077	u1384	m91	MAC	Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
L285076	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Weeds will grow, Mac.
L285075	u1384	m91	MAC	Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
L285044	u1384	m91	MAC	What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
L285043	u1379	m91	CLIVE	And Jim.
L285040	u1384	m91	MAC	....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
L285039	u1379	m91	CLIVE	...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
L285038	u1384	m91	MAC	...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
L285014	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
L285013	u1384	m91	MAC	Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
L285615	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Fair enough.  The river.
L285614	u1381	m91	GRACE	I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
L285383	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Where to?
L285382	u1381	m91	GRACE	I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
L285381	u1379	m91	CLIVE	I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
L285380	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
L285379	u1381	m91	GRACE	When do you think you'll get leave again?
L285370	u1379	m91	CLIVE	A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
L285369	u1381	m91	GRACE	What are you going to be then?
L285368	u1379	m91	CLIVE	I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
L285367	u1381	m91	GRACE	Why didn't they say that before you started?
L285366	u1379	m91	CLIVE	That's it.
L285365	u1381	m91	GRACE	You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
L285363	u1381	m91	GRACE	You taste it.
L285362	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
L285358	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Jam is jam! It's just jam!
L285357	u1381	m91	GRACE	It looks....foreign.
L285356	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Well?
L285354	u1381	m91	GRACE	How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
L285353	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Well, it's off ration. We know that.
L285352	u1381	m91	GRACE	We don't know anything about it
L285347	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Jam.
L285346	u1381	m91	GRACE	And what's that?
L285107	u1381	m91	GRACE	I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
L285106	u1379	m91	CLIVE	Oh, that.
L285105	u1381	m91	GRACE	You joined up.
L285104	u1379	m91	CLIVE	What's that?
L285103	u1381	m91	GRACE	Has Sue got it right?
L285054	u1381	m91	GRACE	And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
L285053	u1379	m91	CLIVE	We all had to write a last letter home.
L285051	u1381	m91	GRACE	They'd gone.
L285050	u1379	m91	CLIVE	We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
L285049	u1381	m91	GRACE	No Turks.
L285641	u1380	m91	DAWN	Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
L285640	u1381	m91	GRACE	Now take deep breaths, and push.
L285588	u1381	m91	GRACE	Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
L285587	u1380	m91	DAWN	It looks a bit fishy to me.
L285525	u1380	m91	DAWN	It's not. It's happening to me.
L285524	u1381	m91	GRACE	I don't believe this is happening to me.
L285478	u1380	m91	DAWN	Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
L285477	u1381	m91	GRACE	I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
L285476	u1380	m91	DAWN	He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
L285475	u1381	m91	GRACE	What did he say?
L285467	u1381	m91	GRACE	Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
L285466	u1380	m91	DAWN	He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
L285465	u1381	m91	GRACE	What is it, pet?
L285312	u1380	m91	DAWN	Who said anything about love?
L285311	u1381	m91	GRACE	You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
L285308	u1381	m91	GRACE	There, there, my baby.
L285307	u1380	m91	DAWN	I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
L285304	u1380	m91	DAWN	No, I won't.
L285303	u1381	m91	GRACE	You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
L285302	u1380	m91	DAWN	Out.
L285301	u1381	m91	GRACE	And where do you think you're going?
L285257	u1380	m91	DAWN	It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
L285256	u1381	m91	GRACE	I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
L285223	u1380	m91	DAWN	That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
L285222	u1381	m91	GRACE	The ideas you get in your head.
L285221	u1380	m91	DAWN	Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
L285151	u1380	m91	DAWN	Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
L285150	u1381	m91	GRACE	Don't be silly, Dawn.
L285149	u1380	m91	DAWN	What would we do if a German came into the house?
L285145	u1381	m91	GRACE	Half the time he's bluffing.
L285144	u1380	m91	DAWN	He always knows.
L285137	u1380	m91	DAWN	After this dance.
L285136	u1381	m91	GRACE	Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
L285135	u1380	m91	DAWN	You know it? It must be an old one.
L285033	u1381	m91	GRACE	Just ignore her, Mac.
L285032	u1380	m91	DAWN	This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
L285031	u1381	m91	GRACE	I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
L285558	u1381	m91	GRACE	Wasn't it lovely?
L285557	u1383	m91	GRANDMA	...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
L285545	u1383	m91	GRANDMA	How are we going to cope?
L285544	u1381	m91	GRACE	Up to six weeks, I think.
L285543	u1383	m91	GRANDMA	Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
L285003	u1383	m91	GRANDMA	Or what?
L285002	u1381	m91	GRACE	No, Mother! It's War! War!
L285001	u1383	m91	GRANDMA	Is it peace in out time?
L285535	u1384	m91	MAC	Look after yourself, Grace.
L285534	u1381	m91	GRACE	I wish it could all have been different.
L285533	u1384	m91	MAC	You might still have a house.
L285532	u1381	m91	GRACE	Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
L285503	u1381	m91	GRACE	We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
L285502	u1384	m91	MAC	We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
L285501	u1381	m91	GRACE	This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
L285500	u1384	m91	MAC	We did the decent thing.
L285499	u1381	m91	GRACE	He could always make me laugh.
L285498	u1384	m91	MAC	Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
L285497	u1381	m91	GRACE	You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
L285496	u1384	m91	MAC	It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
L285495	u1381	m91	GRACE	Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
L285494	u1384	m91	MAC	She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
L285492	u1384	m91	MAC	A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
L285491	u1381	m91	GRACE	Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
L285486	u1384	m91	MAC	Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
L285485	u1381	m91	GRACE	Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
L285438	u1381	m91	GRACE	That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
L285437	u1384	m91	MAC	...since I used to take you to the Proms?
L285436	u1381	m91	GRACE	Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
L285250	u1384	m91	MAC	Play something, Grace.
L285249	u1381	m91	GRACE	It seems to have survived.
L285130	u1384	m91	MAC	Grace!
L285129	u1381	m91	GRACE	Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
L285122	u1384	m91	MAC	It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
L285121	u1381	m91	GRACE	I can't do it. What's the point?
L285042	u1384	m91	MAC	How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
L285041	u1381	m91	GRACE	It was the best time of his life.
L285608	u1381	m91	GRACE	And now we're glad you did.
L285607	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
L285529	u1381	m91	GRACE	How long?
L285528	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
L285527	u1381	m91	GRACE	What did I do to deserve this?
L285448	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
L285447	u1381	m91	GRACE	Father, that's enough now
L285446	u1382	m91	GRANDFATHER GEORGE	To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
L285603	u1385	m91	MOLLY	Happy as can be. In the old groove.
L285602	u1381	m91	GRACE	I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
L285425	u1385	m91	MOLLY	Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
L285424	u1381	m91	GRACE	You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
L285423	u1385	m91	MOLLY	Am I? Maybe I am.
L285422	u1381	m91	GRACE	You're having me on, Molly.
L285421	u1385	m91	MOLLY	Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
L285420	u1381	m91	GRACE	Molly!
L285418	u1381	m91	GRACE	You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
L285417	u1385	m91	MOLLY	I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
L285416	u1381	m91	GRACE	I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
L285415	u1385	m91	MOLLY	God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
L285021	u1381	m91	GRACE	I know you mean well.
L285020	u1385	m91	MOLLY	I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
L285019	u1385	m91	MOLLY	Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
L285018	u1381	m91	GRACE	It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
L285016	u1381	m91	GRACE	My aunt in Australia has offered..
L285015	u1385	m91	MOLLY	It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
L371642	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
L371641	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
L371619	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
L371618	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
L371279	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
L371278	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
L371277	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What is, Red, the intention or the act?
L371276	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
L371275	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
L371274	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	What do you want me to do?
L371271	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He's parted his moorings.
L371270	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	You talked to Walt?
L371269	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
L371222	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski ? Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
L371221	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
L371212	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
L371211	u2017	m131	DAGO RED	There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
L371810	u2018	m131	DUKE	Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
L371809	u2022	m131	HENRY	Stop him! Stop that man!
L371369	u2018	m131	DUKE	Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
L371368	u2022	m131	HENRY	Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
L371367	u2018	m131	DUKE	What are you going to do with him?
L371157	u2018	m131	DUKE	You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
L371156	u2022	m131	HENRY	You boys'll have to go to work early.
L371154	u2018	m131	DUKE	How you, Radar?
L371153	u2022	m131	HENRY	Yes, O'Reilly?
L371142	u2022	m131	HENRY	I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
L371141	u2018	m131	DUKE	Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
L371021	u2018	m131	DUKE	Just one for a start.
L371020	u2022	m131	HENRY	I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
L371017	u2022	m131	HENRY	They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
L371016	u2018	m131	DUKE	Never this close.
L371015	u2022	m131	HENRY	Good. You've both been working close to the front.
L371014	u2018	m131	DUKE	They give you copies to burn.
L371013	u2022	m131	HENRY	You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
L371012	u2018	m131	DUKE	Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
L371011	u2022	m131	HENRY	Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
L371010	u2018	m131	DUKE	Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
L371881	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
L371880	u2018	m131	DUKE	Y'all mind the store.
L371823	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
L371822	u2018	m131	DUKE	You really think we hurt him that bad?
L371821	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
L371748	u2018	m131	DUKE	Or her figger.
L371747	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
L371707	u2018	m131	DUKE	There's only one way.
L371706	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
L371700	u2018	m131	DUKE	I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
L371699	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
L371624	u2018	m131	DUKE	Not enough to be a pro.
L371623	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
L371622	u2018	m131	DUKE	Epidural hematoma?
L371621	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Look at that right eye.
L371620	u2018	m131	DUKE	Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
L371255	u2018	m131	DUKE	He said it for us all, Walt.
L371254	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Miss you, Walt.
L371252	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Pour one for Painless.
L371251	u2018	m131	DUKE	How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
L371186	u2018	m131	DUKE	Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
L371185	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Don't you use olives?
L371181	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	No.  Or why you should.
L371180	u2018	m131	DUKE	Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
L371179	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Back home.
L371178	u2018	m131	DUKE	Which hospital?
L371177	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Hospital.
L371176	u2018	m131	DUKE	Where?
L371175	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	That's right.
L371174	u2018	m131	DUKE	I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
L371173	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Home.
L371172	u2018	m131	DUKE	Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
L371864	u2018	m131	DUKE	No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
L371863	u2023	m131	HO-JON	You ? must ? open ? me ? up ? again?
L371412	u2023	m131	HO-JON	That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
L371411	u2018	m131	DUKE	I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
L371103	u2018	m131	DUKE	Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
L371102	u2023	m131	HO-JON	I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
L371101	u2018	m131	DUKE	Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
L371100	u2023	m131	HO-JON	Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
L371124	u2019	m131	FRANK	...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
L371123	u2018	m131	DUKE	Us. Lead us not into...
L371118	u2018	m131	DUKE	You make a mean martini, kid.
L371117	u2019	m131	FRANK	So long, Ho-Jon.
L371114	u2018	m131	DUKE	Same general idea.
L371113	u2019	m131	FRANK	Wisconsin.
L371112	u2018	m131	DUKE	The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
L371111	u2019	m131	FRANK	I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
L371108	u2019	m131	FRANK	I don't drink intoxicants.
L371107	u2018	m131	DUKE	But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
L371052	u2018	m131	DUKE	Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
L371051	u2019	m131	FRANK	This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
L371050	u2018	m131	DUKE	What the hell's going on here?
L371049	u2019	m131	FRANK	Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
L371876	u2018	m131	DUKE	Perfectionist.
L371875	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
L371874	u2018	m131	DUKE	What's there to do? You found the sliver.
L371873	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
L371835	u2018	m131	DUKE	And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
L371834	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	We got to stop them right here.
L371800	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
L371799	u2018	m131	DUKE	What?
L371928	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
L371927	u2018	m131	DUKE	Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
L371918	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
L371917	u2018	m131	DUKE	Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
L371899	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
L371898	u2018	m131	DUKE	But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
L371897	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
L371896	u2018	m131	DUKE	I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
L371879	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
L371878	u2018	m131	DUKE	We could steal one of the choppers.
L371877	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
L371872	u2018	m131	DUKE	Be right with you.
L371871	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Any time. Whenever we want.
L371870	u2018	m131	DUKE	When?
L371869	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
L371853	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Same here. You can retire my number.
L371852	u2018	m131	DUKE	Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
L371817	u2018	m131	DUKE	Yeah, if I can.
L371816	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
L371806	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
L371805	u2018	m131	DUKE	Look at the size of those two beasts.
L371776	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
L371775	u2018	m131	DUKE	Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
L371770	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
L371769	u2018	m131	DUKE	How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
L371766	u2018	m131	DUKE	The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
L371765	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
L371764	u2018	m131	DUKE	Never heard of him.
L371761	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
L371760	u2018	m131	DUKE	Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
L371705	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
L371704	u2018	m131	DUKE	I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
L371703	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
L371702	u2018	m131	DUKE	You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
L371701	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
L371694	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	An application to Androscoggin College.
L371693	u2018	m131	DUKE	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
L371692	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	When will he be able to write?
L371408	u2018	m131	DUKE	A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
L371407	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Never mind. Forget it.
L371403	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
L371402	u2018	m131	DUKE	Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
L371364	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
L371363	u2018	m131	DUKE	That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
L371250	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
L371249	u2018	m131	DUKE	Y'all just act natural.
L371215	u2018	m131	DUKE	What do you think, Trapper?
L371214	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
L371213	u2018	m131	DUKE	And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
L371206	u2018	m131	DUKE	Call Dago Red.
L371205	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
L371203	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
L371202	u2018	m131	DUKE	Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
L371199	u2018	m131	DUKE	Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
L371198	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
L371197	u2018	m131	DUKE	Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
L371191	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
L371190	u2018	m131	DUKE	Sixteen times.
L371189	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
L371151	u2018	m131	DUKE	And it's the ninth inning.
L371150	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
L371149	u2018	m131	DUKE	Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
L371148	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The chest-cutter.
L371147	u2018	m131	DUKE	What's that?
L371146	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Except we forgot one other small thing.
L371145	u2018	m131	DUKE	No, Hawkeye just said it all.
L371137	u2018	m131	DUKE	We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
L371136	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
L371110	u2018	m131	DUKE	We been had.
L371109	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
L371094	u2018	m131	DUKE	So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
L371093	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He can't take much more time on the table.
L371092	u2018	m131	DUKE	Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
L371062	u2018	m131	DUKE	Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
L371061	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
L371055	u2018	m131	DUKE	And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
L371054	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
L371053	u2018	m131	DUKE	Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
L371019	u2018	m131	DUKE	That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
L371018	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
L371007	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
L371006	u2018	m131	DUKE	What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
L371005	u2018	m131	DUKE	The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
L371004	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, there it is. Jesus!
L371002	u2018	m131	DUKE	I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
L371001	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore ?  House. You in the market Duke?
L371000	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
L370999	u2018	m131	DUKE	What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
L370997	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
L370996	u2018	m131	DUKE	C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
L370995	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
L370994	u2018	m131	DUKE	Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
L370993	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Crabapple Cove. Maine.
L370992	u2018	m131	DUKE	Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
L370991	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
L370990	u2018	m131	DUKE	Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
L370989	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Make it yourself, or is it real?
L370988	u2018	m131	DUKE	I got some.
L370987	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
L370986	u2018	m131	DUKE	You got directions?
L370985	u2018	m131	DUKE	Duke Forrest.
L370984	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
L371435	u2019	m131	FRANK	I can't... couldn't.
L371434	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Wait a second...
L371433	u2019	m131	FRANK	Don't stop now! Please...
L371432	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Frank...
L371421	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
L371420	u2019	m131	FRANK	Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
L371419	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
L371418	u2019	m131	FRANK	Godless buffoons, all of them.
L371400	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
L371399	u2019	m131	FRANK	Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
L371398	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Ravenous. What about you?
L371397	u2019	m131	FRANK	It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
L371396	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	We think the same way.
L371395	u2019	m131	FRANK	We're a good team.
L371394	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	I think it's a marvelous letter.
L371393	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
L371392	u2019	m131	FRANK	People will talk.
L371391	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	I have a tent to myself.
L371390	u2019	m131	FRANK	No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
L371389	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
L371448	u2019	m131	FRANK	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
L371447	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I was just asking...
L371131	u2019	m131	FRANK	...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
L371130	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
L371129	u2019	m131	FRANK	...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
L371122	u2019	m131	FRANK	...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
L371121	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
L371120	u2019	m131	FRANK	Give us this day our daily...
L371106	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
L371105	u2019	m131	FRANK	Is that liquor?
L371828	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
L371827	u2022	m131	HENRY	You willing to b-back that up with odds?
L371826	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
L371782	u2022	m131	HENRY	N-n-no thanks, G-General.
L371781	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
L371780	u2022	m131	HENRY	But what about Major Houlihan?
L371779	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
L371778	u2022	m131	HENRY	A football game?
L371777	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
L371759	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
L371758	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
L371757	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
L371756	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I think I heard about that.
L371755	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
L371754	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
L371746	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
L371745	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
L371744	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	And there it is.
L371743	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
L371742	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Right.
L371741	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
L371740	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
L371739	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
L371735	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
L371734	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	I want to talk to you, Pierce.
L371733	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
L371726	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You betcher ass, General.
L371725	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
L371722	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	What?
L371721	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You betcher ass, Dad.
L371720	u2020	m131	GENERAL HAMMOND	At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
L371719	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Gimme three.
L371837	u2031	m131	RADAR	All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
L371836	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Radar!
L371685	u2031	m131	RADAR	I found a doner.
L371684	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I though you said we didn't have a drop.
L371683	u2031	m131	RADAR	A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
L371453	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
L371452	u2031	m131	RADAR	Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
L371451	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
L371895	u2029	m131	MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
L371894	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
L371893	u2029	m131	MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	C-A-M-E-M...?
L371892	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
L371891	u2029	m131	MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
L371890	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What for?
L371802	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Not necessarily.
L371801	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
L371774	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He can move in here with us.
L371773	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
L371772	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
L371771	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	So what makes you think he'll play for us?
L371768	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
L371767	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	He only lasted one season.
L371763	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
L371762	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
L371709	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	They're coming.
L371708	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
L371682	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
L371681	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
L371680	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
L371679	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What do we do?
L371678	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
L371677	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I don't get it.
L371676	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
L371675	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Oh, Jesus.
L371674	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I don't feel anything.
L371671	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
L371670	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
L371669	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
L371668	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
L371667	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
L371666	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
L371665	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
L371661	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
L371660	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
L371657	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
L371656	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It's in pretty deep.
L371655	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
L371654	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	For you, Trapper.
L371648	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Radar!
L371647	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
L371592	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
L371591	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Is he out?
L371566	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What's the age of consent in this country?
L371565	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
L371564	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
L371557	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
L371556	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
L371555	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
L371529	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
L371528	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
L371527	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
L371512	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
L371511	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
L371498	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
L371497	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Look.
L371495	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
L371494	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
L371490	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
L371489	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
L371486	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
L371485	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
L371474	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
L371473	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
L371417	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
L371416	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	No, no, that one.
L371415	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
L371304	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
L371303	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
L371298	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
L371297	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	We stand behind all our work.
L371281	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	An eternal damnation.
L371280	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
L371273	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
L371272	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
L371263	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
L371262	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Black capsule.
L371218	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
L371217	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	...But I turned in my knee pads.
L371201	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
L371200	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
L371193	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
L371192	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
L371188	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I like an olive.
L371187	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
L371183	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
L371182	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
L371711	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
L371710	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
L371387	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
L371386	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
L371385	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
L371384	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
L371383	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
L371382	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
L371381	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
L371380	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
L371379	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
L371378	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Major Burns is far from satisfied.
L371377	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That's right. We work well together.
L371376	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	All of them?
L371375	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
L371374	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
L371373	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
L371372	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
L371884	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Hang in there.
L371883	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	It's possible
L371882	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	See you.
L371831	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
L371830	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What's the matter?
L371798	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
L371797	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
L371796	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	I think we could still have a chance.
L371795	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The bastards outconned us.
L371790	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
L371789	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
L371788	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
L371330	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
L371329	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
L371328	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
L371327	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
L371326	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
L371325	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You think he won't.
L371324	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
L371323	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
L371322	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
L371321	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
L371320	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You're asking for somebody else?
L371319	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I didn't mean with me.
L371318	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
L371317	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
L371316	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
L371315	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
L371314	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
L371313	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You're on his side all of the sudden?
L371312	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
L371311	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
L371310	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
L371309	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
L371308	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You're leaving tomorrow?
L371307	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
L371165	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Maria...
L371164	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Even if I weren't.
L371091	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
L371090	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
L371089	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
L371088	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Of course not.
L371087	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
L371086	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Ayuh.
L371085	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
L371084	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
L371083	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
L371082	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Same here.
L371081	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Very happily married.
L371080	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Something else we have in common.
L371079	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	But I'm married.
L371078	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You have a certain modest charm yourself.
L371077	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You're an attractive man.
L371076	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
L371075	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Our minds?
L371074	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
L371073	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
L371072	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It isn't always this rough?
L371071	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
L371070	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
L371069	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	How did you get called that?
L371068	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
L371067	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
L371066	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
L371065	u2026	m131	LIEUTENANT DISH	Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
L371471	u2025	m131	KOREAN DOCTOR	Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
L371470	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Why would he do that?
L371469	u2025	m131	KOREAN DOCTOR	At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
L371468	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
L371467	u2025	m131	KOREAN DOCTOR	I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
L371466	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
L371465	u2025	m131	KOREAN DOCTOR	You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
L371463	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Yeah!
L371462	u2027	m131	LIEUTENANT SCORCH	You really say the cutest things.
L371461	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I didn't have much choice.
L371460	u2027	m131	LIEUTENANT SCORCH	It was really nice of you to take me along.
L371060	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Duke...
L371059	u2027	m131	LIEUTENANT SCORCH	Second pint.
L371058	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
L371913	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Glad to help.
L371912	u2032	m131	SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Thanks.
L371911	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	They missed the boat.
L371910	u2032	m131	SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
L371909	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
L371905	u2032	m131	SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
L371904	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What do you want with those two medical officers?
L371903	u2032	m131	SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Yes, Reverend?
L371902	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Excuse me, Sergeant.
L371901	u2032	m131	SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
L371594	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Let's get his clothes off quick.
L371593	u2028	m131	ME LAY	He's coming to.
L371581	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
L371580	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What's wrong with him?
L371579	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
L371578	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What's the story?
L371577	u2028	m131	ME LAY	I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
L371576	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Why can't you look at him?
L371538	u2028	m131	ME LAY	That's about the only thing I don't do ? that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
L371537	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
L371536	u2028	m131	ME LAY	I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
L371535	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You don't go after the local scrunch?
L371532	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
L371531	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The one and only.
L371530	u2028	m131	ME LAY	The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
L371526	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
L371525	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
L371334	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
L371333	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Morning Painless. How they goin'?
L371302	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
L371301	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
L371300	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	How much time do I have?
L371267	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	You guys got any black capsules?
L371266	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	In the direction you want to go.
L371261	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
L371260	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
L371246	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
L371245	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
L371244	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
L371243	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
L371242	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
L371241	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Just in dreams?
L371240	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	No, never in the slightest.
L371239	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
L371238	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
L371237	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Homosexuality.
L371236	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
L371235	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
L371234	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
L371233	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
L371232	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
L371231	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	There's only one worth noticing.
L371230	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
L371229	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Tell me the whole story, Walt.
L371228	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
L371033	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Poker sounds great. When do you play?
L371032	u2030	m131	PAINLESS	Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
L371861	u2023	m131	HO-JON	I ? wouldn't ? wish ? it ? on ? a ? maneating ? shark.
L371860	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
L371410	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	I don't think so either.
L371409	u2023	m131	HO-JON	And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
L371248	u2023	m131	HO-JON	He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
L371247	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
L371171	u2023	m131	HO-JON	Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
L371170	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
L371116	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
L371115	u2023	m131	HO-JON	Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
L371099	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	That. It's out of the act.
L371098	u2023	m131	HO-JON	I have not understood what you means.
L371097	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You can cut the bow.
L371096	u2023	m131	HO-JON	Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
L371792	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
L371791	u2022	m131	HENRY	It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
L371646	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
L371645	u2022	m131	HENRY	Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
L371371	u2022	m131	HENRY	Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
L371370	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	First decent idea you've had in a month.
L371366	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
L371365	u2022	m131	HENRY	I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
L371362	u2022	m131	HENRY	There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
L371361	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
L371162	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
L371161	u2022	m131	HENRY	I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
L371160	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	About that chest-cutter...
L371159	u2022	m131	HENRY	Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
L371158	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
L371144	u2022	m131	HENRY	That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
L371143	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
L371140	u2022	m131	HENRY	Your tent?
L371139	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
L371138	u2022	m131	HENRY	You don't aim to cause any trouble ? But?
L371025	u2022	m131	HENRY	They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
L371024	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
L371023	u2022	m131	HENRY	If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
L371022	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	The blonde dish.
L371009	u2021	m131	HAWKEYE	Nope, we're assigned heah.
L371008	u2022	m131	HENRY	I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
L371851	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
L371850	u2022	m131	HENRY	We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
L371360	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
L371359	u2022	m131	HENRY	What's wrong with you?
L371357	u2022	m131	HENRY	I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
L371356	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
L371353	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	I did. First and only blow. So far.
L371352	u2022	m131	HENRY	Yes, that's what I mean.
L371351	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	You mean who hit who?
L371350	u2022	m131	HENRY	What's going on? Who started this?
L371611	u2031	m131	RADAR	And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
L371610	u2022	m131	HENRY	Damn.
L371609	u2031	m131	RADAR	Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
L371450	u2031	m131	RADAR	I can try, sir.
L371449	u2022	m131	HENRY	Can you make out what they're talking about?
L371439	u2022	m131	HENRY	Morning, Captain.
L371438	u2031	m131	RADAR	Splendid, sir. No problems.
L371437	u2022	m131	HENRY	Morning, Radar. How were things?
L371436	u2031	m131	RADAR	Good morning, Colonel.
L371044	u2031	m131	RADAR	Yes, Colonel.
L371043	u2022	m131	HENRY	Oh, get out of here!
L371042	u2031	m131	RADAR	Sir?
L371041	u2022	m131	HENRY	Stop that, O'Rielly!
L371040	u2031	m131	RADAR	To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
L371039	u2022	m131	HENRY	Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
L371038	u2031	m131	RADAR	Sir?
L371037	u2022	m131	HENRY	Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
L371036	u2031	m131	RADAR	Sir?
L370978	u2031	m131	RADAR	Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
L370977	u2022	m131	HENRY	We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
L370976	u2031	m131	RADAR	I'm afraid so, Colonel.
L370975	u2022	m131	HENRY	O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
L370974	u2022	m131	HENRY	Yes, dammit, and...
L370973	u2031	m131	RADAR	One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
L370972	u2022	m131	HENRY	Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
L370971	u2031	m131	RADAR	Yes, sir?
L370970	u2022	m131	HENRY	O'Reilly!
L371856	u2022	m131	HENRY	I out-coached that General Hammond.
L371855	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	What's that, Henry?
L371854	u2022	m131	HENRY	Well, there's one big satisfaction.
L371794	u2022	m131	HENRY	They can't do that to me!
L371793	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
L371787	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	I used to throw the javelin.
L371786	u2022	m131	HENRY	Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
L371785	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
L371784	u2022	m131	HENRY	The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
L371783	u2033	m131	SPEARCHUCKER	If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
L371616	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
L371615	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
L371614	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Yeah?
L371613	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
L371612	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
L371442	u2024	m131	HOT LIPS	Good morning.
L371441	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
L371583	u2028	m131	ME LAY	But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
L371582	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
L371575	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Now?
L371574	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
L371571	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
L371570	u2028	m131	ME LAY	No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
L371569	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
L371547	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
L371546	u2028	m131	ME LAY	The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
L371545	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Never mind.
L371543	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
L371542	u2028	m131	ME LAY	Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
L371541	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	What's the bastard really like?
L371534	u2028	m131	ME LAY	I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
L371533	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
L371524	u2028	m131	ME LAY	May I have the surgeon's name, please?
L371523	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
L371804	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
L371803	u2035	m131	UGLY JOHN	As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
L371691	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Boys, we're home free.
L371690	u2035	m131	UGLY JOHN	Nice.
L371689	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
L371688	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	Arterial silk.
L371687	u2035	m131	UGLY JOHN	Nice.
L371686	u2034	m131	TRAPPER	How is he?
L436631	u2443	m157	ANNE	Thank you.
L436630	u2452	m157	MARION	Congratulations.
L436629	u2443	m157	ANNE	Late summer.
L436628	u2452	m157	MARION	When?
L436627	u2443	m157	ANNE	Good.
L436626	u2452	m157	MARION	No.
L436625	u2443	m157	ANNE	"Do you think Francis with an ""i"" is too womanly a name for a boy?"
L436624	u2452	m157	MARION	No.
L436623	u2443	m157	ANNE	"Do you think Frances with an ""e"" is too manly a name for a girl?"
L436587	u2452	m157	MARION	It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
L436586	u2443	m157	ANNE	I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
L436468	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	That would be nice, too.
L436467	u2443	m157	ANNE	Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
L436466	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	That would be nice.
L436465	u2443	m157	ANNE	Next time we'll bring more blankets.
L436424	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	It's a start.
L436423	u2443	m157	ANNE	You call that a compliment?
L436422	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
L436416	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Uh... uh... I...
L436415	u2443	m157	ANNE	It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
L436414	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
L436413	u2443	m157	ANNE	I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
L436432	u2452	m157	MARION	The hell I do.
L436431	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	You got me beat on both accounts.
L436430	u2452	m157	MARION	What do you mean, old and ugly?
L436427	u2452	m157	MARION	No, he takes after his mother...
L436426	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
L436378	u2452	m157	MARION	Pride will do.
L436377	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
L436373	u2452	m157	MARION	His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
L436372	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Cheerful news to greet the morn.
L436371	u2452	m157	MARION	I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
L436370	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Well?
L436362	u2452	m157	MARION	You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
L436361	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Am I one of that sort?
L436349	u2452	m157	MARION	His journals, letters, maps, books...
L436348	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
L436285	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
L436284	u2452	m157	MARION	It worked.  How many men can you raise?
L436283	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
L436282	u2452	m157	MARION	I expect to try.
L436281	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
L436437	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
L436436	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
L436435	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	You got salt last week.
L436369	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
L436368	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I know him well enough?
L436367	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	He's my father.
L436366	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	You don't know him very well, do you?
L436365	u2444	m157	BILLINGS	He's not making light.
L436364	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
L436771	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Lovely.
L436770	u2452	m157	MARION	Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
L436641	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Goodbye.
L436640	u2452	m157	MARION	Goodbye, Charlotte.
L436638	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Very well, then.
L436637	u2452	m157	MARION	Of course, I do.
L436636	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Do you?
L436635	u2452	m157	MARION	I know that.
L436634	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	I said, I'm not my sister.
L436633	u2452	m157	MARION	Excuse me?
L436210	u2452	m157	MARION	I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
L436209	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
L436208	u2452	m157	MARION	I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
L436207	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
L436206	u2452	m157	MARION	I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
L436205	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	You couldn't have known.
L436204	u2452	m157	MARION	How did this... how did I let this happen?
L435993	u2452	m157	MARION	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
L435992	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
L435980	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	As do you.
L435979	u2452	m157	MARION	You look well, Charlotte.
L435975	u2445	m157	CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
L435974	u2452	m157	MARION	They're from good stock on their mother's side.
L436139	u2457	m157	TARLETON	With a lace table cloth?
L436138	u2446	m157	CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	We did.
L436137	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Who cared for your wounds?
L436136	u2446	m157	CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
L436135	u2457	m157	TARLETON	What unit?
L436134	u2446	m157	CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	Yes, sir.
L436133	u2457	m157	TARLETON	You're surrendering.
L436529	u2452	m157	MARION	They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
L436528	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Their names, ranks and posts?
L436526	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	What officers?
L436525	u2452	m157	MARION	If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
L436524	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
L436523	u2452	m157	MARION	You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
L436522	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Sir?
L436521	u2452	m157	MARION	Prisoner exchange.
L436520	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Very well, let us move on to...
L436519	u2452	m157	MARION	As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
L436518	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
L436517	u2452	m157	MARION	I consider them linked.
L436516	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	That is a separate issue.
L436515	u2452	m157	MARION	Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
L436514	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
L436513	u2452	m157	MARION	And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
L436512	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
L436511	u2452	m157	MARION	That one is a bit more difficult.
L436510	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
L436509	u2452	m157	MARION	Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
L436508	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Thank you.
L436507	u2452	m157	MARION	I will do so as soon as possible.
L436506	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
L436505	u2452	m157	MARION	Very well, proceed, sir.
L436504	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
L436503	u2452	m157	MARION	Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
L436502	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
L436501	u2452	m157	MARION	I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
L436500	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Oh?
L436499	u2452	m157	MARION	I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
L436498	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
L436497	u2452	m157	MARION	Shall we proceed?
L436494	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	As you wish.
L436493	u2452	m157	MARION	Colonel will do.
L436492	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
L436491	u2452	m157	MARION	Apology accepted.
L436490	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
L436489	u2452	m157	MARION	My pleasure, sir.
L436488	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
L436756	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
L436755	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Do you see that, Colonel?
L436599	u2457	m157	TARLETON	I understand, sir.
L436598	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
L436597	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
L436596	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	How can we end this madness?
L436595	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Probably.
L436594	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	And if I triumph, you triumph.
L436593	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Perhaps.
L436592	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	If I fail, you fail.
L436476	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Most certainly.  Arrange it.
L436475	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Are you going to meet with him?
L436474	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
L436407	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Yes, sir.
L436406	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
L436306	u2457	m157	TARLETON	Sir.
L436305	u2447	m157	CORNWALLIS	My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
L436688	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	As you did at Fort Wilderness?
L436687	u2452	m157	MARION	If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
L436685	u2452	m157	MARION	Yes.
L436684	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I see, do as I say, not as I do.
L436683	u2452	m157	MARION	It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
L436682	u2452	m157	MARION	We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
L436681	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Go on.
L436680	u2452	m157	MARION	We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
L436677	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
L436676	u2452	m157	MARION	That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
L436675	u2452	m157	MARION	Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
L436674	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	That's not enough.  Tell me.
L436673	u2452	m157	MARION	That's right.
L436672	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
L436671	u2452	m157	MARION	And what do they know?
L436670	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
L436669	u2452	m157	MARION	Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
L436668	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	No, I don't.
L436667	u2452	m157	MARION	You know what happened.
L436666	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
L436665	u2452	m157	MARION	She is.  Don't go in there.
L436664	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
L436663	u2452	m157	MARION	Don't go in there.
L436608	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Seven homes along the Black River so far...
L436607	u2452	m157	MARION	Where?
L436606	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
L436584	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I know.
L436583	u2452	m157	MARION	It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
L436582	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Cheraw Falls.
L436581	u2452	m157	MARION	Granted.  Where are you going?
L436580	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
L436576	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
L436575	u2452	m157	MARION	What?
L436574	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
L436572	u2452	m157	MARION	She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
L436571	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
L436569	u2452	m157	MARION	I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
L436568	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
L436567	u2452	m157	MARION	She spoke?  Susan spoke?
L436464	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	She got me at a more impressionable age.
L436463	u2452	m157	MARION	You learned her lessons better than I.
L436462	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
L436461	u2452	m157	MARION	Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
L436459	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
L436458	u2452	m157	MARION	No...
L436457	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
L436456	u2452	m157	MARION	I should have killed him when I had the chance?
L436455	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
L436434	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
L436433	u2452	m157	MARION	Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
L436376	u2452	m157	MARION	Pride is his weakness.
L436375	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father?
L436374	u2452	m157	MARION	Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
L436347	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
L436346	u2452	m157	MARION	These four wagons must be his.
L436319	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I didn't see any.
L436318	u2452	m157	MARION	Flanking riders?
L436317	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
L436292	u2452	m157	MARION	God help us all when you're forty.
L436291	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	You know how old I am.
L436290	u2452	m157	MARION	How old are you?
L436289	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
L436288	u2452	m157	MARION	Is it?
L436275	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Yes...  ... father.
L436274	u2452	m157	MARION	And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
L436273	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Yes, sir.
L436272	u2452	m157	MARION	Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
L436271	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	He tried.  It didn't take.
L436270	u2452	m157	MARION	Did your father teach you humility?
L436269	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
L436268	u2452	m157	MARION	Is that so?
L436267	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
L436266	u2452	m157	MARION	Oh?
L436265	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
L436264	u2452	m157	MARION	It's safer if we stay together.
L436263	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	We'd cover more ground if we split up.
L436262	u2452	m157	MARION	We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
L436261	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	What now, sir?
L436224	u2452	m157	MARION	It's already over.
L436223	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father...
L436117	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I have no choice, I...
L436116	u2452	m157	MARION	You're in no condition to ride.
L436115	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
L436112	u2452	m157	MARION	Not yet.  What happened?
L436111	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Have you seen any Redcoats?
L436068	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Yes.
L436067	u2452	m157	MARION	Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
L436066	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
L436065	u2452	m157	MARION	When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
L436064	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
L435991	u2452	m157	MARION	Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
L435990	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
L435989	u2452	m157	MARION	And the Governor?
L435988	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
L435987	u2452	m157	MARION	Is that why the Assembly was convened?
L435986	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
L435985	u2452	m157	MARION	What news?
L435969	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
L435968	u2452	m157	MARION	Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
L435967	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
L435966	u2452	m157	MARION	The middle colonies?
L435965	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
L435942	u2452	m157	MARION	Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
L435941	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
L436566	u2456	m157	SUSAN	Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
L436565	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	You don't hate him.
L436564	u2456	m157	SUSAN	I don't care.  I hate him.
L436563	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
L436562	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
L436561	u2456	m157	SUSAN	He left us.
L436560	u2448	m157	GABRIEL	He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
L436022	u2449	m157	LEE	Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
L436021	u2455	m157	ROBINSON	I stand corrected.
L436020	u2449	m157	LEE	Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
L436007	u2449	m157	LEE	Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
L436006	u2455	m157	ROBINSON	Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
L436005	u2449	m157	LEE	Please.
L436004	u2455	m157	ROBINSON	An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
L436768	u2449	m157	LEE	Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
L436767	u2452	m157	MARION	Your son, what did you name him?
L436766	u2452	m157	MARION	I hope so.
L436765	u2449	m157	LEE	Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
L436764	u2452	m157	MARION	And congratulations on the birth of your son.
L436763	u2452	m157	MARION	Goodbye, Harry.
L436762	u2449	m157	LEE	Goodbye, Francis.
L436711	u2449	m157	LEE	No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
L436710	u2452	m157	MARION	It is ended.
L436709	u2449	m157	LEE	They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
L436708	u2452	m157	MARION	Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
L436707	u2449	m157	LEE	How many men have we seen die?
L436706	u2452	m157	MARION	Don't touch him.
L436692	u2449	m157	LEE	I'm sorry, I didn't know.
L436691	u2452	m157	MARION	His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
L436255	u2449	m157	LEE	Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
L436254	u2452	m157	MARION	How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
L436253	u2449	m157	LEE	They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
L436252	u2452	m157	MARION	They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
L436251	u2449	m157	LEE	Not held, just slowed down.
L436250	u2452	m157	MARION	You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
L436249	u2449	m157	LEE	Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
L436248	u2452	m157	MARION	So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
L436247	u2449	m157	LEE	The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
L436246	u2452	m157	MARION	Long time.
L436245	u2449	m157	LEE	Fall, six months at the earliest.
L436244	u2452	m157	MARION	When?
L436243	u2449	m157	LEE	And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
L436242	u2452	m157	MARION	So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
L436241	u2449	m157	LEE	We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
L436239	u2452	m157	MARION	What are my orders?
L436238	u2449	m157	LEE	I am, I think.
L436237	u2452	m157	MARION	Who's in command?
L436236	u2449	m157	LEE	Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
L436235	u2452	m157	MARION	Where is he now?
L436234	u2449	m157	LEE	I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
L436233	u2452	m157	MARION	We saw.
L436232	u2449	m157	LEE	There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
L436231	u2452	m157	MARION	I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
L436230	u2449	m157	LEE	I'm sorry.
L436229	u2452	m157	MARION	Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
L436074	u2452	m157	MARION	Thank you.
L436073	u2449	m157	LEE	I'll see to it that he serves under me.
L436072	u2452	m157	MARION	No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
L436071	u2449	m157	LEE	I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
L436070	u2452	m157	MARION	Gabriel.
L436069	u2449	m157	LEE	One of yours?
L436048	u2452	m157	MARION	I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
L436047	u2449	m157	LEE	And your principles?
L436046	u2452	m157	MARION	That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
L436045	u2449	m157	LEE	Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
L436041	u2449	m157	LEE	You said bribery twice...
L436040	u2452	m157	MARION	... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
L436039	u2449	m157	LEE	That's five, keep going...
L436038	u2452	m157	MARION	Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
L436037	u2449	m157	LEE	Name five hundred.
L436036	u2452	m157	MARION	There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
L436035	u2449	m157	LEE	Balderdash!
L436034	u2452	m157	MARION	We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
L436033	u2449	m157	LEE	I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
L436032	u2452	m157	MARION	You were an Englishman then...
L436030	u2449	m157	LEE	That's a damn long time...
L436029	u2452	m157	MARION	Thirteen years...
L436028	u2449	m157	LEE	A long time ago...
L436024	u2452	m157	MARION	Harry, Harry, Harry...
L436023	u2449	m157	LEE	Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
L436013	u2449	m157	LEE	I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
L436012	u2452	m157	MARION	It's Mister Marion.
L436011	u2449	m157	LEE	Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
L436483	u2450	m157	MAJOR HALBERT	Yes... you will wait.
L436482	u2452	m157	MARION	That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
L436481	u2450	m157	MAJOR HALBERT	Yes, quite, but you should know that...
L436480	u2452	m157	MARION	I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
L436479	u2450	m157	MAJOR HALBERT	You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
L436478	u2452	m157	MARION	Thank you.
L436477	u2450	m157	MAJOR HALBERT	Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
L436180	u2452	m157	MARION	Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
L436179	u2451	m157	MARGARET	But what about Thomas?
L436178	u2452	m157	MARION	Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
L436092	u2452	m157	MARION	No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
L436091	u2451	m157	MARGARET	We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
L436090	u2452	m157	MARION	Don't worry.
L436086	u2452	m157	MARION	Four, five miles.
L436085	u2451	m157	MARGARET	How far away?
L436703	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	Yes, he does.
L436702	u2452	m157	MARION	He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
L436701	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
L436650	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
L436649	u2452	m157	MARION	How many came back?
L436589	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
L436588	u2452	m157	MARION	It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
L436360	u2452	m157	MARION	Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
L436359	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
L436358	u2452	m157	MARION	For what?
L436357	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	Thank you.
L436294	u2454	m157	REV. OLIVER	I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
L436293	u2452	m157	MARION	Reverend.
L436746	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	And what is the second thing?
L436745	u2452	m157	MARION	No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
L436744	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
L436736	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
L436735	u2452	m157	MARION	Worse.
L436734	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	That bad?
L436733	u2452	m157	MARION	Remember Braddock?
L436732	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
L436725	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
L436724	u2452	m157	MARION	I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
L436723	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	I was sorry to hear about your son.
L436720	u2459	m157	WASHINGTON	Earned.
L436719	u2452	m157	MARION	Gray.
L436095	u2452	m157	MARION	Put them away.
L436094	u2458	m157	THOMAS	But father, they might come this way.
L436093	u2452	m157	MARION	Put those away.
L436079	u2452	m157	MARION	God willing.
L436078	u2458	m157	THOMAS	But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
L436077	u2452	m157	MARION	Seventeen.
L436076	u2458	m157	THOMAS	When?
L436075	u2452	m157	MARION	Not yet, Thomas.
L436197	u2453	m157	NATHAN	I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
L436196	u2452	m157	MARION	Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
L436195	u2453	m157	NATHAN	Father... I killed those men...
L436175	u2452	m157	MARION	Quiet.
L436174	u2453	m157	NATHAN	Father, you can't let them take him...
L436084	u2452	m157	MARION	Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
L436083	u2453	m157	NATHAN	Father?
L435938	u2452	m157	MARION	Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
L435937	u2453	m157	NATHAN	Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
L533280	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	We did not.
L533279	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
L533278	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
L533153	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Plenty.
L533152	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	What's wrong with him?
L533136	u2889	m190	HOFFY	They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
L533135	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	They never caught on.
L533134	u2889	m190	HOFFY	I wouldn't talk about things like that.
L533133	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
L533170	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
L533169	u2891	m190	P.O.W.S	Jawohl!
L533168	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Is you all little Adolfs?
L533167	u2891	m190	P.O.W.S	Jawohl.
L533166	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Is you all good Nazis?
L533165	u2891	m190	P.O.W.S	Jawohl.
L533474	u2892	m190	PRICE	Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
L533473	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
L533472	u2892	m190	PRICE	Don't worry. He'll be all right.
L533471	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
L533413	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
L533412	u2892	m190	PRICE	What's the match gag?
L533411	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Just pulled the old match gag, see!
L533410	u2892	m190	PRICE	Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
L533409	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
L533408	u2892	m190	PRICE	Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
L533394	u2892	m190	PRICE	He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
L533393	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	Any news on Dunbar?
L533392	u2892	m190	PRICE	We made a deal with Barrack One.
L533282	u2881	m190	BAGRADIAN	I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
L533281	u2892	m190	PRICE	Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
L533555	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Get going on the trap door.
L533554	u2882	m190	BLONDIE	Coming up.
L533553	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
L533500	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Okay. Move on.
L533499	u2882	m190	BLONDIE	Roger.
L533498	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Ready?
L532942	u2882	m190	BLONDIE	Static!
L532941	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Come on!
L532714	u2882	m190	BLONDIE	Looks good outside.
L532713	u2889	m190	HOFFY	They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
L533615	u2883	m190	COOKIE	So long, Sefton.
L533614	u2894	m190	SEFTON	So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
L533470	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Yeah. Security.
L533469	u2883	m190	COOKIE	If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
L533468	u2883	m190	COOKIE	Who is it?
L533467	u2894	m190	SEFTON	That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
L533466	u2883	m190	COOKIE	Who is it?
L533465	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
L533464	u2883	m190	COOKIE	In this barracks?
L533463	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
L533462	u2883	m190	COOKIE	I don't know anymore.
L533461	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
L533143	u2894	m190	SEFTON	We'll get some more.
L533142	u2883	m190	COOKIE	There's only one pair left.
L532735	u2894	m190	SEFTON	That'll do.
L532734	u2883	m190	COOKIE	W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
L533603	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Forget it.
L533602	u2884	m190	DUKE	Brother, were we all wet about you!
L533568	u2884	m190	DUKE	We're looking at it.
L533567	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
L533507	u2894	m190	SEFTON	No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
L533506	u2884	m190	DUKE	You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
L533505	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
L533422	u2884	m190	DUKE	Thanks.
L533421	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Have a cigar.
L533400	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Why not?
L533399	u2884	m190	DUKE	Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
L533398	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Take it.
L533397	u2884	m190	DUKE	What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
L533255	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
L533254	u2884	m190	DUKE	You make my mouth water.
L533253	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
L533252	u2884	m190	DUKE	Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
L533039	u2894	m190	SEFTON	A little something what?
L533038	u2884	m190	DUKE	And maybe a little something else?
L533037	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
L533034	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
L533033	u2884	m190	DUKE	Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
L533032	u2894	m190	SEFTON	That's right.
L533031	u2884	m190	DUKE	I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
L532944	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
L532943	u2884	m190	DUKE	Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
L532901	u2884	m190	DUKE	You stink, Sefton!
L532900	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
L532899	u2884	m190	DUKE	A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
L532898	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
L532895	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
L532894	u2884	m190	DUKE	Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
L532891	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
L532890	u2884	m190	DUKE	Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
L532823	u2884	m190	DUKE	How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
L532822	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Private property, bub.
L532748	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Anybody here wanna double their bet?
L532747	u2884	m190	DUKE	Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
L532721	u2894	m190	SEFTON	No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
L532720	u2884	m190	DUKE	Now what kind of a crack is that?
L533537	u2884	m190	DUKE	Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
L533536	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Then we're all in on it?
L533491	u2884	m190	DUKE	Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
L533490	u2889	m190	HOFFY	The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
L533229	u2884	m190	DUKE	Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
L533228	u2889	m190	HOFFY	How did he get over there?
L533043	u2889	m190	HOFFY	There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
L533042	u2884	m190	DUKE	How much more do we have to take from him?
L533041	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Break it off!
L532831	u2884	m190	DUKE	You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
L532830	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Come again?
L532741	u2884	m190	DUKE	Okay, Security -- what happened?
L532740	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
L532730	u2884	m190	DUKE	I'll call the whole pot.
L532729	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Put me down for ten, you louse.
L532970	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You are talking crazy!
L532969	u2884	m190	DUKE	That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
L532966	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Which one of you is what?
L532965	u2884	m190	DUKE	Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
L532962	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Tipping me off? I do not understand.
L532961	u2884	m190	DUKE	Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
L532759	u2884	m190	DUKE	Don't wear it out!
L532758	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
L532757	u2884	m190	DUKE	You killed them, huh? Both of them?
L533646	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Let's!
L533645	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Let's blow, Chauncey.
L533635	u2894	m190	SEFTON	We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
L533634	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	What are the chances busting out of here?
L533633	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You won't get off that cheap.
L533632	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	It's on me.
L533631	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
L533630	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Yeah.
L533629	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What some brandy?
L533628	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Not you.
L533627	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
L533626	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Sefton!
L533625	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
L533624	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	My legs are frozen.
L533623	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
L533150	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
L533149	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
L533148	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
L533116	u2894	m190	SEFTON	They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
L533115	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Twenty-five.
L533114	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
L533112	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
L533111	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
L533373	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
L533372	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
L533371	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
L533361	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
L533360	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
L533359	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
L533355	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
L533354	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
L533353	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
L533352	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	You are being rude again.
L533351	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
L533350	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
L533349	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
L533275	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Abfuehren!
L533274	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	Ever try forty sleeping pills?
L533273	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
L533272	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I'm okay here. Why bother?
L533271	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
L533270	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
L533269	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
L533268	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I'll live.
L533267	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
L533266	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	105-353.
L533265	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	What is your number?
L533264	u2885	m190	DUNBAR	I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
L533331	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
L533330	u2887	m190	GERMAN LIEUTENANT	The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
L533329	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
L533328	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
L533327	u2887	m190	GERMAN LIEUTENANT	As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
L533326	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
L533325	u2887	m190	GERMAN LIEUTENANT	Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
L533383	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
L533382	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
L533381	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	Isn't it?
L533380	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Interesting.
L533379	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
L533378	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	You were saying --?
L533376	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
L533375	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
L533374	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
L533370	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
L533369	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
L533368	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	What exactly is he charged with?
L533367	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	It is.
L533366	u2886	m190	GENEVA MAN	I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
L533365	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
L533190	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	And this?
L533189	u2888	m190	HARRY	It's a mouse trap.
L533188	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	What is this? This is water?
L532974	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Raus! Raus! All of you!
L532973	u2888	m190	HARRY	Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
L532957	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
L532956	u2888	m190	HARRY	Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
L532950	u2888	m190	HARRY	You should live so long.
L532949	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
L532948	u2888	m190	HARRY	Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
L532790	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Some are not bad at all.
L532789	u2888	m190	HARRY	Jawohl!
L532771	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
L532770	u2888	m190	HARRY	Then droppen Sie dead!
L532769	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Jawohl.
L532768	u2888	m190	HARRY	Sprechen Sie deutsch?
L532767	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Jawohl?
L532766	u2888	m190	HARRY	Say, Schulz --
L532765	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
L533541	u2888	m190	HARRY	No. I want to draw.
L533540	u2895	m190	STOSH	You want to go?
L533539	u2888	m190	HARRY	Let me do it, Hoffy.
L533488	u2888	m190	HARRY	This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
L533487	u2895	m190	STOSH	Betty! Betty!
L533486	u2888	m190	HARRY	Animal! Animal! Wake up!
L533485	u2895	m190	STOSH	I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
L533484	u2888	m190	HARRY	Hey, Animal! Animal!
L533483	u2895	m190	STOSH	But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
L533478	u2888	m190	HARRY	Why, sure!
L533477	u2895	m190	STOSH	May I have this dance, Miss?
L533457	u2895	m190	STOSH	There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
L533456	u2888	m190	HARRY	You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
L533455	u2895	m190	STOSH	It's that song, Harry!
L533454	u2888	m190	HARRY	You're crying, Animal.
L533453	u2895	m190	STOSH	Let me alone.
L533452	u2888	m190	HARRY	Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
L533429	u2895	m190	STOSH	I'll open mine, too.
L533428	u2888	m190	HARRY	I'll open mine now.
L533426	u2888	m190	HARRY	Animal! Got a little something for you!
L533425	u2895	m190	STOSH	There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
L533417	u2888	m190	HARRY	Hey, here's Esther Williams.
L533416	u2895	m190	STOSH	Do Grable.
L533407	u2888	m190	HARRY	Do Jimmy Durante!
L533406	u2895	m190	STOSH	Grable, not Gable!
L533212	u2895	m190	STOSH	Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
L533211	u2888	m190	HARRY	Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
L533197	u2895	m190	STOSH	You hold him. I'll slug him.
L533196	u2888	m190	HARRY	That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
L533093	u2888	m190	HARRY	This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
L533092	u2895	m190	STOSH	Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
L533091	u2888	m190	HARRY	So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
L533090	u2895	m190	STOSH	Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
L533089	u2888	m190	HARRY	It's not good for you, Animal.
L533088	u2895	m190	STOSH	That's what I wanna hear.
L533087	u2888	m190	HARRY	What do they always say?
L533086	u2895	m190	STOSH	What do those broads say?
L533018	u2888	m190	HARRY	Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
L533017	u2895	m190	STOSH	Harry -- I'm blind!
L533011	u2888	m190	HARRY	Bombs away!
L533010	u2895	m190	STOSH	She'll never forgive me!
L533009	u2888	m190	HARRY	To the Brick Kremlin!
L533008	u2888	m190	HARRY	Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
L533007	u2895	m190	STOSH	You did?
L533006	u2888	m190	HARRY	It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
L533005	u2895	m190	STOSH	How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
L533004	u2888	m190	HARRY	Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
L533003	u2895	m190	STOSH	You'll fix me up!
L533002	u2888	m190	HARRY	Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
L533001	u2895	m190	STOSH	Not for me! Betty! Betty!
L533000	u2888	m190	HARRY	So what? There's other women!
L532999	u2895	m190	STOSH	Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
L532993	u2895	m190	STOSH	You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
L532992	u2888	m190	HARRY	I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
L532991	u2895	m190	STOSH	Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
L532988	u2895	m190	STOSH	Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
L532987	u2888	m190	HARRY	Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
L532939	u2895	m190	STOSH	He's the grrrrreatest!
L532938	u2888	m190	HARRY	Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
L532897	u2888	m190	HARRY	He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
L532896	u2895	m190	STOSH	Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
L532887	u2888	m190	HARRY	Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
L532886	u2895	m190	STOSH	Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
L532880	u2895	m190	STOSH	It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
L532879	u2888	m190	HARRY	Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
L532876	u2895	m190	STOSH	Where'd that come from?
L532875	u2888	m190	HARRY	Easy, Animal! Easy!
L532873	u2888	m190	HARRY	No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
L532872	u2895	m190	STOSH	No?
L532871	u2888	m190	HARRY	No, Animal.
L532861	u2888	m190	HARRY	Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
L532860	u2895	m190	STOSH	You're teasing me again!
L532859	u2888	m190	HARRY	If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
L532858	u2895	m190	STOSH	Me? What if she don't want me?
L532857	u2888	m190	HARRY	What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
L532856	u2895	m190	STOSH	What's the award?
L532855	u2888	m190	HARRY	How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
L532854	u2895	m190	STOSH	Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
L532853	u2888	m190	HARRY	Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
L532852	u2888	m190	HARRY	Betty Grable!
L532851	u2895	m190	STOSH	Let me go!
L532850	u2888	m190	HARRY	You want Betty Grable!
L532849	u2895	m190	STOSH	I don't care if they wear galoshes!
L532848	u2888	m190	HARRY	No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
L532847	u2895	m190	STOSH	Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
L532846	u2888	m190	HARRY	It's chow, Animal! Chow!
L532844	u2888	m190	HARRY	They'll shoot you, Animal!
L532843	u2895	m190	STOSH	Let me go! Let me go!
L532840	u2895	m190	STOSH	Lay off! The blonde is mine!
L532839	u2888	m190	HARRY	Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
L532838	u2895	m190	STOSH	Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
L532836	u2888	m190	HARRY	Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
L532835	u2895	m190	STOSH	Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
L532821	u2895	m190	STOSH	I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
L532820	u2888	m190	HARRY	I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
L532819	u2895	m190	STOSH	You can say that again!
L532818	u2888	m190	HARRY	I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
L532817	u2895	m190	STOSH	'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
L532780	u2888	m190	HARRY	Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
L532779	u2895	m190	STOSH	I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
L532778	u2888	m190	HARRY	Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
L532777	u2895	m190	STOSH	Why do you do this to me every morning?
L532776	u2888	m190	HARRY	Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
L532775	u2895	m190	STOSH	Stop it, Harry!
L532774	u2888	m190	HARRY	Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
L532745	u2895	m190	STOSH	Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
L532744	u2888	m190	HARRY	Shut up, Animal!
L532711	u2888	m190	HARRY	Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
L532710	u2895	m190	STOSH	When you get going on those broads, think of me!
L533277	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
L533276	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
L533263	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Yes, sir.
L533262	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
L533261	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	You have a Lieutenant here...
L533260	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Yes, sir.
L533259	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
L532808	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
L532807	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
L532806	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Anything else?
L532805	u2889	m190	HOFFY	As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
L532804	u2896	m190	VON SCHERBACH	Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
L532803	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
L533559	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
L533558	u2892	m190	PRICE	Why the south latrine?
L533557	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
L533556	u2892	m190	PRICE	What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
L533548	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Any objections, men?
L533547	u2892	m190	PRICE	I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
L533546	u2889	m190	HOFFY	We've all done a poor job of it.
L533545	u2892	m190	PRICE	You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
L533544	u2889	m190	HOFFY	No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
L533514	u2889	m190	HOFFY	We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
L533513	u2892	m190	PRICE	What about Schulz?
L533504	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Good.
L533503	u2892	m190	PRICE	Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
L533502	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
L533501	u2892	m190	PRICE	I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
L533493	u2889	m190	HOFFY	I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
L533492	u2892	m190	PRICE	What are you going to do?
L533199	u2892	m190	PRICE	The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
L533198	u2889	m190	HOFFY	It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
L533157	u2892	m190	PRICE	And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
L533156	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
L533036	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
L533035	u2892	m190	PRICE	Not yet.
L532964	u2892	m190	PRICE	Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
L532963	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
L532925	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
L532924	u2892	m190	PRICE	Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
L532825	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
L532824	u2892	m190	PRICE	Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
L533437	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
L533436	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
L533182	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
L533181	u2889	m190	HOFFY	What radio?
L533180	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
L533179	u2889	m190	HOFFY	We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
L532764	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
L532763	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
L532762	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
L532761	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Los, los. Dummkopf!
L533620	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Check.
L533619	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
L533618	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You could use a new one yourself.
L533612	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Shoot!
L533611	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
L533610	u2889	m190	HOFFY	What's the decoy?
L533609	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
L533608	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
L533607	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You taking Dunbar?
L533605	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
L533604	u2889	m190	HOFFY	What are we going to do with him?
L533592	u2894	m190	SEFTON	He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
L533591	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Go on.
L533580	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
L533579	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You off your rocker?
L533578	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You did!
L533577	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Who did?
L533576	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You told them, Hoffy.
L533575	u2889	m190	HOFFY	How do they know?
L533572	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I called it the last time, didn't I?
L533571	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
L533570	u2894	m190	SEFTON	That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
L533569	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
L533563	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Anybody cover?
L533562	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You starting that again?
L533561	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
L533512	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Okay, Price. You stay.
L533511	u2894	m190	SEFTON	So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
L533510	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Right.
L533509	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
L533508	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
L533322	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
L533321	u2889	m190	HOFFY	You heard that, Sefton?
L533257	u2894	m190	SEFTON	It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
L533256	u2889	m190	HOFFY	What's it add up to you, Sefton?
L533249	u2894	m190	SEFTON	There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
L533248	u2889	m190	HOFFY	We did it.
L533247	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
L533242	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Borscht?
L533241	u2889	m190	HOFFY	I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
L533240	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
L533119	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
L533118	u2894	m190	SEFTON	With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
L533117	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Lay off, Sefton.
L533028	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
L533027	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
L533026	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Says me.
L533025	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Says who?
L533024	u2889	m190	HOFFY	What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
L532935	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Are we boring you?
L532934	u2894	m190	SEFTON	If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
L532889	u2894	m190	SEFTON	A little weak today.
L532888	u2889	m190	HOFFY	If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
L532725	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
L532724	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Anybody call?
L532706	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
L532705	u2889	m190	HOFFY	Stay out of it, Sefton.
L533068	u2895	m190	STOSH	Oh.
L533067	u2890	m190	MARKO	Give this to Joey, will you?
L533066	u2895	m190	STOSH	Yeah?
L533063	u2895	m190	STOSH	Just what makes you so popular?
L533062	u2890	m190	MARKO	Shapiro. Shapiro.
L533061	u2895	m190	STOSH	Nothing for Kuzawa?
L533060	u2890	m190	MARKO	Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
L532916	u2890	m190	MARKO	At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
L532915	u2895	m190	STOSH	You can tell Father Murray to --
L532914	u2890	m190	MARKO	Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
L533598	u2894	m190	SEFTON	The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
L533597	u2892	m190	PRICE	The what?
L533590	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
L533589	u2892	m190	PRICE	Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
L533588	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What time?
L533587	u2892	m190	PRICE	December seventh, forty-one.
L533586	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
L533585	u2892	m190	PRICE	I'll kill you for that!
L533584	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
L533583	u2892	m190	PRICE	Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
L533582	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
L533581	u2892	m190	PRICE	No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
L533574	u2894	m190	SEFTON	The Germans know where Dunbar is.
L533573	u2892	m190	PRICE	Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
L533531	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
L533530	u2892	m190	PRICE	Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
L533529	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
L533528	u2892	m190	PRICE	What did you say?
L533527	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Ach so!
L533526	u2894	m190	SEFTON	A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
L533525	u2892	m190	PRICE	Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
L533524	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
L533523	u2892	m190	PRICE	Are you questioning me?
L533522	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
L533521	u2892	m190	PRICE	Thirty-fifth.
L533520	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
L533519	u2892	m190	PRICE	Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
L533518	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
L533517	u2892	m190	PRICE	Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
L533516	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
L533251	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What about the radio?
L533250	u2892	m190	PRICE	So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
L533030	u2894	m190	SEFTON	They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
L533029	u2892	m190	PRICE	When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
L532908	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
L532907	u2892	m190	PRICE	They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
L532906	u2894	m190	SEFTON	And what's that crack supposed to mean?
L532905	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
L532904	u2892	m190	PRICE	Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
L532903	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
L533446	u2892	m190	PRICE	Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
L533445	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Wie hat er's gemacht?
L533444	u2892	m190	PRICE	Ich weiss alles.
L533443	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
L533186	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
L533185	u2892	m190	PRICE	We have no radio.
L533184	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Give me the radio.
L533183	u2892	m190	PRICE	Schulz, you're off your nut!
L532968	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
L532967	u2892	m190	PRICE	Which one of us is the informer?
L532786	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
L532785	u2892	m190	PRICE	Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
L532784	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
L532756	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
L532755	u2892	m190	PRICE	Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
L533439	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Not particularly.
L533438	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
L533307	u2894	m190	SEFTON	How many do you want? A thousand?
L533306	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Talk what? I do not know anything!
L533305	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
L533304	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	No! No!
L533303	u2894	m190	SEFTON	I'll make it five hundred!
L533302	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Yes, you do!
L533301	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	I do not want those cigarettes.
L533300	u2894	m190	SEFTON	The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
L533299	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	What guy?
L533298	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Who's the guy, Schulz?
L533297	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
L533296	u2894	m190	SEFTON	And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
L533295	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
L533294	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Here. Take them.
L533293	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
L533292	u2894	m190	SEFTON	How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
L533291	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
L532972	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
L532971	u2894	m190	SEFTON	No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
L532783	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Fine -- fine!
L532782	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
L532781	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Good morning, Sefton.
L533192	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
L533191	u2895	m190	STOSH	My grandmother's ear-muffs.
L533178	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
L533177	u2895	m190	STOSH	We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
L533176	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
L532960	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
L532959	u2895	m190	STOSH	Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
L532958	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
L532955	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
L532954	u2895	m190	STOSH	Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
L532953	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	That is my wife.
L532952	u2895	m190	STOSH	Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
L532951	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	This is me in Cincinnati.
L532947	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
L532946	u2895	m190	STOSH	Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
L532945	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
L532792	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
L532791	u2895	m190	STOSH	Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
L532788	u2893	m190	SCHULTZ	Russian women prisoners?
L532787	u2895	m190	STOSH	Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
L533617	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
L533616	u2895	m190	STOSH	You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
L533596	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
L533595	u2895	m190	STOSH	You heard him.
L533316	u2895	m190	STOSH	Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
L533315	u2894	m190	SEFTON	So you're stuck with me, eh?
L533244	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Oh! Somebody was peeking!
L533243	u2895	m190	STOSH	Have a nice time over there?
L533056	u2895	m190	STOSH	Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
L533055	u2894	m190	SEFTON	You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
L532893	u2894	m190	SEFTON	What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
L532892	u2895	m190	STOSH	That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
L532883	u2894	m190	SEFTON	Just don't drool on it.
L532882	u2895	m190	STOSH	Is it all right if we smell it?
L532878	u2895	m190	STOSH	A chicken?
L532877	u2894	m190	SEFTON	From a chicken, bug-wit.
L48089	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --

L48041	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah --
L48040	u3742	m247	AGENT	You came in on that boat, didn't you?
L48405	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What is this?
L48404	u3743	m247	AUSTRALIAN	Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
L48403	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Moonby what?
L48402	u3743	m247	AUSTRALIAN	Moonby. Got any Winstons?
L48401	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Who the hell are you?
L48396	u3743	m247	AUSTRALIAN	I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
L48395	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We've been attacked.
L47660	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Who are you ?
L47659	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
L47655	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
L47654	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	A year ? Waiter another beer.
L47653	u3763	m247	WILLARD	A long time.
L47652	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	How long were you up there ?
L47651	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We do.
L47650	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
L47649	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
L47648	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
L47647	u3763	m247	WILLARD	At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
L47646	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Sometimes.
L47645	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Fat. That's real fat.
L47644	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Yeah.
L47643	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Tracks ?
L47642	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	I was an FO for the 25th.
L47641	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Let's talk about you.
L47640	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	That's quite an array of ribbons...
L47639	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
L47638	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Were you Longe Range Recon --
L47637	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Sort of.
L47636	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Rangers, eh?
L47635	u3763	m247	WILLARD	None.
L47634	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	What unit were you with ?
L47633	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah. Way north.
L47632	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	North ?
L47631	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No.
L47630	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Delta ?
L47629	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
L47628	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	That's good gin.
L47627	u3763	m247	WILLARD	My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
L47626	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Which part is that ?
L47625	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Part.
L47624	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	Winning the war by yourself.
L47623	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Sure, thanks.
L47622	u3744	m247	CAPTAIN	How about a drink ?
L48350	u3748	m247	CLEAN	What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
L48349	u3745	m247	CHEF	Holy shit.
L47769	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
L47768	u3745	m247	CHEF	Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
L47767	u3748	m247	CLEAN	He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
L47766	u3745	m247	CHEF	So what happened ?
L47761	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
L47760	u3745	m247	CHEF	It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
L48477	u3745	m247	CHEF	You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
L48476	u3763	m247	WILLARD	... he's an amazing officer.
L48475	u3745	m247	CHEF	I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
L48474	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah, I know.
L48473	u3745	m247	CHEF	This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
L48470	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
L48469	u3745	m247	CHEF	When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
L48468	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Not a thing.
L48467	u3745	m247	CHEF	He killed that guy without feeling anything.
L48464	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
L48463	u3745	m247	CHEF	What are we doing here?
L48462	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I know.
L48461	u3745	m247	CHEF	Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
L48400	u3763	m247	WILLARD	God knows.
L48399	u3745	m247	CHEF	Who's he?
L48398	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Looks that way.
L48397	u3745	m247	CHEF	Charlie?
L48223	u3745	m247	CHEF	Yeah, it is.
L48222	u3763	m247	WILLARD	That's a light down there --
L48220	u3745	m247	CHEF	Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
L48219	u3763	m247	WILLARD	And the grass?
L48218	u3745	m247	CHEF	Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
L48217	u3763	m247	WILLARD	How much is left?
L48216	u3745	m247	CHEF	There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
L48204	u3763	m247	WILLARD	That we're dumber than we look.
L48203	u3745	m247	CHEF	Whatdoya think it thinks.
L48202	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Probably is.
L48201	u3745	m247	CHEF	I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
L48199	u3745	m247	CHEF	I don't know.
L48198	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What do you see?
L48098	u3745	m247	CHEF	I don't believe you --
L48097	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
L48096	u3745	m247	CHEF	No shit.
L48095	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
L48007	u3745	m247	CHEF	They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
L48006	u3763	m247	WILLARD	How?
L48005	u3745	m247	CHEF	Cook school -- that did it.
L48004	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What are you doing out here?
L48003	u3745	m247	CHEF	That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
L48002	u3763	m247	WILLARD	A sauciere --
L48001	u3745	m247	CHEF	No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
L48000	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
L47999	u3745	m247	CHEF	Call me what, sir?
L47998	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Why they call you that?
L47997	u3745	m247	CHEF	Yes, sir --
L47996	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Chef.
L47732	u3745	m247	CHEF	I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
L47731	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Arch light.
L48356	u3746	m247	CHIEF	No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
L48355	u3745	m247	CHEF	Flood.
L48238	u3745	m247	CHEF	Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
L48237	u3746	m247	CHIEF	What'd he say?
L48208	u3745	m247	CHEF	Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
L48207	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
L48021	u3745	m247	CHEF	Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
L48020	u3746	m247	CHIEF	You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
L47982	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
L47981	u3745	m247	CHEF	Can I go get those mangos now?
L48382	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Looks pretty shallow.
L48381	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Who knows? Right.
L48380	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Which way? Right or left?
L48379	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
L48374	u3763	m247	WILLARD	If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
L48373	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Will they attack?
L48369	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Listen.
L48368	u3746	m247	CHIEF	What is it?
L48367	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Listen.
L48365	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah -- like keep out --
L48364	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Signs?
L48363	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
L48362	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Thta's not Charlie's work --
L48361	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
L48353	u3763	m247	WILLARD	While you were sleeping.
L48352	u3746	m247	CHIEF	When'd you do it?
L48351	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
L48249	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
L48248	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I --
L48228	u3746	m247	CHIEF	We're Americans.
L48227	u3763	m247	WILLARD	They're not Cong.
L48225	u3763	m247	WILLARD	In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
L48224	u3746	m247	CHIEF	What the hell is it?
L48195	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
L48194	u3746	m247	CHIEF	This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
L48193	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Get in there !
L48192	u3746	m247	CHIEF	This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
L48191	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Well, get in there.
L48190	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
L48189	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
L48188	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Who knows what's up there?
L48187	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
L48184	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
L48183	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
L48101	u3746	m247	CHIEF	No shit -- hot damn --
L48100	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
L48099	u3746	m247	CHIEF	What're you trying to say, Captain --
L48094	u3763	m247	WILLARD	All right I got a little surprise for you --
L48093	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
L47994	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'll go with him --
L47993	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
L47844	u3746	m247	CHIEF	The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
L47843	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
L47778	u3763	m247	WILLARD	First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
L47777	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
L47775	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Where ?
L47774	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Smoke !
L47730	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
L47729	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Shot himself. What for ?
L47728	u3746	m247	CHIEF	'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
L47727	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
L47726	u3746	m247	CHIEF	The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
L47725	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Let's go.
L47724	u3746	m247	CHIEF	All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
L47723	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
L47722	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
L47991	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I wonder if that was the same copter.
L47990	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
L47930	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
L47929	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
L47928	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
L47771	u3748	m247	CLEAN	He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
L47770	u3746	m247	CHIEF	They nail him for it bad ?
L47765	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
L47764	u3746	m247	CHIEF	I never heard about that.
L47763	u3748	m247	CLEAN	One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
L47762	u3746	m247	CHIEF	What cat  ?
L47734	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Too far inland.
L47733	u3746	m247	CHIEF	Anybody see some smoke ?
L47721	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	Terminate with extreme prejudice.
L47720	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Terminate ?
L47719	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
L47718	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
L47717	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
L47716	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Touchy.
L47715	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	Ours.
L47714	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Our Recon flight ?
L47711	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
L47710	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	What does that mean ?
L47700	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Anyone got a cigarette.
L47699	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	You didn't like him.
L47697	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Maybe.
L47696	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	Would he remember you ?
L47695	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I only met Kurtz once.
L47658	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Whose orders ?
L47657	u3747	m247	CIVILIAN	If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
L47656	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What do you want ?
L48182	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
L48181	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Charlie?
L48180	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Spooky.
L48178	u3748	m247	CLEAN	We ain't goin' down the river.
L48177	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
L48174	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Nobody comes in here.
L48173	u3748	m247	CLEAN	What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
L48172	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
L48170	u3748	m247	CLEAN	What is it?
L48169	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Do me a favor buddy, please.
L48168	u3748	m247	CLEAN	Yeah, it still runs.
L48167	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
L48555	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah.
L48554	u3749	m247	COLBY	Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
L48553	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah.
L48550	u3763	m247	WILLARD	They must have seen the fire.
L48549	u3749	m247	COLBY	How did they know?
L48539	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
L48538	u3749	m247	COLBY	Who is he?
L48437	u3749	m247	COLBY	NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
L48436	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Charlie?
L48435	u3749	m247	COLBY	What -- happened here.
L47709	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Maybe.
L47708	u3750	m247	COLONEL	Well, he's killing now.
L47707	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
L47706	u3750	m247	COLONEL	But why ?
L47705	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
L47704	u3750	m247	COLONEL	About what ?
L47703	u3763	m247	WILLARD	This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
L47702	u3750	m247	COLONEL	A lame ?
L47701	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I thought he was a lame.
L47688	u3750	m247	COLONEL	He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
L47687	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah.
L47673	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
L47672	u3750	m247	COLONEL	You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
L47670	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
L47669	u3750	m247	COLONEL	I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
L47668	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No, sir.
L47667	u3750	m247	COLONEL	This gentleman or myself ?
L47666	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No, sir.
L47664	u3750	m247	COLONEL	Okay, Willard, sit down.
L47663	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
L48347	u3751	m247	GASTON	We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
L48346	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
L48343	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Your daughter.
L48342	u3751	m247	GASTON	Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
L48304	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What about an American named Kurtz?
L48303	u3751	m247	GASTON	When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
L48302	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Do you know that jungle?
L48301	u3751	m247	GASTON	Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
L48297	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
L48296	u3751	m247	GASTON	But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
L48295	u3763	m247	WILLARD	The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
L48294	u3751	m247	GASTON	We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
L48293	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You'll get blown outta here some day.
L48292	u3751	m247	GASTON	Captain?
L48291	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
L48290	u3751	m247	GASTON	Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
L48277	u3751	m247	GASTON	No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
L48276	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
L48275	u3751	m247	GASTON	It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
L48266	u3751	m247	GASTON	Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
L48265	u3763	m247	WILLARD	A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
L48264	u3751	m247	GASTON	A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
L48263	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We don't want to bother you any, we --
L48261	u3751	m247	GASTON	We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
L48260	u3763	m247	WILLARD	American weapons?
L48255	u3751	m247	GASTON	Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
L48254	u3763	m247	WILLARD	As I said, we can pay you in gold.
L48253	u3751	m247	GASTON	Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
L47950	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
L47949	u3755	m247	LANCE	Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
L47943	u3755	m247	LANCE	What?
L47942	u3752	m247	KILGORE	The wind --
L47938	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
L47937	u3755	m247	LANCE	What?
L47936	u3752	m247	KILGORE	You smell that.  You smell that?
L47911	u3755	m247	LANCE	Sure -- fine --
L47910	u3752	m247	KILGORE	They far enough?
L47907	u3755	m247	LANCE	I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
L47906	u3752	m247	KILGORE	You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
L47893	u3752	m247	KILGORE	I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
L47892	u3755	m247	LANCE	What, sir?
L47891	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Good swell.
L47802	u3752	m247	KILGORE	That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
L47801	u3755	m247	LANCE	I haven't surfed since I got here.
L47800	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Where've you been riding, Lance?
L47793	u3752	m247	KILGORE	You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
L47792	u3755	m247	LANCE	Thank you, sir.
L47791	u3752	m247	KILGORE	It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
L47790	u3755	m247	LANCE	That's right, sir.
L47789	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Lance Johnson? The surfer?
L47788	u3755	m247	LANCE	Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
L47787	u3752	m247	KILGORE	What's your name, sailor ?
L47903	u3752	m247	KILGORE	You want'a surf, soldier?
L47902	u3757	m247	MIKE	It's still pretty hairy, sir.
L47901	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
L47900	u3757	m247	MIKE	Wh -- what?

L47839	u3757	m247	MIKE	Six to eight feet.
L47838	u3752	m247	KILGORE	How big it is?
L47837	u3757	m247	MIKE	It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
L47836	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
L47834	u3757	m247	MIKE	It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
L47833	u3752	m247	KILGORE	What do you mean?
L47832	u3757	m247	MIKE	Boss left.
L47831	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?

L47855	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Music?
L47854	u3752	m247	KILGORE	We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
L47829	u3752	m247	KILGORE	What about this point here?
L47828	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You'll find enough Cong up there.
L47827	u3752	m247	KILGORE	You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
L47826	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I met him.
L47825	u3752	m247	KILGORE	And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
L47824	u3763	m247	WILLARD	So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
L47823	u3752	m247	KILGORE	I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
L47822	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Hairy ?
L47821	u3752	m247	KILGORE	That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
L47820	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
L47819	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Don't you agree?
L47818	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I met him.
L47817	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
L47816	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Who knows.
L47815	u3752	m247	KILGORE	'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
L47814	u3763	m247	WILLARD	When did you hear?
L47813	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
L47812	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
L47811	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Can you trust them?
L47810	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
L47809	u3752	m247	KILGORE	What'd you do for supplies?
L47808	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No. Walked.
L47807	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
L47806	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Haiphong.
L47805	u3752	m247	KILGORE	What's the furthest you been in?
L47804	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I got bored in Saigon.
L47803	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
L47796	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
L47795	u3763	m247	WILLARD	My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
L47784	u3752	m247	KILGORE	Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
L47783	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
L48546	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm taking you back.
L48545	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Yes...
L48544	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You had immense plans... immense plans...
L48543	u3753	m247	KURTZ	My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
L48537	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I was on threshold of great things.
L48536	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm gonna get you out of here.
L48535	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I had immense plans.
L48534	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm taking you back. You can still live.
L48533	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Going back  - to the jungle to die.
L48532	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What are you doing?
L48531	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Go away -- hide yourself.
L48520	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We'll exterminate the fuckers !
L48519	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
L48518	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Fuck no.
L48517	u3753	m247	KURTZ	You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
L48516	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
L48515	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Oh Captain, that is so true.
L48514	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I think think a lie stinks.
L48513	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
L48512	u3763	m247	WILLARD	How did we get here?
L48506	u3753	m247	KURTZ	You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
L48505	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No water.
L48504	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Gimme water.
L48503	u3753	m247	KURTZ	The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
L48502	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What Truth?
L48501	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
L48500	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I can handle it.
L48499	u3753	m247	KURTZ	How's yours?
L48498	u3763	m247	WILLARD	How's the pain?
L48497	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
L48496	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You can't have water after morphine.
L48495	u3753	m247	KURTZ	No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
L48489	u3753	m247	KURTZ	No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
L48488	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You've gone crazy.
L48487	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I love it.
L48486	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah, I like it...
L48485	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Do you?
L48484	u3753	m247	KURTZ	That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
L48483	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
L48482	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
L48466	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yeah.
L48465	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
L48458	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Yes.
L48457	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Do you know me?
L48454	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You know you're right.
L48453	u3753	m247	KURTZ	What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
L48452	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What do you mean, Colonel?
L48451	u3753	m247	KURTZ	You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
L48450	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No -- no, sir.
L48449	u3753	m247	KURTZ	You were not coming here, to see me?
L48448	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
L48447	u3753	m247	KURTZ	Why did you come to ... my province.
L48445	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
L48444	u3753	m247	KURTZ	I'm Kurtz.
L48443	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
L48575	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
L48574	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	Were you with him, when...
L48573	u3763	m247	WILLARD	His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
L48572	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
L48571	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Both of us...
L48570	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
L48569	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yes, I know...
L48568	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
L48567	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You knew him best.
L48566	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
L48565	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
L48564	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	And you admired him?
L48563	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You get to know each other pretty well out there.
L48562	u3754	m247	KURTZ'S WIFE	Did you know him very well?
L48427	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
L48426	u3755	m247	LANCE	What?
L48360	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No -- leave it --
L48359	u3755	m247	LANCE	The other one --
L48016	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I wasn't looking.. I was running.
L48015	u3755	m247	LANCE	You think?
L48014	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
L48013	u3755	m247	LANCE	What's this tiger shit?
L47986	u3763	m247	WILLARD	It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
L47985	u3755	m247	LANCE	And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
L47984	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Sure.
L47983	u3755	m247	LANCE	Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
L47980	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
L47979	u3755	m247	LANCE	A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
L47978	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
L47977	u3755	m247	LANCE	Any time -- us -- Americans.
L47976	u3763	m247	WILLARD	When?
L47975	u3755	m247	LANCE	You think he'd of shot us?
L47974	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
L47973	u3755	m247	LANCE	You hear it again?
L47967	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
L47966	u3755	m247	LANCE	Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
L47963	u3755	m247	LANCE	Yeah, Jesus Christ !
L47962	u3763	m247	WILLARD	This one , Lance?
L47960	u3755	m247	LANCE	The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
L47959	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Which one's the Colonel's?
L47958	u3755	m247	LANCE	No -- no, Captain.
L47957	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Then let's get the hell out of here.
L47956	u3755	m247	LANCE	Nah.
L47955	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
L47954	u3755	m247	LANCE	Yeah... thanks.
L47953	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Are you finished surfing?
L47935	u3763	m247	WILLARD	He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
L47934	u3755	m247	LANCE	He'll kill us.
L47920	u3755	m247	LANCE	Just something I read in the Free Press.
L47919	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What's that?
L47915	u3755	m247	LANCE	Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
L47914	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What?
L47913	u3755	m247	LANCE	Maybe he'll get tubed.
L48129	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
L48128	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What is this bridge?
L48127	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
L48126	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
L48125	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
L48124	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Why?
L48123	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
L48122	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
L48121	u3763	m247	WILLARD	That's me.
L48120	u3756	m247	LIEUTENANT	Captain Willard?
L48432	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
L48431	u3758	m247	MOONBY	His name is...
L48430	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Who are you?
L48429	u3763	m247	WILLARD	And shut up.
L48428	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Right on -- he's been waiting for --
L48425	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
L48424	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
L48423	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
L48422	u3758	m247	MOONBY	No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
L48421	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Sounds like he's gone crazy.
L48418	u3758	m247	MOONBY	I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
L48417	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Why didn't he shoot you?
L48416	u3758	m247	MOONBY	But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
L48415	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
L48414	u3763	m247	WILLARD	So Kurtz is alive.
L48413	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
L48412	u3763	m247	WILLARD	You're Australian?
L48411	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Simple. They don't want him to go.
L48410	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Why did they attack us?
L48409	u3758	m247	MOONBY	Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
L48408	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
L48407	u3758	m247	MOONBY	This boat's a mess.
L48341	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
L48340	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What if I say no.
L48339	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
L48338	u3763	m247	WILLARD	So that's it.
L48337	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
L48336	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
L48332	u3763	m247	WILLARD	The river is beautiful.
L48331	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Are you warm, Captain?
L48329	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
L48328	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I know.
L48327	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
L48326	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Yes.
L48325	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
L48324	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What things?
L48323	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
L48322	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What did you hear?
L48321	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Yes.
L48320	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
L48319	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	What's a big question?
L48318	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
L48317	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	What will you do after the war?
L48315	u3763	m247	WILLARD	No. Not really.
L48314	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
L48312	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	The war will still be here tomorrow.
L48311	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I should be checking on the boat.
L48310	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	Cognac?
L48309	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I'm sorry to hear that.
L48308	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
L48300	u3763	m247	WILLARD	We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
L48299	u3760	m247	ROXANNE	May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
L47758	u3761	m247	SERGEANT	No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
L47757	u3763	m247	WILLARD	This -- Bob Hope or the like --
L47756	u3761	m247	SERGEANT	Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
L47755	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What show ?
L47752	u3763	m247	WILLARD	I do.
L47751	u3761	m247	SERGEANT	Well who the hell verifies that ?
L47750	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Right now -- I am.
L47749	u3761	m247	SERGEANT	Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
L47748	u3763	m247	WILLARD	They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
L47747	u3761	m247	SERGEANT	I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
L48142	u3763	m247	WILLARD	C'mon --
L48141	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
L48140	u3763	m247	WILLARD	What?
L48139	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Beverly Hills --
L48138	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Where's your chief supply officer?
L48137	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Son of a bitch, sir.
L48136	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	You came right to it, son of a bitch --
L48036	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
L48035	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Well , who's in command here?
L48034	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
L48033	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
L47889	u3763	m247	WILLARD	Anyone got a card?
L47888	u3762	m247	SOLDIER	That's 27, sir.
L99031	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
L99030	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
L98958	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
L98957	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
L98956	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	And you believe the NLF?
L98955	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
L98952	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	No. It has failed in its objective.
L98951	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	The strike is a success; but ...
L98950	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
L99037	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	"And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences."
L99036	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
L99035	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	"Let's try to be precise then. The word ""torture"" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?"
L99034	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
L99033	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	I understand. What's your question?
L99032	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
L98966	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	It depends on you.
L98965	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	And here?
L98964	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
L98963	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Exactly.
L98962	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	Dien Bien Phu?
L98961	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
L98993	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
L98992	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Third group. What's your assignment?
L98991	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Third group.
L98990	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	"What ""group""?"
L98989	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
L98988	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Second district ... Explain better ...
L98987	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Second district ...
L98986	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	"Which ""district"" do you belong to?"
L98985	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Sail.
L98984	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Second name.
L98983	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Sid Ahmed.
L98982	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
L98763	u4148	m277	ALI	You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
L98762	u4154	m277	HACENE	What ... What must I decide?
L98761	u4148	m277	ALI	They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
L98760	u4154	m277	HACENE	How much are they paying you?
L98757	u4148	m277	ALI	The NLF has condemned you to death.
L98756	u4154	m277	HACENE	What's happened to you?
L98755	u4148	m277	ALI	It's true.
L98754	u4154	m277	HACENE	Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
L98753	u4148	m277	ALI	Don't move, Hacene.
L98752	u4154	m277	HACENE	You afraid of these ...?
L99014	u4155	m277	KADER	No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
L99013	u4148	m277	ALI	No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
L99012	u4155	m277	KADER	Of course. As soon as possible.
L99011	u4148	m277	ALI	Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
L99010	u4155	m277	KADER	It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
L98904	u4155	m277	KADER	No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
L98903	u4148	m277	ALI	Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
L98733	u4155	m277	KADER	Not enough.
L98732	u4148	m277	ALI	And how many are we?
L98731	u4155	m277	KADER	Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
L98730	u4148	m277	ALI	You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
L98729	u4155	m277	KADER	Then don't complain.
L98728	u4148	m277	ALI	I don't do that kind of thing.
L98727	u4155	m277	KADER	C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
L98726	u4148	m277	ALI	What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
L98725	u4155	m277	KADER	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
L98724	u4148	m277	ALI	But I haven't shot him.
L98723	u4155	m277	KADER	My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
L98722	u4148	m277	ALI	I don't even know your name yet ...
L98721	u4155	m277	KADER	Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
L98720	u4148	m277	ALI	Sure. By shooting at me.
L98719	u4155	m277	KADER	Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
L98718	u4155	m277	KADER	I'll explain.
L98717	u4148	m277	ALI	With an unloaded pistol?
L98829	u4148	m277	ALI	Go away.
L98828	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
L98827	u4148	m277	ALI	Where's Kader?
L98699	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Here?
L98698	u4148	m277	ALI	Read it.
L98697	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Sure ...
L98696	u4148	m277	ALI	Can you read?
L98690	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
L98689	u4148	m277	ALI	Go away!
L98931	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
L98930	u4148	m277	ALI	To show them to the UN, right?
L98929	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
L98928	u4148	m277	ALI	Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
L98927	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Why?
L98926	u4148	m277	ALI	No, and neither were my men.
L98925	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
L98924	u4148	m277	ALI	No ...
L98923	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
L98922	u4148	m277	ALI	It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
L98921	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
L98920	u4148	m277	ALI	I think it'll be a success ...
L98919	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	What do you think of the strike, Ali?
L98916	u4148	m277	ALI	It's a question of habit ...
L98915	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	It's good nobody is following us ...
L98914	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Let's try ...
L98913	u4148	m277	ALI	Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
L98811	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
L98810	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
L98809	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
L98808	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	But it's not even midnight yet!
L98807	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
L98806	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	Good evening ... Can we pass?
L98794	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Good evening, sir.
L98793	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
L98792	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Rue de Th?bes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
L98791	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Tell me ... Where is this rue de Th?bes?
L98790	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Good evening, sir.
L98789	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
L98771	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
L98770	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Where were we?
L99127	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
L99126	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
L99123	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Let's hope forever.
L99122	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
L99121	u4153	m277	GENERAL	And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
L98891	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Yes, a name for the operation.
L98890	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	A name?
L98889	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
L99081	u4155	m277	KADER	She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
L99080	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	What is she saying?
L99079	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
L99078	u4155	m277	KADER	That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
L99077	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Of course I am.
L99076	u4155	m277	KADER	You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
L99075	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
L99074	u4155	m277	KADER	Why?
L99055	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Yes ... But let me first see you.
L99054	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Are you ready, colonel?
L99052	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
L99051	u4157	m277	MOURAD	We'll lower a basket from the window ...
L99050	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	How can I give you this statement?
L99049	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
L99047	u4157	m277	MOURAD	We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
L99046	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
L99045	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Who is speaking?
L160903	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.

L160868	u4803	m320	JOHN	Who's going?
L160867	u4797	m320	ALBERT	John,we're going huntin'.
L160866	u4803	m320	JOHN	Yes, Albert?
L160797	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Fuckin' A!
L160796	u4803	m320	JOHN	Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
L160542	u4803	m320	JOHN	Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
L160541	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
L160533	u4803	m320	JOHN	I mean let's get going before --
L160532	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Get the boots.
L160531	u4803	m320	JOHN	I'll get the boots.
L160488	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Good... Pass the beer.
L160487	u4803	m320	JOHN	You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
L160486	u4797	m320	ALBERT	What?
L160485	u4803	m320	JOHN	That's mustard!
L160483	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
L160482	u4803	m320	JOHN	Damn right!

L160480	u4803	m320	JOHN	Those are mine!
L160479	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Fuel up. Need fuel.
L160469	u4797	m320	ALBERT	I know...
L160468	u4803	m320	JOHN	Fucking women, man...
L160467	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Yeah.
L160466	u4803	m320	JOHN	She fucked us both.
L160465	u4797	m320	ALBERT	She fucked me too.
L160464	u4803	m320	JOHN	She fucked you?
L160463	u4797	m320	ALBERT	She fucked me too.
L160462	u4803	m320	JOHN	She fucked me.
L160461	u4797	m320	ALBERT	She fucked you?
L160929	u4797	m320	ALBERT	She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
L160928	u4812	m320	VINCE	She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
L160927	u4797	m320	ALBERT	In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
L160926	u4812	m320	VINCE	In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
L160925	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
L160924	u4812	m320	VINCE	She does not!
L160923	u4797	m320	ALBERT	I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
L160922	u4812	m320	VINCE	I do!!!
L160921	u4797	m320	ALBERT	You don't!
L160920	u4812	m320	VINCE	I know! I fuckin' know!
L160919	u4797	m320	ALBERT	You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
L160918	u4812	m320	VINCE	Who? Who is?
L160917	u4797	m320	ALBERT	You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
L160894	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
L160893	u4812	m320	VINCE	Let's go!!!
L160790	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Vince thinks... you know...
L160789	u4812	m320	VINCE	Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
L160780	u4812	m320	VINCE	Well... you remember Cynthia?
L160779	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Tell him, Vince!
L160769	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
L160768	u4812	m320	VINCE	What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
L160767	u4797	m320	ALBERT	I know, but...
L160766	u4812	m320	VINCE	Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
L160763	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Yeah.
L160762	u4812	m320	VINCE	Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
L160761	u4812	m320	VINCE	Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!

L160759	u4812	m320	VINCE	What the --!
L160720	u4812	m320	VINCE	It's gotta!
L160719	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
L160718	u4812	m320	VINCE	It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
L160714	u4812	m320	VINCE	So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
L160713	u4797	m320	ALBERT	I thought that was it.
L160505	u4797	m320	ALBERT	Jesus, it's freezing!
L160504	u4812	m320	VINCE	They did too!
L160503	u4797	m320	ALBERT	They did not!
L160502	u4812	m320	VINCE	I'm telling you, they changed it!
L160501	u4797	m320	ALBERT	You're full of shit!
L160500	u4812	m320	VINCE	Who's full of shit?
L160499	u4797	m320	ALBERT	You're full of shit.
L160498	u4812	m320	VINCE	This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.

The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
L184715	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Tell me about your garden.
L184714	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
L184713	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I know.
L184712	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I'm sorry, Katharine.
L184711	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
L184710	u5046	m334	ALMSY	And a good read.  Don't waste it.
L184709	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
L184708	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
L184707	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
L184706	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Oh dear.
L184705	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Yes.  Absolutely.
L184704	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
L184703	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I'm just going to find things for the fire.
L184702	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Don't leave me!
L184701	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
L184700	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	It's so cold.
L184699	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
L184698	u5046	m334	ALMSY	You're wearing the thimble.
L184697	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
L184696	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Don't talk.
L184695	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
L184694	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What?
L184693	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Why did you hate me?
L184692	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I know, darling, I'm sorry.
L184691	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	It hurts too much.
L184690	u5046	m334	ALMSY	We've got to get you out of here.
L184689	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
L184687	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	A surprise, he said.
L184686	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Why did he bring you?
L184685	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I can't move.  I can't get out.
L184684	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
L184592	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
L184591	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
L184590	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	No.
L184589	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Dance with me.
L184588	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
L184587	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
L184586	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Don't do this.
L184585	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
L184584	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Would you let me pass?
L184583	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
L184582	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What?
L184581	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Why did you hold his collar?
L184487	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You will.  You will.
L184486	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
L184484	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Don't go over it again, please.
L184483	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
L184482	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
L184481	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
L184406	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
L184405	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
L184404	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
L184403	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	That day, had you followed me to the market?
L184402	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
L184398	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Yes.  A different wife.
L184397	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
L184396	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
L184395	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
L184394	u5046	m334	ALMSY	This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
L184392	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You bastard, I was believing you!
L184391	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
L184390	u5046	m334	ALMSY	It's a long song - Szerelem means love?and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
L184389	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	It's beautiful.  What's it about?
L184388	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
L184387	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Arabic?
L184386	u5046	m334	ALMSY	It's a folk song.
L184385	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	This is - what is this?
L184320	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
L184319	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	This is empty, just coming!
L184318	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I can still taste you.
L184315	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
L184314	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	No.
L184313	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
L184312	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What?  No!
L184311	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Say you're sick.
L184271	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
L184270	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	A lie.  What do you hate most?
L184269	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What do you hate most?
L184268	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
L184267	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What else?
L184266	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
L184265	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
L184264	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Now.
L184263	u5046	m334	ALMSY	When were you least happy?
L184262	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Now.
L184261	u5046	m334	ALMSY	When were you most happy?
L184260	u5046	m334	ALMSY	That makes it harder still.
L184259	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
L184258	u5046	m334	ALMSY	You don't sew at all!
L184257	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You sew very badly.
L184256	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Good.
L184255	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'm impressed you can sew.
L184253	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I believe you still have my book.
L184252	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Don't.
L184251	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
L184250	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Will you please come in?
L184249	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No.
L184248	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Will you not come in?
L184242	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No, but I think I do.
L184241	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Do they know them?
L184239	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
L184238	u5046	m334	ALMSY	And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
L184237	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
L184235	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
L184234	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
L184233	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
L184232	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
L184231	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Oh my God, the others!
L184230	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
L184228	u5046	m334	ALMSY	All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
L184227	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
L184226	u5046	m334	ALMSY	- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
L184224	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
L184223	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Yes.  Absolutely.
L184222	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
L184221	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No.
L184220	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	This is not very good, is it?
L184219	u5046	m334	ALMSY	In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
L184218	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
L184217	u5046	m334	ALMSY	See what's happening to them - the stars.
L184216	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What am I looking at?
L184215	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Look over there.
L184214	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'm quite all right, thank you.
L184213	u5046	m334	ALMSY	You should come into the shelter.
L184212	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
L184211	u5046	m334	ALMSY	There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
L184210	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'd like you to have them.
L184209	u5046	m334	ALMSY	We took several photographs, there's no need.
L184208	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I thought you might paste them into your book.
L184207	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What's this?
L184190	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
L184189	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I do not.
L184188	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You sing.  All the time.
L184187	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Pardon?
L184186	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Actually, you sing.
L184157	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Her or me?
L184156	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
L184155	u5046	m334	ALMSY	He said - be careful.
L184154	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
L184152	u5046	m334	ALMSY	The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
L184151	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
L184150	u5046	m334	ALMSY	A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
L184149	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What do you mean, poetry?
L184148	u5046	m334	ALMSY	This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
L184081	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
L184080	u5046	m334	ALMSY	As the wife of one of our party.
L184079	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	You felt obliged to.
L184078	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
L184077	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
L184076	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Excuse me?
L184075	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Why did you follow me yesterday?
L184056	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Excuse me.
L184055	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
L184054	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
L184053	u5046	m334	ALMSY	That insults them.
L184052	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I don't care to bargain.
L184051	u5046	m334	ALMSY	This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
L184050	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I don't want to go back.
L184049	u5046	m334	ALMSY	You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
L184048	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Excuse me?
L184047	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Which stall?
L184046	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
L184045	u5046	m334	ALMSY	They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
L184044	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Hello!  Good morning.
L184043	u5046	m334	ALMSY	How much did you pay?
L183961	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
L183960	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Daskylus?
L183957	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
L183956	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it?
L183950	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What kind of fossils?
L183949	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
L183918	u5046	m334	ALMSY	A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
L183917	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
L183916	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Thank you.
L184575	u5046	m334	ALMSY	And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials?  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
L184574	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Sorry, what's your point?
L184573	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
L184332	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I haven't, no.  Sorry.
L184331	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	It's Geoffrey under this.
L184330	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What?
L184329	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Have you seen Katharine?
L184182	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
L184181	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Very well.
L184180	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
L184179	u5046	m334	ALMSY	All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
L184178	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
L184177	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
L184176	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Appropriate?
L184175	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
L184174	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	You too.  Good luck!
L184173	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Safe journey.
L184168	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
L184167	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What kind of photographs?
L183924	u5046	m334	ALMSY	There you have me.
L183923	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
L183920	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Still a car.
L183919	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	A broken car?
L184734	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
L184733	u5059	m334	OFFICER	I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
L184732	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
L184731	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
L184730	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
L184729	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Right.  And what's your name, sir?
L184728	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
L184727	u5059	m334	OFFICER	If I could just see some identification.
L184726	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What?
L184725	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Do you have your papers, sir?
L184724	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and?  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
L184723	u5059	m334	OFFICER	I see.
L184722	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
L184721	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
L184720	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Could I trouble you for some water?
L184719	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Good morning!
L184663	u5046	m334	ALMSY	There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
L184662	u5057	m334	MADOX	May God make safety your companion.
L184661	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
L184660	u5057	m334	MADOX	I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
L184659	u5057	m334	MADOX	I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it?hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
L184658	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
L184657	u5057	m334	MADOX	When's Clifton picking you up?
L184656	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
L184655	u5057	m334	MADOX	We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
L184654	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I told you so.
L184653	u5057	m334	MADOX	Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but?  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
L184652	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Right.
L184651	u5057	m334	MADOX	Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still?
L184580	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
L184579	u5057	m334	MADOX	Look, either shut up, or go home.
L184570	u5057	m334	MADOX	Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
L184569	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I believe I'm rather late.
L184471	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Own the desert.
L184470	u5057	m334	MADOX	What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
L184469	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Why do they care about our maps?
L184468	u5057	m334	MADOX	Don't be so bloody na?ve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
L184467	u5046	m334	ALMSY	What's the matter with you?
L184466	u5057	m334	MADOX	Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
L184465	u5046	m334	ALMSY	In my room.
L184464	u5057	m334	MADOX	And where are the Expedition Maps?
L184462	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
L184461	u5057	m334	MADOX	Which we've overflown twice.
L184460	u5046	m334	ALMSY	No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility?
L184459	u5057	m334	MADOX	And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
L184201	u5057	m334	MADOX	Bermann!
L184200	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
L184199	u5057	m334	MADOX	I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
L183982	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
L183981	u5057	m334	MADOX	I was talking about the girl.
L183980	u5046	m334	ALMSY	I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
L183979	u5057	m334	MADOX	What did you do?
L183978	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Her hands and feet were tied.
L183977	u5057	m334	MADOX	You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
L183976	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
L183975	u5057	m334	MADOX	What did you think you were doing in his tent?
L184740	u5050	m334	CORPORAL	That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
L184739	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
L184738	u5050	m334	CORPORAL	Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
L184737	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
L184736	u5050	m334	CORPORAL	Shut-up!
L184735	u5046	m334	ALMSY	Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
L184006	u5047	m334	BOY	Thank you.
L184005	u5051	m334	HANA	Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
L184004	u5047	m334	BOY	Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
L184003	u5051	m334	HANA	No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
L184000	u5047	m334	BOY	You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
L183999	u5051	m334	HANA	Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
L183998	u5047	m334	BOY	Okay.
L183997	u5051	m334	HANA	How are you?
L184563	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
L184562	u5058	m334	MLLER	Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
L184555	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Don't cut me.  Come on.
L184554	u5058	m334	MLLER	Or was it Toronto?
L184553	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Don't cut me.
L184552	u5058	m334	MLLER	Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
L184550	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
L184549	u5058	m334	MLLER	Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
L184547	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
L184546	u5058	m334	MLLER	We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
L184545	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
L184541	u5058	m334	MLLER	You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
L184540	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
L184539	u5058	m334	MLLER	It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
L184538	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I don't know.
L184537	u5058	m334	MLLER	Is this you?
L184536	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
L184535	u5058	m334	MLLER	Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
L184534	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	No.
L184533	u5058	m334	MLLER	David Caravaggio.
L184808	u5051	m334	HANA	I can get in the back.
L184807	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	She can take you as far as Florence.
L184806	u5051	m334	HANA	Buon' giorno.
L184774	u5051	m334	HANA	What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
L184773	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Well, then ask him his name!
L184412	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
L184411	u5051	m334	HANA	I think that's called looting.
L184410	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I liberated it.
L184409	u5051	m334	HANA	Where did you find that?
L184308	u5051	m334	HANA	Please don't creep around this house.
L184307	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
L184306	u5051	m334	HANA	I don't know what that means.
L184305	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
L184304	u5051	m334	HANA	What?  How could he have?  When?
L184303	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	What if I told you he did this to me?
L184302	u5051	m334	HANA	Ask him.
L184301	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Who are his ghosts?
L184300	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
L184299	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
L184298	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
L184297	u5051	m334	HANA	Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
L184296	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
L184141	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
L184140	u5051	m334	HANA	What do you do?  What are you doing here?
L184139	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
L184138	u5051	m334	HANA	It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
L184137	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
L184136	u5051	m334	HANA	I could help you.  I could get you off that.
L184135	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Rabbit hunting.
L184134	u5051	m334	HANA	Where've you been?
L184133	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Supper. Hana calls after him.
L184035	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Fine.  I'm not looking.
L184034	u5051	m334	HANA	Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
L184033	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
L184032	u5051	m334	HANA	If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
L184031	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	No.
L184030	u5051	m334	HANA	So you can shoot a pistol?
L184029	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
L184028	u5051	m334	HANA	So was my Patient.
L184027	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Yeah, for a while.
L184026	u5051	m334	HANA	You were in Africa?
L184025	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in?have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
L184023	u5051	m334	HANA	Bonjour.
L184022	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
L184021	u5051	m334	HANA	What do you want?
L184020	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Are you Hana?
L184019	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
L184761	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	No, now I can't kill you.
L184760	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
L184759	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
L184758	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't? I couldn't even do that properly.
L184757	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
L184683	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
L184682	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
L184681	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Thousands of people did die, just different people.
L184680	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
L184679	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	The rest meant nothing to me.
L184678	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	What did you say?
L184677	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
L184676	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
L184675	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
L184674	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
L184673	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I see.
L184672	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
L184671	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Me?
L184670	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
L184669	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	We shall miss you.
L184668	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
L184667	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Hana tells me you're leaving.
L184634	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	What?
L184633	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
L184629	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Very true!
L184628	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
L184627	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I've had a drink.  Fatal.
L184626	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Have a drink.
L184416	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Is there a song you don't know?
L184415	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Top Hat.
L184414	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	For?
L184413	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Irving Berlin.
L184408	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
L184407	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Thought you'd never wake up!
L184353	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
L184352	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
L184351	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Moose.
L184350	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Is it you?  If I said Moose? I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
L184349	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
L184348	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
L184347	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
L184346	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
L184098	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
L184097	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
L184096	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	And you've forgotten yours.
L184095	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
L184094	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Are you planning to be the exception?
L184093	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
L184090	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
L184089	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Oh, all over.
L184088	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
L184087	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Thief, I think, is more accurate.
L184086	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
L184085	u5048	m334	CARAVAGGIO	Hello.
L184345	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
L184344	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	What?
L184343	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
L184342	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
L184341	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
L184340	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
L184339	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
L184338	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Aren't you?
L184337	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Right.
L184336	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
L184335	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Lady H said she thought you might be -
L184334	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I'm fine.  I got hot.
L184333	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
L184172	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
L184171	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Oh.
L184170	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft?
L184169	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Why do you think?  About my staying?
L184084	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Well, she is!
L184083	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Darling, for goodness' sake!
L184082	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
L184066	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Oh really?
L184065	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	The team is in mourning, darling.
L183969	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Off with his head!
L183968	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
L184164	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
L184163	u5057	m334	MADOX	Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
L184162	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	To arm-twisting.
L184161	u5057	m334	MADOX	And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
L184071	u5057	m334	MADOX	Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
L184070	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
L184062	u5057	m334	MADOX	I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
L184061	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Oh no, really.  She has her book.
L184060	u5057	m334	MADOX	Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
L183943	u5057	m334	MADOX	This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
L183942	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Apprentices.
L183941	u5057	m334	MADOX	I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
L183913	u5057	m334	MADOX	We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
L183912	u5049	m334	CLIFTON	Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
L183911	u5057	m334	MADOX	Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
L184632	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
L184631	u5051	m334	HANA	Never heard of it.
L184630	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
L184594	u5051	m334	HANA	Would you like me to?
L184593	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
L184490	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
L184489	u5051	m334	HANA	You'd better be.
L184488	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I'm still here.
L184453	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	- to her cooking.
L184452	u5051	m334	HANA	Hey! -
L184451	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
L184450	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I don't think it's indifference.
L184449	u5051	m334	HANA	I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
L184448	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
L184445	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
L184444	u5051	m334	HANA	Arguing about books.
L184420	u5051	m334	HANA	Kip's another one.
L184419	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I've been told that before.
L184418	u5051	m334	HANA	Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
L184372	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
L184371	u5051	m334	HANA	They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
L184370	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
L184369	u5051	m334	HANA	With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
L184368	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Why?  Is he staying?
L184367	u5051	m334	HANA	I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
L184366	u5051	m334	HANA	My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
L184365	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Really?  That's sudden.
L184364	u5051	m334	HANA	I'll probably marry him.
L184363	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
L184362	u5051	m334	HANA	He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
L184310	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	K is for Katharine.
L184309	u5051	m334	HANA	Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire?  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
L184273	u5051	m334	HANA	Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
L184272	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
L184146	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
L184145	u5051	m334	HANA	He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
L184144	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	That's a different dress.
L184143	u5051	m334	HANA	He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
L184142	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
L184124	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
L184123	u5051	m334	HANA	This is Captain McGann.
L184122	u5051	m334	HANA	Thank you.  Thank you.
L184121	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Well then - yes.  Of course.
L184120	u5051	m334	HANA	No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
L184119	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
L184118	u5051	m334	HANA	He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
L184117	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Your friend?
L184116	u5051	m334	HANA	Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
L184115	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Yes?
L184114	u5051	m334	HANA	Excuse me -
L184042	u5051	m334	HANA	He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
L184041	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
L184040	u5051	m334	HANA	He needn't disturb you.
L184039	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
L184038	u5051	m334	HANA	He's Canadian.
L184037	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Why?  Can he lay eggs?
L184036	u5051	m334	HANA	There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
L183995	u5051	m334	HANA	Because I'm a nurse.
L183994	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
L183993	u5051	m334	HANA	Are you crazy?
L183992	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Could I have a cigarette?
L183991	u5051	m334	HANA	Are you remembering more?
L183990	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I can see my wife in that view.
L183989	u5051	m334	HANA	No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
L183988	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
L183987	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm turning you.
L183986	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
L183985	u5051	m334	HANA	How?  How can you see anything?
L183984	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I can already see.
L183983	u5051	m334	HANA	I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
L183974	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Yes.  Dropping off.
L183973	u5051	m334	HANA	Are you asleep?
L183966	u5051	m334	HANA	When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure?
L183965	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
L183964	u5051	m334	HANA	Candaules?you're laughing at me.
L183963	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Candaules
L183962	u5051	m334	HANA	I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
L183931	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Thank you.
L183930	u5051	m334	HANA	Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
L183929	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
L183928	u5051	m334	HANA	I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
L183927	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
L183926	u5051	m334	HANA	I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
L183925	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
L183886	u5051	m334	HANA	Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
L183885	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
L184285	u5053	m334	JAN	Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
L183865	u5053	m334	JAN	I love you.
L183864	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm not sewing anything else for you!
L183863	u5053	m334	JAN	Hana, I know you do!
L183862	u5051	m334	HANA	No!
L183861	u5053	m334	JAN	You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
L183860	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm not sewing anything else.
L183859	u5053	m334	JAN	There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
L184791	u5051	m334	HANA	So one day we'll meet.
L184790	u5055	m334	KIP	I'll always go back to that church.
L184789	u5051	m334	HANA	I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
L184788	u5055	m334	KIP	Then come with me.
L184787	u5051	m334	HANA	I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
L184786	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
L184785	u5055	m334	KIP	It's what I've learned.
L184784	u5051	m334	HANA	Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
L184783	u5055	m334	KIP	I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
L184782	u5051	m334	HANA	Kip? I -
L184781	u5055	m334	KIP	I mean home.  India.
L184780	u5051	m334	HANA	Of course.  When?
L184779	u5055	m334	KIP	Will you come with me?
L184756	u5051	m334	HANA	Nya-nya-nya!
L184755	u5055	m334	KIP	This is hot!
L184754	u5055	m334	KIP	The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
L184753	u5051	m334	HANA	I should go to the house, get breakfast.
L184752	u5055	m334	KIP	When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
L184751	u5055	m334	KIP	That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
L184750	u5051	m334	HANA	What are you up to?
L184649	u5051	m334	HANA	You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
L184648	u5055	m334	KIP	Then I'd think there must be a reason.
L184647	u5051	m334	HANA	But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
L184646	u5055	m334	KIP	I try not to expect you.
L184645	u5051	m334	HANA	If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
L184644	u5051	m334	HANA	You loved him.
L184643	u5055	m334	KIP	I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once? He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
L184625	u5055	m334	KIP	Yes.  Later.
L184624	u5051	m334	HANA	Kip - come and dance with me
L184608	u5055	m334	KIP	This is what I do.  I do this every day.
L184607	u5051	m334	HANA	Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
L184515	u5055	m334	KIP	Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
L184514	u5051	m334	HANA	Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
L184513	u5055	m334	KIP	No. But he hands them over.
L184512	u5051	m334	HANA	Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
L184511	u5055	m334	KIP	You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
L184510	u5051	m334	HANA	I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
L184509	u5055	m334	KIP	Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
L184508	u5051	m334	HANA	I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
L184507	u5055	m334	KIP	What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
L184504	u5055	m334	KIP	I've done this.  I've had to do this.
L184503	u5051	m334	HANA	Why would anyone do this?
L184501	u5051	m334	HANA	I follow the wires.
L184500	u5055	m334	KIP	You get Hardy.
L184499	u5051	m334	HANA	So I follow the wires?
L184498	u5055	m334	KIP	There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
L184497	u5051	m334	HANA	What do I do?
L184496	u5055	m334	KIP	The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
L184495	u5051	m334	HANA	It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
L184447	u5051	m334	HANA	I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
L184446	u5055	m334	KIP	I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
L184434	u5051	m334	HANA	Yes, for your hair.
L184433	u5055	m334	KIP	For my hair?
L184432	u5055	m334	KIP	Thank you.
L184431	u5051	m334	HANA	Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
L184361	u5051	m334	HANA	I don't think so.
L184360	u5055	m334	KIP	I've met you before.
L184359	u5051	m334	HANA	No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
L184358	u5055	m334	KIP	Is something funny?
L184357	u5051	m334	HANA	I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
L184356	u5055	m334	KIP	The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
L184355	u5051	m334	HANA	Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
L184295	u5051	m334	HANA	Oh God.  Oh God.
L184294	u5060	m334	OLIVER	No.  He's - no.
L184293	u5051	m334	HANA	He's gone, hasn't he?
L184288	u5051	m334	HANA	Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
L184287	u5060	m334	OLIVER	Third Canadian Fusiliers.
L184284	u5060	m334	OLIVER	He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
L184283	u5051	m334	HANA	Why Picton?
L183882	u5060	m334	OLIVER	If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
L183881	u5051	m334	HANA	He can't even move.
L183880	u5060	m334	OLIVER	And what if he really is a spy?
L183879	u5051	m334	HANA	I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
L183878	u5060	m334	OLIVER	It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
L183877	u5051	m334	HANA	When he dies I'll catch up.
L183876	u5060	m334	OLIVER	It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
L183875	u5051	m334	HANA	The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
L184604	u5051	m334	HANA	What if you couldn't find him??  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
L184603	u5052	m334	HARDY	Pardon me?
L184602	u5051	m334	HANA	Does he have to go?
L184601	u5052	m334	HARDY	A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
L184600	u5051	m334	HANA	I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
L184599	u5052	m334	HARDY	Only we have to go to work.
L184598	u5051	m334	HANA	He's sleeping.
L184597	u5052	m334	HARDY	I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
L184428	u5052	m334	HARDY	A toddler
L184427	u5051	m334	HANA	You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
L184426	u5052	m334	HARDY	I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
L184425	u5051	m334	HANA	Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
L184424	u5052	m334	HARDY	Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
L184423	u5051	m334	HANA	I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever? you and Lieutenant Singh?
L184422	u5052	m334	HARDY	Hello miss.
L184421	u5051	m334	HANA	Hello.
L184132	u5061	m334	STUART	I'm feeling old.
L184131	u5051	m334	HANA	I thought that was for when we were very very old?
L184130	u5061	m334	STUART	I had a hotel room.
L184129	u5051	m334	HANA	I was looking forward to this evening.
L184128	u5061	m334	STUART	A bit of one.
L184127	u5051	m334	HANA	You've got a mustache.
L184018	u5061	m334	STUART	We can do that when we're very, very old.
L184017	u5051	m334	HANA	I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
L184016	u5061	m334	STUART	I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
L184015	u5051	m334	HANA	Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
L184014	u5061	m334	STUART	Whoa - give me a chance!
L184618	u5055	m334	KIP	This is making me incredibly angry.
L184617	u5052	m334	HARDY	Yessir.
L184616	u5055	m334	KIP	Go away.
L184615	u5052	m334	HARDY	You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
L184606	u5052	m334	HARDY	I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
L184605	u5055	m334	KIP	What's happening?  Am I needed?
L183867	u5052	m334	HARDY	Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
L183866	u5055	m334	KIP	Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
L184206	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
L184205	u5057	m334	MADOX	Certainly not.
L184166	u5057	m334	MADOX	Why not?
L184165	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Darling, Peter says I could stay?
L184069	u5057	m334	MADOX	A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
L184068	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	How awful.  What will you do?
L184067	u5057	m334	MADOX	I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
L184064	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
L184063	u5057	m334	MADOX	Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
L183959	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
L183958	u5057	m334	MADOX	Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
L184328	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
L184327	u5056	m334	LADY HAMPTON	I'll come with you.
L184326	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
L184325	u5056	m334	LADY HAMPTON	How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
L184324	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	I don't think so.
L184323	u5056	m334	LADY HAMPTON	You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
L184317	u5054	m334	KATHARINE	Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
L184316	u5056	m334	LADY HAMPTON	Katharine!
L184776	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
L184775	u5055	m334	KIP	They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
L184767	u5055	m334	KIP	What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
L184766	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	What are you talking about?
L184765	u5055	m334	KIP	I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
L184764	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Kip?
L184457	u5055	m334	KIP	What's he saying?
L184456	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	This is wonderful!
L184443	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
L184442	u5055	m334	KIP	What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
L184441	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
L184440	u5055	m334	KIP	It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
L184439	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
L184438	u5055	m334	KIP	Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
L184111	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
L184110	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Then you were married?
L184109	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Or my wife's.
L184108	u5059	m334	OFFICER	This was your garden?
L184107	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
L184106	u5059	m334	OFFICER	How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
L184105	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	No.
L184104	u5059	m334	OFFICER	Why?  Are you German?
L184103	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
L184100	u5062	m334	THE PATIENT	No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
L184099	u5059	m334	OFFICER	What about your rank or serial number?
L289047	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	A delegation.
L289046	u5909	m390	PAUL	We, who is we?
L289045	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
L288825	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
L288824	u5909	m390	PAUL	What happened?
L288440	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, it's a private function.
L288439	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
L288438	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
L288437	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, Paul, a moment please.
L288725	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll be back.
L288724	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
L288477	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288476	u5898	m390	BIK	Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
L288475	u5909	m390	PAUL	Leave it to me.
L288474	u5898	m390	BIK	The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
L288473	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me?
L288472	u5898	m390	BIK	That's what I came to talk to you about.
L288471	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
L288469	u5898	m390	BIK	Cockroaches?
L288468	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
L288419	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
L288418	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul!
L288729	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
L288728	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
L288718	u5909	m390	PAUL	I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
L288717	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
L288716	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
L288715	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Give me it.
L288714	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
L288713	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	And four children?
L288712	u5909	m390	PAUL	Ten.
L288701	u5909	m390	PAUL	Six.
L288700	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How many in your family?
L288699	u5909	m390	PAUL	Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
L288697	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have that much.
L288696	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Ten thousand francs for each one.
L288695	u5909	m390	PAUL	Name a price.
L288694	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How much?
L288693	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
L288692	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to pay me?
L288689	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	There is nothing to it.
L288688	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I don't use guns.
L288686	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let me explain.
L288685	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
L288671	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Where is your family?
L288670	u5909	m390	PAUL	Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
L288669	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288668	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
L288667	u5909	m390	PAUL	I used to work at the Diplomat.
L288666	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. I work at the Mille Collines.
L288665	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
L288664	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
L288663	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
L288662	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Let me see your identity card.
L288661	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about?
L288660	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	We are looking for you.
L288659	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
L288658	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Who are you?
L288801	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
L288800	u5903	m390	GLORIA	What was the response?
L288799	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes we have.
L288798	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Have you requested re-enforcements?
L288797	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
L288796	u5903	m390	GLORIA	If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
L288795	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
L288794	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
L288793	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
L288792	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
L289294	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
L289293	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
L289292	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
L289291	u5909	m390	PAUL	I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
L289290	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
L289280	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
L289279	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is it?
L289276	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I can't, I don't have the men.
L289275	u5909	m390	PAUL	Will you protect us.
L289274	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
L289273	u5909	m390	PAUL	I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
L289272	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
L289271	u5909	m390	PAUL	They fired a rocket at us.
L288886	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They're only taking the whites.
L288885	u5909	m390	PAUL	Their people?
L288884	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
L288883	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
L288882	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't understand.
L288881	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
L288880	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me, Colonel.
L288879	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
L288878	u5909	m390	PAUL	Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
L288877	u5909	m390	PAUL	Canadian Club?
L288876	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Anything. Strong.
L288830	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where is she?
L288829	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
L288828	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's happening?
L288827	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
L288804	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
L288803	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
L288802	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
L288782	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
L288781	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
L288780	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, you know who this is?
L289344	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will do nothing unless you help me now.
L289343	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You will tell them the truth.
L289342	u5909	m390	PAUL	You think they will believe you?
L289341	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I led no massacres.
L289340	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
L289339	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I committed no war crimes.
L289338	u5909	m390	PAUL	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
L289337	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You lie.
L289336	u5909	m390	PAUL	When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
L289335	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am on a list! What list?
L289334	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
L289333	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	How so.
L289332	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are a marked man.
L289331	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen, you need me.
L289330	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We are better here.
L289328	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
L289327	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
L289326	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
L289325	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
L289324	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
L289323	u5909	m390	PAUL	I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
L289322	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
L289321	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, sir.
L289320	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
L289319	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L289318	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You know what the Scottish call it?
L289313	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Today.
L289312	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289311	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
L289310	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean, General?
L289309	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
L289308	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are they going?
L289307	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
L289306	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your police are at the gate?
L289305	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Get in.
L289304	u5909	m390	PAUL	We must go to the Diplomat.
L289303	u5909	m390	PAUL	Bring back your policemen...
L289302	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I'll be over.
L289301	u5909	m390	PAUL	The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
L289300	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Whiskey?
L289299	u5909	m390	PAUL	General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
L289250	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
L289249	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
L289248	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
L289247	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Where are my supplies?
L289225	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
L289224	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You said you had no whiskey.
L289223	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
L289041	u5909	m390	PAUL	I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
L289040	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
L289039	u5909	m390	PAUL	I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
L289038	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I will see what I can do.
L289037	u5909	m390	PAUL	The front gate would be best, General.
L289036	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
L289035	u5909	m390	PAUL	?Well rewarded? Those were his words.
L289034	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	He did.
L289033	u5909	m390	PAUL	I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
L289032	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The police are very busy.
L289031	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
L289026	u5909	m390	PAUL	Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
L289025	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ?we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.? What do you think would have happened? No different.
L289024	u5909	m390	PAUL	'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
L289023	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The high command? Our high command?
L289022	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
L289021	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	And what will they do with these satellites?
L289020	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
L289019	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Satellites?
L289018	u5909	m390	PAUL	Satellites.
L289017	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Watch everything? How? They are gone.
L289016	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
L289015	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did they say?
L289014	u5909	m390	PAUL	A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
L289013	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did you overhear?
L289012	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
L289011	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
L289010	u5909	m390	PAUL	The United Nations are still here.
L289009	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
L289008	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
L288436	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
L288435	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
L288434	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
L289116	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Take the river road back. It is clear.
L289115	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's go.
L289113	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Why not? We are half way there already.
L289112	u5909	m390	PAUL	) You cannot kill them all.
L289111	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
L289110	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean George?
L289109	u5902	m390	GEORGE	No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
L289108	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have no whiskey?
L289107	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Beer yes, but no whiskey.
L289106	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
L289105	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
L288407	u5909	m390	PAUL	At least.
L288406	u5902	m390	GEORGE	A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
L288402	u5902	m390	GEORGE	I am always glad to see you Paul.
L288401	u5909	m390	PAUL	Very good.
L288400	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Business is good at the hotel?
L288399	u5909	m390	PAUL	Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
L288398	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Politics is power, Paul. And money.
L288397	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
L288914	u5903	m390	GLORIA	You?re drunk.
L288913	u5905	m390	JOCK	Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
L288912	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Let?s go, Jock.

L288851	u5905	m390	JOCK	You fucking see that!
L288850	u5903	m390	GLORIA	What is it?

L288808	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
L288807	u5905	m390	JOCK	Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
L288806	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We?re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
L288805	u5905	m390	JOCK	For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
L288847	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank God.
L288846	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Very soon.
L288845	u5909	m390	PAUL	When will they be here?
L288844	u5903	m390	GLORIA	The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
L288580	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288579	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Good. I'd like to book a massage.
L288578	u5909	m390	PAUL	The fifth room is your broadcast room.
L288559	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
L288558	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Great, I really need a shower.
L289118	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I saw the sign.
L289117	u5909	m390	PAUL	Are you sure this is the river road?
L289086	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just drive, Gregoire.
L289085	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	The fog is too heavy, sir.
L289084	u5909	m390	PAUL	For supplies, you drive.
L289083	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Where are we going, sir?
L289081	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
L289080	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Please, except my humblest apologies...
L289079	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
L288779	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
L288778	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
L288777	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
L288776	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get out of this room and get back to work.
L288773	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, what are you doing here?
L288772	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Mr. Manager.
L288566	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me the phone.
L288565	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	There are no more rooms.
L288911	u5905	m390	JOCK	Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
L288910	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
L288909	u5905	m390	JOCK	I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
L288908	u5909	m390	PAUL	I would never do that.
L288907	u5905	m390	JOCK	Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
L288841	u5909	m390	PAUL	This goes out live?
L288840	u5905	m390	JOCK	Perfect timing.
L288584	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
L288583	u5905	m390	JOCK	Can we phone them in, Paul?
L288582	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
L288581	u5905	m390	JOCK	Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
L288555	u5905	m390	JOCK	Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
L288554	u5909	m390	PAUL	Promoted. House Manager.
L288553	u5905	m390	JOCK	They moved you from the Diplomat?
L288552	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
L288551	u5905	m390	JOCK	Paul, how the hell are ya'?
L288975	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	I will remember that name.  Let's go.
L288974	u5909	m390	PAUL	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
L288973	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Don't lie to me. What's your name?
L288972	u5909	m390	PAUL	Call, sir?
L288971	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Who did you call?
L288969	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
L288968	u5909	m390	PAUL	That will take time.
L288967	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
L288966	u5909	m390	PAUL	The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
L288965	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
L288928	u5909	m390	PAUL	I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
L288927	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	It's an order. Get everyone out now.
L288926	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why sir?
L288925	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Everyone must leave the hotel now.
L288924	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, sir. What is wrong?
L288923	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You are the manager?
L289351	u5909	m390	PAUL	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
L289350	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
L289102	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	One thousand francs.
L289101	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much?
L289100	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
L289099	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have our cards.
L289098	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What cards?
L289097	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our cards, please.
L289096	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What?
L289095	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me.
L289094	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show me your ID
L289093	u5909	m390	PAUL	He will be here.
L289092	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	The commander is not here.
L289091	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
L289090	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What do you want?
L289172	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will give you my house.
L289171	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
L289170	u5909	m390	PAUL	How do you know?
L289169	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
L289168	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
L289167	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
L288863	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
L288862	u5909	m390	PAUL	Was there blood?
L288767	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	I will see what I can do.
L288766	u5909	m390	PAUL	This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
L288765	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
L288764	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
L288763	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need a great favor.
L288762	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
L289359	u5909	m390	PAUL	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
L289358	u5915	m390	XAVIER	They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
L289286	u5909	m390	PAUL	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
L289285	u5915	m390	XAVIER	This time the Militia will kill us.
L289003	u5909	m390	PAUL	Also, this is your bill for the last week.
L289002	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Pack the bags, we have to move.
L289001	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
L289000	u5915	m390	XAVIER	The third floor are low class rooms.
L288999	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm going to put you on the third floor.
L288998	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Move? Where to?
L288997	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid you will have to move room.
L288784	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288783	u5915	m390	XAVIER	I will need a suite.
L289371	u5909	m390	PAUL	Anais, it is so good to see you.
L289370	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my babies.
L289298	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go to the Diplomat.
L289297	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's wrong?
L289296	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
L289267	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
L289266	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please do not talk like this.
L289265	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
L289264	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of plan?
L289263	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to have a plan.
L289261	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are almost out of everything.
L289260	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We are almost out of water.
L289213	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Then another voice.
L289212	u5909	m390	PAUL	I love you. Keep the children safe.
L289211	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
L289210	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Let me go. Children get off.
L289208	u5909	m390	PAUL	I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
L289207	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No! Sit down now.
L289206	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to stay.
L289204	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No.
L289203	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get on the truck, Tatiana.
L289202	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
L289192	u5909	m390	PAUL	We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
L289191	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A little longer, Paul?
L289166	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
L289165	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, please try one more time.
L289164	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to get out of here Tatiana.
L289163	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not leave without the twins.
L289151	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A Volkswagen!
L289150	u5909	m390	PAUL	A Volkswagen.
L289149	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I want to know.
L289148	u5909	m390	PAUL	What does it matter.
L289147	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of car?
L289146	u5909	m390	PAUL	A car.
L289145	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Tell me what it was.
L289144	u5909	m390	PAUL	It was substantial.
L289143	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
L289142	u5909	m390	PAUL	To be closer. So that I could marry you.
L289141	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why?
L289140	u5909	m390	PAUL	I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
L289139	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What?
L289138	u5909	m390	PAUL	I had you transferred to Kigali.
L289137	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes.
L289136	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
L289135	u5914	m390	TATIANA	In Ruhengeri?
L289134	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have a confession. When we met...
L289132	u5909	m390	PAUL	A kiss.
L289131	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
L289130	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
L289129	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
L289078	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
L289077	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You cannot go alone.
L289076	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
L289075	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, no.
L289074	u5909	m390	PAUL	To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
L289073	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Go out! Where?
L289072	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go out to get food.
L289070	u5909	m390	PAUL	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
L289069	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's the matter?
L289068	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
L289067	u5914	m390	TATIANA	So where is the lamb?
L289066	u5909	m390	PAUL	Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
L288936	u5909	m390	PAUL	Do as I say. I will be there soon.
L288935	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What for Paul.
L288934	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go to the roof now.
L288922	u5909	m390	PAUL	Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
L288921	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
L288920	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you saying, Tatsi?
L288919	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could leave, Paul.
L288897	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
L288896	u5914	m390	TATIANA	But who is left?
L288895	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
L288893	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have been abandoned.
L288892	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What about us?
L288891	u5909	m390	PAUL	They are being evacuated.
L288870	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
L288869	u5914	m390	TATIANA	My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
L288866	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please go back, bring the children to us.
L288865	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
L288836	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give him time.
L288835	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
L288834	u5909	m390	PAUL	How can we help him.
L288833	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, Odette says he's in shock.
L288832	u5909	m390	PAUL	Has Roger spoken yet?
L288761	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try.
L288760	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
L288759	u5909	m390	PAUL	Any luck?
L288758	u5914	m390	TATIANA	It will do just fine.
L288757	u5909	m390	PAUL	This won't do.
L288746	u5909	m390	PAUL	Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
L288745	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
L288744	u5909	m390	PAUL	What!
L288743	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
L288742	u5909	m390	PAUL	Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
L288706	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get in.
L288705	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul, don't let them die.
L288655	u5909	m390	PAUL	Stay with the children.
L288654	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What is it, Paul.
L288640	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are you hurt, son?
L288639	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my God!
L288632	u5909	m390	PAUL	Dawn. Then they go.
L288631	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, 'til first light.
L288630	u5909	m390	PAUL	They know you are Tutsi!
L288629	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
L288628	u5909	m390	PAUL	Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
L288627	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
L288626	u5909	m390	PAUL	Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
L288623	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I tried already. The phones do not work.
L288622	u5909	m390	PAUL	I sent them home. Go and call them.
L288621	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Where are Thomas and Fedens?
L288618	u5909	m390	PAUL	Murdered! By whom?
L288617	u5914	m390	TATIANA	The president has been murdered.
L288614	u5909	m390	PAUL	Jean Baptiste!
L288613	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
L288547	u5909	m390	PAUL	"Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody."" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
L288546	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They do not have your connections.
L288545	u5909	m390	PAUL	He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
L288544	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
L288543	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
L288542	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could have asked for a favor.
L288541	u5909	m390	PAUL	I couldn't help.
L288540	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
L288536	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We must do something.
L288535	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L288533	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, be quiet.
L288532	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
L288531	u5909	m390	PAUL	What?
L288530	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Do something.
L288509	u5909	m390	PAUL	Homework?
L288508	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
L288492	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Of course.
L288491	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's have dinner first.
L288490	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He wants your wisdom.
L288489	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thomas wants advice?
L288483	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes, with Fedens and the children.
L288482	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your brother's here?
L288481	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
L288480	u5909	m390	PAUL	Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
L288983	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
L288982	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why?
L288981	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
L288980	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
L288979	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
L288818	u5909	m390	PAUL	There is one thing I need right away.
L288817	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
L288815	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
L288814	u5909	m390	PAUL	Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
L288813	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Can I have your name again?
L289236	u5916	m390	ZOZO	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
L289235	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about no water?
L289221	u5916	m390	ZOZO	As the trucks go.
L289220	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289219	u5916	m390	ZOZO	I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
L289189	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
L289188	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Thank you, sir.
L289187	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
L289030	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Many beers.
L289029	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much beer?
L289028	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
L289027	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where has all our beer gone?
L288962	u5916	m390	ZOZO	The lieutenant wants the register.
L288961	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you doing?
L288918	u5909	m390	PAUL	Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
L288917	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What do we do with all these people?
L288812	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
L288811	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
L288771	u5909	m390	PAUL	What! Paul storms off.
L288770	u5916	m390	ZOZO	He has taken the presidential suite.
L288769	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
L288423	u5909	m390	PAUL	How dead?
L288422	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Twelve are dead.
L288411	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
L288410	u5909	m390	PAUL	Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
L288389	u5909	m390	PAUL	Many times.
L288388	u5916	m390	ZOZO	You have taken business class?
L288387	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
L288386	u5916	m390	ZOZO	That is why they call it coach?
L288385	u5909	m390	PAUL	It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
L288384	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
L288383	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
L288382	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
L288381	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's wrong?
L288380	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Rutaganda's place?
L288960	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
L288959	u5909	m390	PAUL	The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
L288958	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
L288957	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
L288956	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, are you there?
L288953	u5909	m390	PAUL	Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
L288952	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	The staff and guests! How many?
L288951	u5909	m390	PAUL	The staff, the guests.
L288950	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	All. What do you mean all?
L288949	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
L288948	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Out? Where are you going?
L288947	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
L288946	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul. Are you alright?
L288527	u5912	m390	ROGER	On the street.
L288526	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where?
L288525	u5912	m390	ROGER	There are soldiers.
L288507	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who is this Simon?
L288506	u5912	m390	ROGER	Please, papa, I have a secret path.
L288505	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I don't want you going on the street.
L288504	u5912	m390	ROGER	Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
L288503	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why the hurry, Roger?
L288502	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, Roger.
L288501	u5912	m390	ROGER	For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
L288753	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go downstairs, I will help you.
L288752	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I don't know.
L288751	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is his room number?
L288750	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
L288749	u5909	m390	PAUL	Can I help you?
L288748	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	Moses, Moses Seradungu.
L339238	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
L339237	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I worry about them.
L339236	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Khambas are wild men.
L339235	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
L339234	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Kham, Holiness.
L339233	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where are you from?
L339232	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Yes, Holiness.
L339231	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All quiet?
L339226	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes. I am ready.
L339225	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Please, come, Holiness.
L339224	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A moment.
L339223	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	We must go, Holiness.
L338850	u6234	m417	BOY	I know.
L338849	u6253	m417	WOMAN	"And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. ""The Protector."""
L338847	u6234	m417	BOY	No cried?
L338846	u6253	m417	WOMAN	You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
L338841	u6234	m417	BOY	Cow.
L338840	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
L338839	u6234	m417	BOY	Tell me.
L338838	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Again?
L338837	u6234	m417	BOY	Mama, my story.
L339333	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No!
L339332	u6235	m417	FATHER	Goodbye, Kundun.
L339011	u6235	m417	FATHER	Hmmm.
L339010	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I free the prisoners?
L339009	u6235	m417	FATHER	I will buy them for you.
L339008	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Here. We'll collect them.
L339007	u6235	m417	FATHER	Where will you keep them?
L339006	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will you buy the sheep for me?
L339005	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
L339004	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have horses? You love horses.
L339003	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, now.
L338997	u6235	m417	FATHER	Are you? Of whom?
L338996	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I am in charge.
L338995	u6235	m417	FATHER	No.
L338994	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I do anything I want?
L338993	u6235	m417	FATHER	Not the way to talk to people.
L338990	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	It is alright, Father.
L338989	u6235	m417	FATHER	I am sorry, Lhamo.
L339359	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	And we will begin with tearing it down.
L339358	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
L339357	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	I will not approve it.
L339356	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
L339355	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
L339354	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
L339353	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
L339352	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
L339351	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
L339350	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
L339349	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
L339348	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
L339347	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
L339346	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Are you, General?
L339345	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
L339344	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
L339343	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
L339311	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
L339310	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soon.
L339309	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
L339306	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	I have a copy for you.
L339305	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have.
L339304	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
L339303	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Thank you. Please sit.
L339302	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
L339301	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	General Chiang.
L339300	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Dalai Lama.
L339317	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
L339316	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
L339299	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, we shall meet.
L339298	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
L339297	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes.
L339296	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Holiness?
L339295	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes, but they say he did.
L339294	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
L339285	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Time to study.
L339284	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes.
L339281	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He is a capable man.
L339280	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
L339279	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
L339278	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	I am afraid.
L339277	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	With much bloodshed.
L339276	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
L339275	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, we must face China and all her might alone.
L339271	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
L339270	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And the United Nations? Surely?
L339268	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All?
L339267	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
L339124	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	We did not.
L339123	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you receive the letter?
L339122	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	"The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the ""Chinese region of Tibet"". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."
L339121	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
L339116	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	It is calm.
L339115	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Sera monks have surrendered?
L339114	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
L338930	u6246	m417	MOTHER	We do not know.
L338929	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Who am I?
L338915	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
L338914	u6239	m417	LHAMO	This many?
L338913	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Two.
L338912	u6239	m417	LHAMO	How many?
L338911	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I will be back in a few days.
L338899	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I miss him too.
L338898	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I miss my brother.
L338897	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
L338896	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I pooped.
L338895	u6246	m417	MOTHER	At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
L338894	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Me. First break of day.
L338893	u6246	m417	MOTHER	"Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, ""His time has come."""
L338892	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Cow.
L338891	u6246	m417	MOTHER	He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
L338890	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Your father had been very sick.
L338863	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Far, far away.
L338862	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Oh, no. Where will he go?
L339049	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	Answer. 
L339048	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to squeeze this brain.
L339045	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
L339044	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
L339043	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
L339042	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What is suffering?
L339041	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
L339014	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	Not until you are eighteen.
L339013	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am him.
L339012	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
L339002	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you have money?
L339001	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	What do you think?
L339000	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do I have money?
L338999	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You could buy them.
L338998	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
L339431	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
L339430	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
L339424	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
L339423	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will not go.
L339422	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
L339411	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The people will not allow it.
L339410	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	They will take Lhasa next.
L339400	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
L339399	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
L339398	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
L339397	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
L339396	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
L339395	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
L339394	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
L339393	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
L339390	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I had relinquished doubt.
L339389	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Did you ever doubt it?
L339325	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
L339324	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
L339323	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am scared.
L339321	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
L339320	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
L339319	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
L339318	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
L339283	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
L339282	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
L339274	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Americas.
L339273	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is that?
L339272	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called ""El Salvador""."
L339169	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, ""The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming."" And then, the radio went dead."
L339168	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Has anyone died?
L339167	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
L339166	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the size of our army, now?
L339136	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
L339135	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Quite simple. Yes. Good.
L339134	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
L339133	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	America, we shall see.
L339132	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And, America?
L339131	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Britain chooses not to.
L339130	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Britain?
L339129	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
L339128	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can India help us?
L339127	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
L339126	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
L339125	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
L339120	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
L339119	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Ask whatever you will.
L339118	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
L339107	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
L339106	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What can I do? I am only a boy.
L339098	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Look here!
L339097	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
L339086	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	When it is time.
L339085	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339084	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	He warned about the future of Tibet.
L339083	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
L339078	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I do not know, Holiness.
L339077	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Alsace?
L339076	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is an island. American territory.
L339075	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Pacific Ocean.
L339065	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we ever be in war?
L339064	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. This war is almost over.
L339063	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we be in this war?
L339062	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
L339061	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. Not very big.
L339060	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that big?
L339059	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Roughly five thousand men.
L339058	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How big is Tibet's army?
L339057	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Please.
L339056	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
L338869	u6244	m417	MAN	Thank you.
L338868	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
L338867	u6244	m417	MAN	We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
L338866	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Please, come in, so cold.
L338865	u6244	m417	MAN	Good day.
L338864	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Good day.
L339384	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Always.
L339383	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
L339382	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
L339381	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
L339380	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I leave tomorrow.
L339379	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
L339376	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
L339375	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
L339374	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
L339373	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
L339372	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
L339371	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
L339370	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
L339369	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
L339427	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You decide.
L339426	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you think I must?
L339029	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
L339028	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will always!
L339027	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Me?
L339026	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But you will always be here?
L339025	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
L339024	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
L339023	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
L339022	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	"Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is ""lavish"" and ""willful"". ""How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"""
L339021	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
L339264	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
L339263	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	What does the butter spot feel like?
L339262	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You decide.
L339261	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	True.
L339260	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What do you think?
L339259	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Is that a true story, or pretend?
L339258	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
L339257	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Does he have the spot?
L339256	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
L339219	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
L339218	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You have grown up very good.
L339217	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We have.
L339216	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
L339215	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will miss you.
L339214	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
L339212	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
L339211	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Am I running away?
L339210	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	No, Holiness.
L339209	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will not come?
L339179	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
L339178	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I have no experience.
L339177	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
L339176	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
L339175	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people want you made Dalai Lama.
L339096	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
L339095	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
L339080	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339079	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Tibet. And this is China.
L339073	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Poland?
L339072	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339071	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Britain.
L339069	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
L339068	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Yes.
L339067	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Chinese.
L339066	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have enemies.
L338986	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I would not know. Maybe.
L338985	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
L338984	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
L338983	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
L338982	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You cannot.
L338981	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
L338980	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
L338979	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to go down there.
L338975	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	As you say.
L338974	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Pretend.
L338973	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	It is a story, you decide.
L338972	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that true or pretend?
L338971	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
L338955	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
L338954	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Things change, Kundun.
L338952	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I have smarter men.
L338951	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have more men.
L338950	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I am braver.
L338949	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
L338948	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
L339201	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	It may not be your decision to make.
L339200	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How could I ever leave?
L339199	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
L339198	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
L339197	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
L339196	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
L339195	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We cannot.
L339194	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
L339193	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
L339192	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	I do.
L339191	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
L339190	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
L339188	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Eliminate you.
L339187	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You, kill me?
L339186	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
L339185	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339155	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
L339154	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
L339153	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is a difficult situation.
L339152	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
L339151	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	What would you do, Holiness?
L339150	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
L339113	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
L339112	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Completely.
L339111	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You are unharmed?
L339110	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is possible, Holiness.
L339109	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
L339255	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I see that.
L339254	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Like my mother.
L339253	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
L339252	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Much too young.
L339251	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Too young?
L339250	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No.
L339248	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Does he treat you fairly?
L339247	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
L339246	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Hmm.
L339245	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
L339244	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you love your husband, before you married?
L342603	u6277	m420	ALICE	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
L342602	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
L342504	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Absolutely.
L342503	u6277	m420	ALICE	Can we rest soon?
L342502	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Are you alright?
L342492	u6277	m420	ALICE	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
L342491	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes, miss.
L342490	u6277	m420	ALICE	We leave in the morning?!
L342489	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	My God, you've grown up.
L342949	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
L342948	u6278	m420	CORA	Where will we go?
L342944	u6278	m420	CORA	I have nothing to go back for.
L342943	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Will you go back to England?
L342939	u6278	m420	CORA	Alice?
L342938	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	And my compliments to you...
L342897	u6278	m420	CORA	...never doubt what you are doing.
L342896	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
L342892	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. I want you to go.
L342891	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
L342884	u6278	m420	CORA	Our father? Did you see my father?
L342883	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Maybe...
L342882	u6278	m420	CORA	Are we safe?
L342782	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
L342781	u6278	m420	CORA	What is it?
L342778	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Do not.  Promise me.
L342777	u6278	m420	CORA	No. I will find you.
L342776	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
L342775	u6278	m420	CORA	What would you have me do?
L342774	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Because what I am interested in is right here...
L342773	u6278	m420	CORA	They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
L342683	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
L342682	u6278	m420	CORA	What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
L342680	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Miss.  May I?
L342679	u6278	m420	CORA	Mr Poe?
L342599	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
L342598	u6278	m420	CORA	Much further?
L342597	u6278	m420	CORA	On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
L342596	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Sorry to disappoint you...
L342595	u6278	m420	CORA	You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
L342593	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
L342592	u6278	m420	CORA	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
L342591	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
L342590	u6278	m420	CORA	And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
L342589	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
L342588	u6278	m420	CORA	How did you learn English?
L342587	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I do not remember them. I was one or two.
L342586	u6278	m420	CORA	I'm sorry.
L342585	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
L342583	u6278	m420	CORA	Thank you so much.
L342582	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
L342581	u6278	m420	CORA	We're a breed apart and we make no sense...?
L342580	u6278	m420	CORA	Why did they turn back?
L342579	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	The Ottawa are gone.
L342578	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"Yes. And ""do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."""
L342577	u6278	m420	CORA	What?!
L342576	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"Yes. He said... ""do not try to make them understand you."""
L342575	u6278	m420	CORA	He did?
L342574	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
L342573	u6278	m420	CORA	"Your ""father""?"
L342572	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Well that is to be expected. My father...
L342571	u6278	m420	CORA	You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
L342570	u6278	m420	CORA	You knew them.
L342569	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
L342568	u6278	m420	CORA	Why didn't you bury those people?
L342566	u6278	m420	CORA	I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
L342565	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Let us go, miss.
L342564	u6278	m420	CORA	Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
L342771	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
L342770	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You do not know what you are saying!
L342769	u6278	m420	CORA	"Justice?  If that's ""justice""..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people."
L342768	u6285	m420	MUNRO	But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
L342760	u6278	m420	CORA	He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
L342759	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
L342628	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I sent three men to Webb!
L342627	u6278	m420	CORA	There was no letter.
L342626	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What?
L342625	u6278	m420	CORA	There was none!
L342624	u6285	m420	MUNRO	My letter...
L342623	u6278	m420	CORA	When? How?
L342622	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
L342937	u6278	m420	CORA	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
L342936	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
L342890	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What the bloody hell plan is this?
L342889	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. Go ahead.
L342766	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
L342765	u6278	m420	CORA	"They do not live their lives ""by your leave.""  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way."
L342762	u6278	m420	CORA	You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
L342761	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
L342719	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
L342718	u6278	m420	CORA	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
L342710	u6278	m420	CORA	I am sorry, Duncan...
L342709	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I see...
L342707	u6278	m420	CORA	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
L342706	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
L342630	u6278	m420	CORA	He delivered no such message.
L342629	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	One called Magua arrived.
L342494	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	It can be dangerous...
L342493	u6278	m420	CORA	My God, Alice.
L342487	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. Yes, I will.
L342486	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Will you consider that?
L342485	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
L342484	u6278	m420	CORA	Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
L342483	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Some?
L342482	u6278	m420	CORA	Some say that's the way of it.
L342481	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
L342480	u6278	m420	CORA	Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
L342478	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"Aversion?  No... ""Hatred""... ""Loathing""..."
L342477	u6278	m420	CORA	You still have an aversion to the water?
L342476	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	And by sea!
L342475	u6278	m420	CORA	I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
L342881	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	: Only one or two loads.
L342880	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Any powder?
L342879	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
L342878	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	And if we're unlucky?
L342877	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
L342876	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then what?
L342875	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
L342874	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I don't understand!
L342873	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	We don't.
L342872	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Where do we go from here?
L342869	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
L342868	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Head for... for the white water.
L342865	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
L342864	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	How long?
L342735	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
L342734	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
L342733	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That is the truth!
L342732	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	That is sedition! Treason!
L342731	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
L342558	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Excuse me...
L342557	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Ottawa!
L342556	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Who were these people?
L342552	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Do not let gratitude get in the way...
L342551	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
L342548	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
L342547	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
L342546	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"I ain't your ""scout"". And I am in no damn militia."
L342545	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
L342544	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
L342543	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fort Edward, then?
L342542	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No.
L342541	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
L342540	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
L342539	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
L342538	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
L342537	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
L342536	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Dark haired...
L342535	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What?!
L342534	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
L342533	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
L342532	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
L342531	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	How far is it, scout?
L342527	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	...Fort William Henry.
L342526	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	We were headed...
L342525	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
L342438	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
L342437	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
L342436	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
L342433	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
L342432	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	Will you men help us stop the French?
L342431	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
L342430	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
L342429	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
L342428	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	What did you say?
L342427	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Your enemy...
L342426	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
L342749	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
L342748	u6281	m420	JACK	That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
L342747	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Got a reason to stay.
L342746	u6281	m420	JACK	You're not coming with us?
L342745	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
L342742	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
L342741	u6281	m420	JACK	I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
L342409	u6281	m420	JACK	We'll see in the morning...
L342408	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
L342407	u6281	m420	JACK	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
L342406	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
L342404	u6281	m420	JACK	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
L342403	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
L342928	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
L342927	u6283	m420	MAGUA	The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
L342926	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
L342925	u6283	m420	MAGUA	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
L342924	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
L342922	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
L342921	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
L342920	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
L342725	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You forget yourself!
L342724	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
L342723	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
L342717	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What did you see, Major?
L342716	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
L342657	u6285	m420	MUNRO	That's all, sir.
L342656	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Many men here, their homes are in the path.
L342654	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
L342653	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
L342647	u6285	m420	MUNRO	...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
L342646	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
L342637	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What else?
L342636	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
L342469	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	By your leave, sir.
L342468	u6288	m420	WEBB	The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
L342467	u6288	m420	WEBB	"Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The ""Scotsman"" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you."
L342466	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
L342465	u6288	m420	WEBB	You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
L342464	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
L342463	u6288	m420	WEBB	"I know.  One has to give Americans ""reasons"" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here."
L342462	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"The Crown ""negotiating"" the terms of service?"
L342461	u6288	m420	WEBB	And what is that?
L342460	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
L342811	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The decision is final.
L342810	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir!
L342809	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
L342808	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
L342807	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
L342796	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
L342795	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
L342764	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a ""by your leave."""
L342763	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
L342659	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
L342658	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Things were done. Nobody was spared...
L342651	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
L342650	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes, sir.
L342649	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Webb's at Edward?
L342648	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
L342645	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
L342644	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
L342643	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What a place for them...
L342635	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Thank you. How can I reward you?
L342634	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
L342633	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What happened to you?
L342632	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
L342631	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
L342846	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!
L342845	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Right - about face! March! First rank present!
L342843	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Yes sir!
L342842	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
L342701	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Atten-hut!
L342700	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
L342699	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!
L342698	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sergeant Major!
L342696	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!!!
L342695	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Shoulder arms!  Present! 
L342694	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
L342693	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Advance, Sergeant Major!
L342692	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!!!
L342691	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
L342690	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
L342689	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sergeant! Form three ranks!
L342913	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Heart. Give Magua new heart.
L342912	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What is enough?
L342910	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	The King? The King has mountains of gold!
L342909	u6283	m420	MAGUA	How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
L342908	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342907	u6283	m420	MAGUA	For Munro children?
L342906	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Gold could be arranged.
L342905	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
L342904	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342903	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
L342902	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342901	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Wampum?
L342900	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Three, four oxen... much wampum.
L342899	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Gifts?
L342898	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
L342511	u6283	m420	MAGUA	"Magua say: ""Yes. Good idea."""
L342510	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Excuse me. What did you say?
L342509	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness.
L342508	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
L342507	u6283	m420	MAGUA	I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
L342506	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
L342730	u6281	m420	JACK	Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
L342729	u6285	m420	MUNRO	This interview's over! The militia stays!
L342728	u6281	m420	JACK	Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
L342727	u6285	m420	MUNRO	British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
L342726	u6281	m420	JACK	We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
L342715	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
L342714	u6281	m420	JACK	Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
L342713	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
L342836	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
L342835	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
L342834	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
L342833	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My son Magua's pain is my pain.
L342832	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
L342831	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
L342830	u6283	m420	MAGUA	And this?
L342829	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
L342827	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
L342826	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
L342825	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
L342824	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
L342823	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
L342822	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
L342821	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Yes.
L342820	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
L342671	u6283	m420	MAGUA	When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
L342670	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
L342813	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Granted, Monsieur.
L342812	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
L342806	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Allow me to consult with my officers.
L342805	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Carry them to England to your King with pride.
L342804	u6285	m420	MUNRO	My colors?
L342803	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Granted.
L342802	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The honors of war?
L342801	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
L342800	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Their arms?
L342799	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
L342798	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Such as...?
L342791	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
L342790	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
L342789	u6285	m420	MUNRO	However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
L342788	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
L342787	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
L342786	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
L342785	u6285	m420	MUNRO	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
L342784	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
L342819	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
L342818	u6286	m420	SENTRY	C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
L342817	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	La victoire.
L342816	u6286	m420	SENTRY	Le mot d'ordre?
L342815	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	France.
L342814	u6286	m420	SENTRY	Qui vive?
L437782	u6996	m468	BILLY	He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
L437781	u6993	m468	ANTHONY	What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
L437778	u6993	m468	ANTHONY	If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
L437777	u6996	m468	BILLY	Are you sure they're here?
L437593	u6993	m468	ANTHONY	"No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, ""Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight.""  I've never known it to fail."
L437592	u6996	m468	BILLY	What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
L437591	u6993	m468	ANTHONY	That's your line for tonight, ya know.
L437590	u6996	m468	BILLY	You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
L437820	u6994	m468	BARBARA	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
L437819	u6995	m468	BETTY	I wish she could forget him.
L437786	u6994	m468	BARBARA	No, I was.
L437785	u6995	m468	BETTY	He was that good?
L437784	u6994	m468	BARBARA	Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
L437615	u6995	m468	BETTY	Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
L437614	u6994	m468	BARBARA	We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
L437611	u6995	m468	BETTY	Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
L437610	u6994	m468	BARBARA	You mean hiding them?
L437609	u6995	m468	BETTY	Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
L437645	u7011	m468	RED	Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
L437644	u6995	m468	BETTY	Nervous?
L437643	u7011	m468	RED	Only when I'm n-n-n-
L437642	u6995	m468	BETTY	Do you always stutter?
L437641	u7011	m468	RED	How would I know.
L437640	u6995	m468	BETTY	But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
L437639	u7011	m468	RED	You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
L437638	u6995	m468	BETTY	Red...Strange?
L437637	u7011	m468	RED	He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
L437679	u7010	m468	RAFE	Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
L437678	u6997	m468	BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
L437677	u7010	m468	RAFE	If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
L437676	u6997	m468	BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
L437675	u7010	m468	RAFE	That's me, Sir.
L437674	u6997	m468	BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
L437898	u7000	m468	DANNY	I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
L437897	u6998	m468	COLONEL	Too late for apologies, Walker.
L437896	u7000	m468	DANNY	Sir, I --
L437895	u6998	m468	COLONEL	You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
L437894	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hale-what?
L437893	u6998	m468	COLONEL	I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
L437892	u7000	m468	DANNY	Sir?
L437891	u6998	m468	COLONEL	Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
L437890	u7000	m468	DANNY	You liked that?
L437889	u6998	m468	COLONEL	That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
L437888	u7000	m468	DANNY	Yes Sir.
L437887	u6998	m468	COLONEL	You're Walker, right?
L437752	u6999	m468	COMA	You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
L437751	u7000	m468	DANNY	Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
L437735	u6999	m468	COMA	Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
L437734	u7000	m468	DANNY	Yeah.
L437727	u7000	m468	DANNY	What the hell happened to you guys?
L437726	u6999	m468	COMA	The one that slept in my mouth last night.
L437725	u7000	m468	DANNY	What lizard?
L437724	u6999	m468	COMA	Where's that lizard?
L437723	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
L437759	u6999	m468	COMA	Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
L437758	u7011	m468	RED	Well, you p-puked on his feet.
L437757	u6999	m468	COMA	Shit, he's puking on my feet!
L437733	u6999	m468	COMA	You guys are new?
L437732	u7011	m468	RED	I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
L437730	u6999	m468	COMA	No, like...
L437729	u7011	m468	RED	A m-missionary?
L437728	u6999	m468	COMA	Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
L438105	u7000	m468	DANNY	He did.
L438104	u7003	m468	EARL	Who the fuck taught you to fly?
L438066	u7000	m468	DANNY	Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
L438065	u7003	m468	EARL	Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
L438063	u7003	m468	EARL	Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
L438062	u7000	m468	DANNY	Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
L438059	u7000	m468	DANNY	You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
L438058	u7003	m468	EARL	Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
L438053	u7003	m468	EARL	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
L438052	u7000	m468	DANNY	They ready, Earl?
L438352	u7010	m468	RAFE	Yes you can.
L438351	u7000	m468	DANNY	I can't make it.
L438350	u7010	m468	RAFE	Danny...
L438295	u7010	m468	RAFE	Home of the Brave.
L438294	u7000	m468	DANNY	And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
L438293	u7010	m468	RAFE	We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
L438292	u7000	m468	DANNY	Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
L438280	u7000	m468	DANNY	Longer?  It's getting shorter.
L438279	u7010	m468	RAFE	It's not getting any longer.
L438268	u7000	m468	DANNY	"We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. ""Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork.""  It means ""Who the fuck thought up this shit?"""
L438267	u7010	m468	RAFE	They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
L438266	u7000	m468	DANNY	It's shorter than our practice runway.
L438232	u7010	m468	RAFE	What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
L438231	u7000	m468	DANNY	Maybe just trying to measure up.
L438230	u7010	m468	RAFE	Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
L438229	u7000	m468	DANNY	We've always tried to beat each other.
L438228	u7010	m468	RAFE	No.  You're trying to beat me.
L438227	u7000	m468	DANNY	What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
L438226	u7010	m468	RAFE	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
L438225	u7000	m468	DANNY	Fun today.  Like old times.
L438208	u7010	m468	RAFE	What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
L438207	u7000	m468	DANNY	Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
L438093	u7000	m468	DANNY	I'm out of fuel!
L438092	u7010	m468	RAFE	I'm out of ammo!
L438083	u7000	m468	DANNY	Home of the brave.
L438082	u7010	m468	RAFE	Land of the free.
L438080	u7000	m468	DANNY	Little less.
L438079	u7010	m468	RAFE	I got a half a tank.  You?
L438078	u7000	m468	DANNY	Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
L438077	u7010	m468	RAFE	You hear my okay?
L438074	u7010	m468	RAFE	Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
L438073	u7000	m468	DANNY	They're all over us!
L438071	u7010	m468	RAFE	Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
L438070	u7000	m468	DANNY	It's tight.
L438057	u7010	m468	RAFE	They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
L438056	u7000	m468	DANNY	This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
L438043	u7000	m468	DANNY	Six P-40's.
L438042	u7010	m468	RAFE	What's there?
L438041	u7000	m468	DANNY	Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
L438040	u7010	m468	RAFE	Where are we going?
L438035	u7000	m468	DANNY	Come on!
L438034	u7010	m468	RAFE	Get me into a plane!
L437987	u7010	m468	RAFE	How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
L437986	u7000	m468	DANNY	She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
L437984	u7000	m468	DANNY	She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
L437983	u7010	m468	RAFE	Fuck you.
L437982	u7000	m468	DANNY	Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
L437981	u7000	m468	DANNY	I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
L437980	u7010	m468	RAFE	How come you're not pukin'?
L437961	u7010	m468	RAFE	How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
L437960	u7000	m468	DANNY	You left her.  How's that for a fact?
L437959	u7010	m468	RAFE	I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
L437958	u7000	m468	DANNY	So what are you saying?
L437957	u7010	m468	RAFE	Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
L437956	u7000	m468	DANNY	I was grieving too.
L437955	u7010	m468	RAFE	I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
L437954	u7000	m468	DANNY	What facts are those?
L437953	u7010	m468	RAFE	We gotta face some facts here.
L437952	u7010	m468	RAFE	If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
L437951	u7000	m468	DANNY	You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
L437950	u7010	m468	RAFE	Waitress!  Four beers!
L437949	u7000	m468	DANNY	Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
L437948	u7010	m468	RAFE	I didn't mean it.
L437947	u7000	m468	DANNY	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
L437946	u7010	m468	RAFE	Sorry.
L437942	u7000	m468	DANNY	Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
L437941	u7010	m468	RAFE	Upset?  Why should I be upset?
L437940	u7000	m468	DANNY	You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
L437668	u7010	m468	RAFE	It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
L437667	u7000	m468	DANNY	Then why are you looking for her?
L437666	u7010	m468	RAFE	Yeah.
L437665	u7000	m468	DANNY	Didn't you say you told her not to come?
L437607	u7000	m468	DANNY	Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
L437606	u7010	m468	RAFE	I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
L437605	u7000	m468	DANNY	Nah, you go on.
L437602	u7010	m468	RAFE	Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
L437601	u7000	m468	DANNY	Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
L437600	u7010	m468	RAFE	I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
L437599	u7000	m468	DANNY	I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
L437598	u7010	m468	RAFE	The Colonel helped me work it out.
L437597	u7000	m468	DANNY	How could you do this?
L437554	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
L437553	u7010	m468	RAFE	Didn't you say test the limits?
L437535	u7010	m468	RAFE	There's another one!
L437534	u7000	m468	DANNY	Home of the brave!
L437533	u7010	m468	RAFE	Land of the free...
L437532	u7000	m468	DANNY	Good shooting, Rafe!
L437531	u7010	m468	RAFE	Good shooting, Danny!
L437530	u7000	m468	DANNY	Kill the bastards!
L437529	u7010	m468	RAFE	It's Germans!
L437528	u7000	m468	DANNY	Power dive!
L437527	u7010	m468	RAFE	Bandits at 2 o'clock.
L437741	u7008	m468	MECHANIC	We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
L437740	u7000	m468	DANNY	Yeah.
L437739	u7008	m468	MECHANIC	Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
L437738	u7000	m468	DANNY	What about easier to hit in an air raid?
L437737	u7008	m468	MECHANIC	The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
L437736	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
L437910	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hang on.
L437909	u7004	m468	EVELYN	So beautiful!
L437908	u7000	m468	DANNY	From the air?
L437907	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Well...sure.
L437906	u7000	m468	DANNY	Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
L437905	u7004	m468	EVELYN	He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
L437904	u7000	m468	DANNY	Sorry.
L437903	u7000	m468	DANNY	I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
L437902	u7004	m468	EVELYN	I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
L437901	u7000	m468	DANNY	That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
L437900	u7004	m468	EVELYN	We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
L437899	u7000	m468	DANNY	How's everything?
L437852	u7000	m468	DANNY	...He said that?
L437851	u7004	m468	EVELYN	He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
L437850	u7000	m468	DANNY	I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
L437849	u7004	m468	EVELYN	You were more like brothers.
L437848	u7000	m468	DANNY	Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
L437847	u7004	m468	EVELYN	He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
L437846	u7000	m468	DANNY	Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
L437845	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
L437844	u7000	m468	DANNY	Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
L438277	u7011	m468	RED	Y-Yes Sir.
L438276	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	No baseball diamonds, Red.
L438275	u7011	m468	RED	Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
L438274	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
L438273	u7011	m468	RED	I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
L438272	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
L438264	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	"I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  ""Lushu hoo megwa fugi.""  It means ""I am an American.""  In Chinese."
L438263	u7011	m468	RED	Then wh-where do we land?
L438262	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
L438261	u7011	m468	RED	C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
L438258	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
L438257	u7011	m468	RED	And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
L438284	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	I know.
L438283	u7010	m468	RAFE	Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
L438282	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
L438216	u7010	m468	RAFE	I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
L438215	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
L438211	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
L438210	u7010	m468	RAFE	Bombers.
L438209	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
L438201	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
L438200	u7010	m468	RAFE	Well sure, Colonel --
L438199	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
L438198	u7010	m468	RAFE	Is that the good new, Sir, or --
L438195	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Explain what?
L438194	u7010	m468	RAFE	We can explain, Colonel.
L438193	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	I heard what you did.
L437589	u7010	m468	RAFE	Thank you, Sir.
L437588	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
L437587	u7010	m468	RAFE	Thank you, Sir.
L437586	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
L437585	u7010	m468	RAFE	"Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a ""homage."""
L437584	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	Don't get smart with me, son.
L437583	u7010	m468	RAFE	How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
L437582	u7001	m468	DOOLITTLE	There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
L437842	u7002	m468	DORIE	You too, 'Mam.
L437841	u7004	m468	EVELYN	You take care, Dorie.
L437840	u7002	m468	DORIE	I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
L437839	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
L437838	u7002	m468	DORIE	Thank you, 'Mam.
L437836	u7002	m468	DORIE	Respect.
L437835	u7004	m468	EVELYN	What do you get for winning?
L437834	u7002	m468	DORIE	Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
L437833	u7004	m468	EVELYN	How often you fight like this?
L437832	u7004	m468	EVELYN	I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
L437831	u7002	m468	DORIE	Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
L437830	u7004	m468	EVELYN	What's your name?
L437829	u7002	m468	DORIE	Yes'm.
L437828	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Win?
L437827	u7002	m468	DORIE	Boxin'.
L437826	u7004	m468	EVELYN	How'd you get this?
L437825	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
L437824	u7002	m468	DORIE	Sorry to trouble you.
L437823	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Our doctor's gone too.
L437822	u7002	m468	DORIE	'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
L438251	u7004	m468	EVELYN	It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
L438250	u7010	m468	RAFE	It must of been a convincing letter.
L438249	u7004	m468	EVELYN	They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
L438248	u7010	m468	RAFE	What?...
L438183	u7004	m468	EVELYN	That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
L438182	u7010	m468	RAFE	Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
L438181	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
L438180	u7010	m468	RAFE	I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
L438179	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Rafe --
L438144	u7004	m468	EVELYN	There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
L438143	u7010	m468	RAFE	What else can we do?
L437933	u7004	m468	EVELYN	It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
L437932	u7010	m468	RAFE	Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
L437931	u7004	m468	EVELYN	It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
L437930	u7010	m468	RAFE	It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
L437928	u7010	m468	RAFE	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
L437927	u7004	m468	EVELYN	It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
L437926	u7010	m468	RAFE	Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
L437925	u7004	m468	EVELYN	I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
L437924	u7010	m468	RAFE	I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
L437922	u7010	m468	RAFE	...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
L437921	u7004	m468	EVELYN	How did you?...
L437920	u7010	m468	RAFE	I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
L437919	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Why were you sitting here, instead of...
L437918	u7010	m468	RAFE	I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
L437663	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Do one thing for me, before you go.
L437662	u7010	m468	RAFE	Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
L437661	u7004	m468	EVELYN	I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
L437660	u7010	m468	RAFE	Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
L437659	u7010	m468	RAFE	I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
L437658	u7004	m468	EVELYN	You waited til tonight to tell me?
L437657	u7010	m468	RAFE	Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
L437656	u7004	m468	EVELYN	But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
L437655	u7010	m468	RAFE	I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
L437654	u7004	m468	EVELYN	We're all going away.
L437653	u7010	m468	RAFE	There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
L437652	u7004	m468	EVELYN	It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
L437651	u7010	m468	RAFE	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
L437650	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
L437632	u7004	m468	EVELYN	I was hoping to meet him.
L437631	u7010	m468	RAFE	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
L437630	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Danny's not coming?
L437628	u7010	m468	RAFE	Nice to meet you, Betty.
L437627	u7004	m468	EVELYN	Oh, this is Betty.
L437626	u7004	m468	EVELYN	You too, Lieutenant.
L437625	u7010	m468	RAFE	Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
L438133	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
L438132	u7005	m468	GENDA	If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
L438127	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
L438126	u7005	m468	GENDA	We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
L438008	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
L438007	u7005	m468	GENDA	We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
L438006	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
L437859	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
L437858	u7005	m468	GENDA	Brilliant, Admiral.
L437857	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
L437856	u7005	m468	GENDA	If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
L437855	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
L437775	u7005	m468	GENDA	I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
L437774	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
L438330	u7012	m468	ROOSEVELT	God help them.
L438329	u7006	m468	GENERAL MARSHALL	The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
L438328	u7012	m468	ROOSEVELT	So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
L438327	u7006	m468	GENERAL MARSHALL	There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
L438326	u7012	m468	ROOSEVELT	Have the planes made it to China?
L438325	u7006	m468	GENERAL MARSHALL	We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
L438174	u7006	m468	GENERAL MARSHALL	We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
L438173	u7012	m468	ROOSEVELT	What if the Japanese did invade?
L437803	u7010	m468	RAFE	Crank her!
L437802	u7007	m468	IAN	I have'na been able ta --
L437800	u7007	m468	IAN	Fook ya dooble!
L437799	u7010	m468	RAFE	Learn English, then!
L437798	u7007	m468	IAN	Fook ya!
L437797	u7010	m468	RAFE	And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
L437796	u7007	m468	IAN	If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
L437795	u7010	m468	RAFE	All of 'em.
L437794	u7007	m468	IAN	Well which of those three ya want fixed?
L437793	u7010	m468	RAFE	The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
L437792	u7007	m468	IAN	Leapin' Jesus!
L437717	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
L437716	u7009	m468	NISHIKURA	You see us as capable of such a blow?
L437715	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
L437714	u7009	m468	NISHIKURA	You have something to say, Yamamoto?
L437712	u7009	m468	NISHIKURA	The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
L437711	u7013	m468	YAMAMOTO	If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
L437710	u7009	m468	NISHIKURA	So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
L446133	u7078	m474	CHRIS	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
L446132	u7075	m474	BARNES	I SHIT on all o' you.
L446101	u7075	m474	BARNES	Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.

L445864	u7078	m474	CHRIS	Where?
L445863	u7075	m474	BARNES	Bunker...
L446058	u7075	m474	BARNES	Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
L446057	u7080	m474	ELIAS	...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
L446053	u7080	m474	ELIAS	Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
L446052	u7075	m474	BARNES	Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
L445935	u7080	m474	ELIAS	YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
L445934	u7075	m474	BARNES	You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
L445932	u7080	m474	ELIAS	YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
L445931	u7075	m474	BARNES	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
L445930	u7080	m474	ELIAS	WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
L445694	u7080	m474	ELIAS	Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
L445693	u7075	m474	BARNES	How the hell did he get away?
L445692	u7080	m474	ELIAS	Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
L445629	u7080	m474	ELIAS	I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
L445628	u7075	m474	BARNES	Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
L446194	u7075	m474	BARNES	...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
L446193	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
L446192	u7075	m474	BARNES	I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
L446191	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
L446190	u7075	m474	BARNES	I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...

L446187	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
L446183	u7075	m474	BARNES	Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.

L446178	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Says he can't walk.
L446177	u7075	m474	BARNES	So what's the problem?
L445624	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
L445623	u7075	m474	BARNES	We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.

L446167	u7078	m474	CHRIS	Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
L446166	u7083	m474	KING	Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?

L445729	u7083	m474	KING	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
L445728	u7079	m474	CRAWFORD	You volunteered for this shit man?

L445718	u7079	m474	CRAWFORD	Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...

L445633	u7080	m474	ELIAS	Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
L445632	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
L445631	u7080	m474	ELIAS	They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
L445630	u7085	m474	O'NEILL	Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.

L446054	u7087	m474	WOLFE	Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
L445941	u7087	m474	WOLFE	No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

L445872	u7087	m474	WOLFE	They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
L445871	u7080	m474	ELIAS	Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
L446124	u7086	m474	RHAH	I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
L446123	u7083	m474	KING	Right on.

L445996	u7086	m474	RHAH	Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man.

L445981	u7084	m474	LERNER	Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.

L445971	u7084	m474	LERNER	Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
L445762	u7086	m474	RHAH	Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.

L446153	u7086	m474	RHAH	Right...
L446152	u7087	m474	WOLFE	That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
L446151	u7086	m474	RHAH	You don't want to hear about it?
L446150	u7087	m474	WOLFE	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
L446149	u7086	m474	RHAH	Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
L446148	u7087	m474	WOLFE	I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
L446147	u7086	m474	RHAH	Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
L446146	u7087	m474	WOLFE	These two holes are yours...
L446145	u7086	m474	RHAH	Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
L446144	u7087	m474	WOLFE	Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
L446143	u7086	m474	RHAH	You wanted to see me sir?
L482833	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thank you, sir.
L482832	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Good luck, John.
L482828	u7423	m502	MILLER	The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
L482827	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
L482824	u7423	m502	MILLER	Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
L482823	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Spit it out, Captain.
L482822	u7423	m502	MILLER	But, sir...I...I...
L482821	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
L482820	u7423	m502	MILLER	A private, sir?
L482819	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
L482818	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sir?
L482817	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
L482816	u7423	m502	MILLER	Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
L482815	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Where are your men now?
L482814	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yes, sir.
L482813	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
L482812	u7423	m502	MILLER	They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
L482811	u7423	m502	MILLER	Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
L482810	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Casualties?
L482809	u7423	m502	MILLER	A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
L482808	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Resistance?
L482807	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
L482806	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Report.
L482804	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	...alright, let me know when.
L482803	u7423	m502	MILLER	Find a chaplain.
L483081	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Shit, that was no big deal.
L483080	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
L483064	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You take account of the wind?
L483063	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
L483062	u7428	m502	UPHAM	That must be four thousand yards.
L483061	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Not where I come from.
L483060	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You must be a hell a shot.
L483059	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yep.
L483058	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The Army gave you that?
L483057	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
L482992	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
L482991	u7422	m502	JACKSON	We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
L482990	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So they travel around from place to place and preach?
L482989	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
L482988	u7428	m502	UPHAM	No kidding.
L482987	u7422	m502	JACKSON	In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
L482986	u7428	m502	UPHAM	In West Fork?
L482985	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
L482981	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Figured.
L482980	u7428	m502	UPHAM	As a matter of fact, I am.
L482979	u7422	m502	JACKSON	You writin' a book or somethin'?
L482978	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So, where are you from?
L483541	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
L483540	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
L483539	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
L483533	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What deal?
L483532	u7422	m502	JACKSON	No kiddin'?
L483527	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Like hell, you did.
L483526	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
L483471	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Nope, he ain't Wade.
L483470	u7422	m502	JACKSON	He ain't Wade.
L483469	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I guess.
L483468	u7422	m502	JACKSON	He ain't half-bad, I guess.
L483467	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
L483466	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
L483465	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What do you think?
L483440	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hell, no!
L483439	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
L483438	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Y'all come back.
L483393	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Of course, sir.
L483392	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yes, sir.
L483384	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Cap'n...?
L483383	u7424	m502	REIBEN	He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
L483360	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
L483359	u7422	m502	JACKSON	So, that's Ryan.
L483310	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
L483309	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
L483262	u7424	m502	REIBEN	The hell he didn't.
L483261	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
L483260	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
L483259	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Shut up, will you?
L483258	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
L483099	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
L483098	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Last I knew.
L483067	u7424	m502	REIBEN	They got squirrels there, too, right?
L483066	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
L483012	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
L483011	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
L483010	u7424	m502	REIBEN	If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
L483005	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
L483004	u7422	m502	JACKSON	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
L483003	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
L482903	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
L482902	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jackson?
L483549	u7422	m502	JACKSON	To each, his own.
L483548	u7423	m502	MILLER	It's worth it.
L483547	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
L483546	u7423	m502	MILLER	You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
L483545	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Say what, Cap'n?
L483544	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
L483356	u7423	m502	MILLER	Keep trying.
L483355	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Not yet.
L483308	u7423	m502	MILLER	Good, now get your goddamned gear.
L483307	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
L483306	u7423	m502	MILLER	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
L483305	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
L483303	u7423	m502	MILLER	Who's Wade?
L483302	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
L483301	u7423	m502	MILLER	What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
L483252	u7423	m502	MILLER	Gives Wade the second shot.
L483251	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Watching.
L483191	u7423	m502	MILLER	They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
L483190	u7422	m502	JACKSON	We left them eighty-eights.
L483185	u7423	m502	MILLER	My guess, too.
L483184	u7422	m502	JACKSON	In the shadow by those two trees.
L483183	u7423	m502	MILLER	Where?
L483108	u7423	m502	MILLER	Wade?
L483107	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
L483106	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
L483104	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
L483103	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'd love to hear it.
L483102	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
L483009	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
L483008	u7423	m502	MILLER	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
L483007	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
L482874	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
L482873	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Senator's son?
L482872	u7423	m502	MILLER	A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
L482869	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
L482868	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about that jeep?
L482867	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
L482866	u7423	m502	MILLER	A half-track, anything.
L482865	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
L482864	u7423	m502	MILLER	White-walls?
L482863	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
L483529	u7423	m502	MILLER	I changed my mind.
L483528	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Captain, what about our deal?
L483525	u7423	m502	MILLER	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
L483524	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What'd you say, Captain?
L483428	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
L483427	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Goddamn it, sir...
L483426	u7423	m502	MILLER	There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
L483425	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But, sir...
L483424	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
L483420	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The Germans do.
L483419	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, you got one?
L483418	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Would they notice and eighty-eight?
L483417	u7423	m502	MILLER	Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
L483416	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What about our grenades?
L483408	u7423	m502	MILLER	Those guns are close.
L483407	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
L483387	u7423	m502	MILLER	You don't count.
L483386	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
L483332	u7423	m502	MILLER	Same place we are.
L483331	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I wonder where they're going.
L483213	u7423	m502	MILLER	Plenty.
L483212	u7428	m502	UPHAM	That only leaves three.
L483211	u7423	m502	MILLER	What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
L483210	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The men said, nine.
L483209	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
L483208	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Good luck, Captain.
L483187	u7423	m502	MILLER	A machine gun.
L483186	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What is it?
L483181	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
L483180	u7428	m502	UPHAM	No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
L483179	u7423	m502	MILLER	Did he see any sign of them?
L483178	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
L483175	u7423	m502	MILLER	I don't expect to live that long.
L483174	u7428	m502	UPHAM	If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
L483173	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
L483172	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Over three-hundred.
L483170	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Where are you from, Captain?
L483169	u7423	m502	MILLER	Some.
L483168	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You know classical music?
L483167	u7423	m502	MILLER	It seemed appropriate.
L483166	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I heard.
L483165	u7423	m502	MILLER	I've been humming it.
L483164	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
L483163	u7423	m502	MILLER	It looks like a Renoir.
L483151	u7423	m502	MILLER	You think the rest of us were?
L483150	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I wasn't made for this.
L483113	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge?
L483112	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Pass.
L483111	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham?
L483079	u7423	m502	MILLER	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
L483078	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But you could have gotten killed and I...
L483077	u7423	m502	MILLER	It was nothing.
L483076	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
L483045	u7423	m502	MILLER	DASHES across the street.
L483044	u7428	m502	UPHAM	On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
L483043	u7423	m502	MILLER	Glad of it.
L482968	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
L482967	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
L482943	u7423	m502	MILLER	FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
L482942	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
L483435	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yes, sir.
L483434	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
L483423	u7423	m502	MILLER	Out of the mouth of babes.
L483422	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, oh.
L483413	u7423	m502	MILLER	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
L483412	u7426	m502	SARGE	What are we going to do?
L483411	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
L483410	u7426	m502	SARGE	What do you think?
L483405	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yes, sir.
L483404	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
L483296	u7423	m502	MILLER	But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
L483295	u7426	m502	SARGE	You're welcome, John.
L483294	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
L483292	u7426	m502	SARGE	I'll do my best.
L483291	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
L483290	u7426	m502	SARGE	I know.
L483289	u7423	m502	MILLER	You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
L483288	u7426	m502	SARGE	Just what I want to do.
L483287	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
L483286	u7426	m502	SARGE	You want me to take over?
L483285	u7423	m502	MILLER	I think you're right, Keith.
L483284	u7426	m502	SARGE	John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
L483283	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
L483282	u7426	m502	SARGE	Except this time, the mission IS a man.
L483281	u7423	m502	MILLER	Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
L483280	u7426	m502	SARGE	And how do you bluff yourself?
L483279	u7423	m502	MILLER	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
L483278	u7426	m502	SARGE	Oh, yeah?
L483277	u7423	m502	MILLER	It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
L483276	u7423	m502	MILLER	No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
L483275	u7426	m502	SARGE	And what about your own hand?
L483274	u7423	m502	MILLER	She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
L483273	u7426	m502	SARGE	Bits and pieces.
L483272	u7423	m502	MILLER	You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
L483271	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yeah.
L483270	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
L483269	u7426	m502	SARGE	Vecchio.
L483268	u7423	m502	MILLER	What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
L483266	u7423	m502	MILLER	Let's just find someplace.
L483265	u7426	m502	SARGE	You alright?
L483247	u7423	m502	MILLER	Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
L483246	u7426	m502	SARGE	Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
L483245	u7423	m502	MILLER	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
L483244	u7423	m502	MILLER	SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
L483238	u7423	m502	MILLER	About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
L483237	u7426	m502	SARGE	Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
L483231	u7423	m502	MILLER	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
L483230	u7426	m502	SARGE	HOLD YOUR FIRE!
L483206	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about you shut up and take your position?
L483205	u7426	m502	SARGE	How about...?
L483204	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about you take your position?
L483203	u7426	m502	SARGE	How about I go right, sir?
L483202	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
L483161	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll be alright.
L483160	u7426	m502	SARGE	You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
L483159	u7423	m502	MILLER	No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
L483158	u7426	m502	SARGE	Is it getting worse?
L483157	u7423	m502	MILLER	A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
L483149	u7423	m502	MILLER	It doesn't take this.
L483148	u7426	m502	SARGE	Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
L483146	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yup, hell of a mission.
L483145	u7423	m502	MILLER	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
L483144	u7426	m502	SARGE	I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
L483143	u7423	m502	MILLER	You never know.
L483142	u7426	m502	SARGE	You're kidding yourself.
L483141	u7423	m502	MILLER	If we stayed, we could make a difference.
L483140	u7426	m502	SARGE	Three for three.
L483139	u7423	m502	MILLER	Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
L483138	u7426	m502	SARGE	Nope.
L483137	u7423	m502	MILLER	They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
L483136	u7426	m502	SARGE	And what about you?
L483135	u7423	m502	MILLER	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
L483134	u7426	m502	SARGE	You think they'll be alright?
L483133	u7426	m502	SARGE	Good news?
L483132	u7423	m502	MILLER	Nope.
L483131	u7426	m502	SARGE	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
L483130	u7423	m502	MILLER	Since when have things been normal?
L483129	u7426	m502	SARGE	It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
L483128	u7423	m502	MILLER	Maybe.
L483127	u7426	m502	SARGE	You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
L482975	u7423	m502	MILLER	Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
L482974	u7426	m502	SARGE	He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
L482971	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's not what we're here for.
L482970	u7426	m502	SARGE	Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
L482946	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, Captain...
L482945	u7423	m502	MILLER	PUSH!
L482944	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, Captain...
L482900	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yep, hell of a mission.
L482899	u7426	m502	SARGE	Hell of a mission.
L482898	u7423	m502	MILLER	A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
L482895	u7423	m502	MILLER	Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
L482894	u7426	m502	SARGE	We in radio contact with anybody up there?
L482893	u7423	m502	MILLER	Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
L482860	u7423	m502	MILLER	I've got a line on one.
L482859	u7426	m502	SARGE	You get a translator, Captain?
L482849	u7426	m502	SARGE	Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
L482848	u7423	m502	MILLER	What about Talbot?
L482847	u7426	m502	SARGE	Fresh out.
L482846	u7423	m502	MILLER	Okay, Wade.  Translators?
L482845	u7426	m502	SARGE	Beasley's dead.
L482844	u7423	m502	MILLER	I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
L482843	u7426	m502	SARGE	Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
L482842	u7423	m502	MILLER	Simpson.
L482841	u7426	m502	SARGE	What about the company?
L482840	u7423	m502	MILLER	Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
L482839	u7426	m502	SARGE	You?  Leading a squad?
L482838	u7423	m502	MILLER	I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
L482837	u7426	m502	SARGE	Caen?
L482761	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
L482760	u7426	m502	SARGE	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
L482759	u7423	m502	MILLER	Worked, didn't it?
L482753	u7423	m502	MILLER	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
L482752	u7426	m502	SARGE	CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
L482748	u7426	m502	SARGE	Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
L482747	u7423	m502	MILLER	GO!
L483587	u7424	m502	REIBEN	More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
L483586	u7423	m502	MILLER	Goddamn it!
L483567	u7423	m502	MILLER	Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
L483566	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
L483555	u7423	m502	MILLER	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
L483554	u7424	m502	REIBEN	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
L483553	u7423	m502	MILLER	Here they come.
L483552	u7423	m502	MILLER	Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
L483537	u7424	m502	REIBEN	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
L483536	u7423	m502	MILLER	I wonder if his cabin is still available?
L483531	u7423	m502	MILLER	I coach the baseball team, too.
L483530	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What deal?
L483517	u7423	m502	MILLER	Get back to your positions!
L483516	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483483	u7424	m502	REIBEN	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
L483482	u7423	m502	MILLER	HERE THEY COME!
L483481	u7423	m502	MILLER	Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
L483430	u7423	m502	MILLER	See to it.
L483429	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
L483415	u7423	m502	MILLER	Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
L483414	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Maybe Caen.
L483391	u7423	m502	MILLER	You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
L483390	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
L483346	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Have it your way, Captain.
L483345	u7423	m502	MILLER	You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
L483344	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What if our guys open up, sir?
L483343	u7423	m502	MILLER	I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
L483339	u7423	m502	MILLER	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
L483338	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
L483334	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
L483333	u7423	m502	MILLER	Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
L483322	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's a mystery to me.
L483321	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No, sir.
L483320	u7423	m502	MILLER	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
L483319	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
L483318	u7423	m502	MILLER	But we accomplish the mission.
L483317	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
L483316	u7423	m502	MILLER	I don't like that one.
L483315	u7424	m502	REIBEN	B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
L483314	u7423	m502	MILLER	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
L483313	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
L483312	u7423	m502	MILLER	Why's that?
L483311	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
L483300	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
L483299	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
L483298	u7423	m502	MILLER	Up.  We're moving out.
L483255	u7423	m502	MILLER	Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
L483254	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483189	u7423	m502	MILLER	We can't leave it here.
L483188	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
L483125	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
L483124	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
L483123	u7423	m502	MILLER	Any further thoughts on the subject?
L483121	u7423	m502	MILLER	But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
L483120	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
L483119	u7423	m502	MILLER	In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
L483117	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
L483116	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
L483101	u7423	m502	MILLER	You have orders, too.
L483100	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
L483095	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
L483094	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
L483093	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
L483092	u7423	m502	MILLER	Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
L483091	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Huh?
L483090	u7423	m502	MILLER	Ours is not to reason why.
L483089	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
L483088	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, what do you want to know?
L483087	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
L483029	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
L483028	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
L482961	u7423	m502	MILLER	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
L482960	u7424	m502	REIBEN	General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
L482913	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well, I, for one, like cheese.
L482912	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'm listening, sir.
L482911	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's always a bright side.
L482910	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
L482909	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's to be a bright side, look for it.
L482908	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
L482907	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, how so?
L482906	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
L482890	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
L482889	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, Reiben.
L482888	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, can I ask you a question?
L482858	u7424	m502	REIBEN	But, sir...
L482857	u7423	m502	MILLER	Trust me, you're the best.
L482856	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
L482855	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
L482854	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
L482853	u7423	m502	MILLER	Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
L482797	u7423	m502	MILLER	Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
L482796	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I don't think so, Captain.
L482793	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
L482792	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
L482791	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
L482790	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
L482789	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
L482788	u7424	m502	REIBEN	So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
L482782	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
L482781	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
L482745	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
L482744	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
L483603	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
L483602	u7425	m502	RYAN	And Sarge?
L483601	u7423	m502	MILLER	Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
L483598	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yeah?
L483597	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
L483596	u7425	m502	RYAN	Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
L483595	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yes, Private.
L483581	u7423	m502	MILLER	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
L483580	u7425	m502	RYAN	FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
L483520	u7425	m502	RYAN	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
L483519	u7423	m502	MILLER	Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
L483496	u7423	m502	MILLER	Struggling with a pair of Germans.
L483495	u7425	m502	RYAN	Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
L483476	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yes, sir.
L483475	u7423	m502	MILLER	You set?  Sarge nods.
L483463	u7425	m502	RYAN	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
L483462	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't do that again.
L483432	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
L483431	u7425	m502	RYAN	I'd like to go, sir.
L483399	u7423	m502	MILLER	Alright, come with me.
L483398	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yes, sir.
L483397	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
L483396	u7425	m502	RYAN	Thank you, sir.
L483378	u7425	m502	RYAN	I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
L483377	u7423	m502	MILLER	The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
L483374	u7423	m502	MILLER	This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
L483373	u7425	m502	RYAN	Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
L483372	u7423	m502	MILLER	Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
L483110	u7424	m502	REIBEN	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
L483109	u7429	m502	WADE	Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
L483085	u7429	m502	WADE	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
L483084	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
L483025	u7429	m502	WADE	Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
L483024	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
L483023	u7429	m502	WADE	Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
L483022	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
L483019	u7429	m502	WADE	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
L483018	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
L483015	u7429	m502	WADE	No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
L483014	u7424	m502	REIBEN	That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
L483013	u7429	m502	WADE	So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
L483097	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
L483096	u7426	m502	SARGE	Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
L483042	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, he's fast!
L483041	u7426	m502	SARGE	Damn fool.  Sir.
L482897	u7426	m502	SARGE	What are we likely to run into?
L482896	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I usually like surprises.
L482787	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yeah?  So?
L482786	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Lingerie.
L482785	u7426	m502	SARGE	Frogs?
L482784	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
L482783	u7426	m502	SARGE	Who cares?
L482778	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
L482777	u7426	m502	SARGE	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
L482776	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Shit, sir.
L483543	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What about you, Captain?
L483542	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
L483250	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
L483249	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483248	u7424	m502	REIBEN	On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
L483193	u7424	m502	REIBEN	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
L483192	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
L482998	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
L482997	u7424	m502	REIBEN	We know.
L482996	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
L482977	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Get lost.
L482976	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So, where are you from?
L483196	u7429	m502	WADE	Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
L483195	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Twenty-four-five.
L483194	u7429	m502	WADE	How fast?
L483021	u7429	m502	WADE	Who knows?  It worked.
L483020	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You think he really believed it?
L483017	u7429	m502	WADE	It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
L483016	u7428	m502	UPHAM	How do you do it?
L482984	u7429	m502	WADE	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
L482983	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Demolition, right?
L486268	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
L486267	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Now you're back.
L486266	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
L486265	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
L486264	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
L486263	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Oskar - my friend Lena.
L485991	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
L485990	u7451	m504	CLERK	The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
L485989	u7451	m504	CLERK	Klaus Tauber.
L485988	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
L485987	u7451	m504	CLERK	Sir, the list is correct.
L485986	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's your name?
L485985	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm talking to a clerk.
L485984	u7451	m504	CLERK	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
L485983	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, let's find him.
L485982	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He is.
L485981	u7451	m504	CLERK	Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
L485980	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
L485882	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's up to you.
L485881	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485880	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's a beautiful city.
L485879	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485878	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
L485877	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485875	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	War.
L485874	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Luck.
L485872	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
L485871	u7452	m504	EMILIE	It's not a charade, all this?
L485863	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
L485862	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
L485861	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What -
L485860	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Oskar, please -
L485859	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You know what, you'd like her.
L486337	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
L486336	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	In Breslau.
L486335	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All right, okay, let's talk.
L486334	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
L486333	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
L486332	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm sorry to hear that.
L486331	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
L486477	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
L486476	u7454	m504	GOETH	Where are the guards?
L486286	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
L486285	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
L486284	u7454	m504	GOETH	You did, but you didn't.
L486283	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I just told you.
L486282	u7454	m504	GOETH	If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
L486280	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, sure.
L486279	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
L486278	u7454	m504	GOETH	You're not telling me something.
L486277	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Look -
L486276	u7454	m504	GOETH	"Oh, this is ""good business"" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense."
L486275	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good business.
L486274	u7454	m504	GOETH	What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
L486273	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	These people, my people, I want my people.
L486272	u7454	m504	GOETH	You want these people.
L486255	u7454	m504	GOETH	I don't know.  Soon.
L486254	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	When?
L486253	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
L486252	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You took my workers.
L486214	u7454	m504	GOETH	I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
L486213	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's going on?
L486212	u7454	m504	GOETH	I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
L486096	u7454	m504	GOETH	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
L486095	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
L486094	u7454	m504	GOETH	He's important to my business.
L486093	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
L486091	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I pay you too much.
L486090	u7454	m504	GOETH	It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
L486064	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
L486063	u7454	m504	GOETH	Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
L486061	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	True.
L486060	u7454	m504	GOETH	That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
L486059	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, what's that?
L486058	u7454	m504	GOETH	Scherner told me something else about you.
L486057	u7454	m504	GOETH	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
L486056	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's bad business.
L486055	u7454	m504	GOETH	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
L486054	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
L486053	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They're mine!
L486052	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're not gone, they're here.
L486051	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
L486049	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
L486048	u7454	m504	GOETH	He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
L486047	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're kidding.
L486046	u7454	m504	GOETH	You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
L486039	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Good.
L486038	u7454	m504	GOETH	We started without you.
L486321	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
L486320	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What do I got for you?
L486319	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
L486318	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Of course I'm on it.
L486317	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
L485820	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah, I can.
L485819	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
L485782	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Look it up.
L485781	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	This is not my problem.
L485780	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
L485779	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	So I'm responsible for the weather?
L485778	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
L485777	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You asked for shoe polish.
L485776	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
L485775	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	What's that?
L485925	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	You're a good man.
L485924	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, okay.
L485923	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	God bless you, sir.
L485922	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great, thanks.
L485921	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
L485920	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great.
L485919	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
L485918	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
L485917	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
L486527	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
L486526	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
L486525	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
L486524	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
L486523	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
L486522	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What are you doing?
L486521	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things are great, things are great.
L486520	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Good.  How's it going?
L486394	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
L486393	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What's wrong with it?
L485904	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	She's good.
L485903	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
L485902	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah.
L485901	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How you feeling, all right?
L485794	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
L485793	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	How many?
L485792	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Nice things cost money.
L485791	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
L485790	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	There's nothing in the stores.
L485789	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Like this?
L486451	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
L486450	u7458	m504	RASCH	Pistols?
L486449	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It kind of looks that way.
L486448	u7458	m504	RASCH	We're losing the war, aren't we.
L486447	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
L486442	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Wine?
L486441	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
L486440	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I need a drink.
L486439	u7458	m504	RASCH	Thank you.
L486437	u7458	m504	RASCH	How do you do?
L486436	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
L486435	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oskar, good of you to come.
L486200	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
L486199	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
L486194	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
L486193	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
L486192	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	So I'll talk to him about it.
L486191	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
L485847	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
L485846	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	That'd be fine.
L485844	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
L485843	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	What others?
L485842	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
L485841	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
L486498	u7461	m504	STERN	You did so much.
L486497	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't do enough.
L486496	u7461	m504	STERN	There will be generations because of what you did.
L486495	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
L486494	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
L486493	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
L486456	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, no, what, what is it?
L486455	u7461	m504	STERN	I'll talk to you later.
L486411	u7461	m504	STERN	You'll lose money.
L486410	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
L486409	u7461	m504	STERN	I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
L486406	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No?
L486405	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
L486404	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
L486403	u7461	m504	STERN	They're withholding payment.
L486402	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
L486399	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They arrived, can you believe it?
L486398	u7461	m504	STERN	They arrived.
L486397	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Stern.
L486396	u7461	m504	STERN	We need to talk.
L486389	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yes.
L486388	u7461	m504	STERN	That's very generous of you.
L486299	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
L486298	u7461	m504	STERN	Eight hundred, give or take.
L486295	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	More.
L486294	u7461	m504	STERN	Four hundred, four fifty -
L486188	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
L486187	u7461	m504	STERN	I think it's too late.
L486186	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll talk to him.
L486161	u7461	m504	STERN	There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
L486160	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
L486159	u7461	m504	STERN	And killing.
L486158	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
L486157	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
L486156	u7461	m504	STERN	What other point is -
L486155	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
L486154	u7461	m504	STERN	Are you losing money?
L486153	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
L486103	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar -
L486102	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I got to go, I'll see you.
L486101	u7461	m504	STERN	Thank you.
L486100	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
L485955	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Ah, yes.
L485954	u7461	m504	STERN	Christmas presents.
L485953	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
L485932	u7461	m504	STERN	Do what?
L485931	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Don't ever do that to me again.
L485914	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
L485913	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485912	u7461	m504	STERN	The war could end.
L485911	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Any reason to think next month will be worse?
L485910	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485909	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Better this month than last?
L485908	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485907	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
L485833	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
L485832	u7461	m504	STERN	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
L485831	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
L485774	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They should be.
L485773	u7461	m504	STERN	I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
L485772	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Something they can hold in their hands.
L485771	u7461	m504	STERN	Pots and pans.
L485770	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
L485769	u7461	m504	STERN	Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
L485768	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Jews, yeah.  Investors.
L485766	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
L485765	u7461	m504	STERN	"Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a ""pleasure."""
L485763	u7461	m504	STERN	I think most people right now have other priorities.
L485762	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
L485759	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
L485758	u7461	m504	STERN	I was just the accountant.
L486196	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
L486195	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	He's stealing from you, Oskar.
L486190	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
L486189	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
L485942	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
L485941	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
L485939	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	No.
L485938	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Would it do any good?
L485937	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
L485936	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
L485935	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
L568344	u8085	m548	MARTIN	Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
L568343	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
L568342	u8085	m548	MARTIN	You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
L568341	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know.
L568340	u8085	m548	MARTIN	On Furtwngler.
L568339	u8081	m548	DAVID	On all what?
L568338	u8085	m548	MARTIN	Where do you stand on all this?
L568501	u8081	m548	DAVID	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
L568500	u8083	m548	EMMI	'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
L568381	u8083	m548	EMMI	I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
L568380	u8081	m548	DAVID	When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
L568379	u8083	m548	EMMI	When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
L568378	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
L568269	u8081	m548	DAVID	But I promised your mother.
L568268	u8083	m548	EMMI	Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
L568262	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know.
L568261	u8083	m548	EMMI	What does he mean, too correct?
L568125	u8081	m548	DAVID	Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
L568124	u8083	m548	EMMI	And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
L568123	u8081	m548	DAVID	Eating is eating... and...
L568122	u8083	m548	EMMI	And no elbows on the table!
L568121	u8081	m548	DAVID	Respect your elders and your betters!
L568120	u8083	m548	EMMI	Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
L568119	u8081	m548	DAVID	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
L568118	u8083	m548	EMMI	That's because you had a proper upbringing.
L568490	u8088	m548	STEVE	What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
L568489	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
L568488	u8088	m548	STEVE	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
L568487	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
L568486	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
L568485	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
L568484	u8088	m548	STEVE	With more what? More what?
L568483	u8081	m548	DAVID	When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
L568482	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah.
L568481	u8081	m548	DAVID	Can I ask you a favour, Major?
L568471	u8088	m548	STEVE	My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
L568470	u8081	m548	DAVID	Your manner.
L568469	u8088	m548	STEVE	What?
L568464	u8088	m548	STEVE	But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
L568463	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
L568458	u8088	m548	STEVE	Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
L568457	u8081	m548	DAVID	and totally irrelevant.
L568456	u8088	m548	STEVE	You bet.
L568455	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
L568454	u8088	m548	STEVE	Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
L568449	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
L568448	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
L568447	u8088	m548	STEVE	You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
L568410	u8081	m548	DAVID	Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
L568409	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yes, David?
L568153	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
L568152	u8088	m548	STEVE	You have a question for Helmuth, David?
L568137	u8088	m548	STEVE	It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
L568136	u8081	m548	DAVID	Five minutes.
L568135	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
L568134	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's big of him.
L568133	u8081	m548	DAVID	Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
L568132	u8088	m548	STEVE	Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
L568131	u8081	m548	DAVID	I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
L568130	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's that mean?
L568129	u8081	m548	DAVID	The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
L568128	u8088	m548	STEVE	So what is it?
L568127	u8081	m548	DAVID	Yes.
L568126	u8088	m548	STEVE	David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
L568098	u8081	m548	DAVID	They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
L568097	u8088	m548	STEVE	What the hell are they doing?
L568096	u8088	m548	STEVE	'Dim-shits'?
L568095	u8081	m548	DAVID	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
L568094	u8088	m548	STEVE	So, what does the Russki want?
L568093	u8081	m548	DAVID	I guess it's possible.
L568092	u8088	m548	STEVE	You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
L568049	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
L568048	u8081	m548	DAVID	Some.
L568047	u8088	m548	STEVE	I guess you admire musicians.
L568042	u8081	m548	DAVID	was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
L568041	u8088	m548	STEVE	Where you from, David?
L568040	u8088	m548	STEVE	You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
L568039	u8081	m548	DAVID	I guess so, sir.
L568038	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
L568037	u8081	m548	DAVID	David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
L568036	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm Steve. What's your name?
L568035	u8081	m548	DAVID	I'm very sorry.
L568034	u8088	m548	STEVE	For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
L568033	u8081	m548	DAVID	Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
L568376	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Then you're going to kill me.
L568375	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
L568374	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
L568373	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have a duty.
L568372	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Let Furtwngler go. Please.
L568371	u8088	m548	STEVE	No can do.
L568370	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
L568369	u8088	m548	STEVE	What museum?
L568368	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
L568367	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
L568366	u8088	m548	STEVE	This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
L568365	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
L568364	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
L568363	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
L568362	u8088	m548	STEVE	But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
L568361	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
L568360	u8088	m548	STEVE	Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
L568358	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
L568357	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
L568355	u8088	m548	STEVE	We're dealing with degenerates here.
L568354	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Furtwngler's in a different category.
L568353	u8088	m548	STEVE	I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
L568111	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
L568110	u8088	m548	STEVE	Not yet.
L568109	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
L568108	u8088	m548	STEVE	Colonel. Pleasure.
L568107	u8082	m548	DYMSHITZ	Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
L568480	u8083	m548	EMMI	I would like to go now, please.
L568479	u8088	m548	STEVE	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
L568478	u8083	m548	EMMI	But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
L568477	u8088	m548	STEVE	Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
L568476	u8083	m548	EMMI	I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
L568475	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's not right?
L568474	u8083	m548	EMMI	I can't do this. It's not right.
L568473	u8088	m548	STEVE	What is this, Emmi?
L568472	u8083	m548	EMMI	I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
L568385	u8088	m548	STEVE	Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
L568384	u8083	m548	EMMI	Of course.
L568383	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know where the Adagio begins?
L568382	u8083	m548	EMMI	Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
L568167	u8088	m548	STEVE	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
L568166	u8083	m548	EMMI	Major, Major... he's here ...
L568045	u8088	m548	STEVE	Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
L568044	u8083	m548	EMMI	I'm sorry.
L568031	u8088	m548	STEVE	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
L568030	u8083	m548	EMMI	The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
L568029	u8088	m548	STEVE	What's in those files?
L568028	u8083	m548	EMMI	No. Ours was damaged.
L568027	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
L568026	u8083	m548	EMMI	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
L568025	u8088	m548	STEVE	Mine's the Eleventh.
L568024	u8083	m548	EMMI	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
L568023	u8088	m548	STEVE	Think you can get me any of that?
L568021	u8083	m548	EMMI	There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
L568020	u8088	m548	STEVE	Steve.
L568015	u8088	m548	STEVE	And your father was executed.
L568014	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
L568013	u8088	m548	STEVE	Your mother, too.
L568012	u8083	m548	EMMI	My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
L568011	u8088	m548	STEVE	Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
L568010	u8083	m548	EMMI	Three months.
L568009	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
L568008	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes.
L568007	u8088	m548	STEVE	You do shorthand and typing?
L568006	u8083	m548	EMMI	Yes.
L568005	u8088	m548	STEVE	You live here, in Berlin?
L568516	u8088	m548	STEVE	Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
L568515	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
L568514	u8088	m548	STEVE	Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
L568511	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
L568510	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	How can I know such a thing?
L568507	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who's conducting?
L568506	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
L568505	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, so what is it?
L568504	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Of course I know what that is.
L568503	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know what that is?
L568496	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
L568495	u8088	m548	STEVE	I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
L568494	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Those attitudes do not exist in me.
L568493	u8088	m548	STEVE	Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
L568467	u8088	m548	STEVE	No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
L568466	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't understand what you mean.
L568465	u8088	m548	STEVE	Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
L568462	u8088	m548	STEVE	But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
L568461	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
L568460	u8088	m548	STEVE	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
L568459	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Stop this, please, stop this now!
L568453	u8088	m548	STEVE	You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
L568452	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
L568451	u8088	m548	STEVE	What?
L568450	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have illegitimate children.
L568446	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
L568445	u8088	m548	STEVE	Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
L568444	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	This is absolute nonsense!
L568443	u8088	m548	STEVE	Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
L568441	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, that's what happened.
L568440	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
L568439	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
L568436	u8088	m548	STEVE	Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
L568435	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I'm sorry.
L568434	u8088	m548	STEVE	You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
L568433	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have no idea.
L568432	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what happened to Von der Nul?
L568431	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
L568430	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what did he say?
L568429	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
L568428	u8088	m548	STEVE	You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
L568427	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That's an outrageous lie!
L568426	u8088	m548	STEVE	Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
L568425	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, I know who he is.
L568424	u8088	m548	STEVE	How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
L568423	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Von der Null?
L568422	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yes, von der Null.
L568421	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Von der Null?
L568420	u8088	m548	STEVE	Tell me about von der Null.
L568419	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
L568418	u8088	m548	STEVE	No!
L568417	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	have no idea what ordinary people thought.
L568416	u8088	m548	STEVE	You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
L568415	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
L568414	u8088	m548	STEVE	Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
L568413	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Then you are wrong.
L568412	u8088	m548	STEVE	Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
L568411	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
L568408	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
L568407	u8088	m548	STEVE	Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
L568406	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
L568405	u8088	m548	STEVE	The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
L568404	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have no idea what you're talking about.
L568403	u8088	m548	STEVE	'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
L568402	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	What telegram?
L568401	u8088	m548	STEVE	And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
L568400	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
L568399	u8088	m548	STEVE	Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
L568398	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
L568397	u8088	m548	STEVE	And what was that?
L568396	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
L568395	u8088	m548	STEVE	Go ahead, be my guest.
L568394	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I wish to say something.
L568393	u8088	m548	STEVE	If it's too hot, open your tie.
L568387	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
L568386	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
L568250	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
L568249	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
L568248	u8088	m548	STEVE	What did Goering say?
L568247	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
L568246	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who warned you?
L568245	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I was warned.
L568244	u8088	m548	STEVE	How?
L568243	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I wasn't told. I just knew it.
L568242	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who?
L568241	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
L568240	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
L568239	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
L568238	u8088	m548	STEVE	I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568232	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
L568231	u8088	m548	STEVE	Steve Arnold...
L568226	u8088	m548	STEVE	See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
L568225	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
L568224	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
L568222	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
L568221	u8088	m548	STEVE	You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
L568220	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
L568219	u8088	m548	STEVE	You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
L568218	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
L568217	u8088	m548	STEVE	So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
L568216	u8088	m548	STEVE	You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
L568215	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
L568214	u8088	m548	STEVE	Why were they going to arrest you?
L568213	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
L568212	u8088	m548	STEVE	I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
L568211	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
L568210	u8088	m548	STEVE	Tough, tough!
L568209	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
L568208	u8088	m548	STEVE	Your guess is as good as mine.
L568207	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
L568206	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sure.
L568205	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	May I ask a question?
L568204	u8088	m548	STEVE	Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
L568203	u8088	m548	STEVE	Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
L568202	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
L568201	u8088	m548	STEVE	Did you call someone you knew?
L568200	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
L568199	u8088	m548	STEVE	I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
L568198	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	It's the truth.
L568197	u8088	m548	STEVE	I don't buy that.
L568196	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I made no deal!
L568192	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
L568191	u8088	m548	STEVE	How come?
L568190	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
L568189	u8088	m548	STEVE	That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
L568188	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
L568187	u8088	m548	STEVE	Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
L568184	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
L568183	u8088	m548	STEVE	Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
L568182	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
L568181	u8088	m548	STEVE	What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
L568180	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
L568179	u8088	m548	STEVE	Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
L568178	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	That is correct.
L568177	u8088	m548	STEVE	What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568176	u8084	m548	FURTWNGLER	I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
L568175	u8088	m548	STEVE	I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
L568336	u8088	m548	STEVE	His private life?
L568335	u8086	m548	RODE	And ask him about his private life.
L568334	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
L568333	u8088	m548	STEVE	The Miracle Kid.
L568332	u8086	m548	RODE	Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
L568331	u8088	m548	STEVE	Who's he?
L568330	u8086	m548	RODE	Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
L568329	u8088	m548	STEVE	Never heard of him, who is he?
L568328	u8086	m548	RODE	There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
L568327	u8086	m548	RODE	No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
L568326	u8088	m548	STEVE	But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
L568325	u8088	m548	STEVE	Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
L568324	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
L568323	u8088	m548	STEVE	One of my people?
L568322	u8086	m548	RODE	One of your people told me.
L568321	u8088	m548	STEVE	He did?
L568320	u8086	m548	RODE	Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
L568319	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah?
L568318	u8086	m548	RODE	I've remembered something else...
L568317	u8088	m548	STEVE	Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
L568316	u8086	m548	RODE	The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
L568315	u8088	m548	STEVE	Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
L568314	u8086	m548	RODE	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
L568313	u8088	m548	STEVE	I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
L568309	u8086	m548	RODE	You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
L568308	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
L568307	u8086	m548	RODE	I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
L568306	u8088	m548	STEVE	Was a member of...?  Speak up?
L568300	u8088	m548	STEVE	One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
L568299	u8086	m548	RODE	What?
L568298	u8088	m548	STEVE	All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
L568297	u8086	m548	RODE	You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
L568296	u8086	m548	RODE	So. You wanted to see me.
L568295	u8088	m548	STEVE	Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
L568293	u8088	m548	STEVE	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
L568292	u8086	m548	RODE	Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
L568291	u8088	m548	STEVE	And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
L568288	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do it, Helmuth.
L568287	u8086	m548	RODE	Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
L568286	u8088	m548	STEVE	Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
L568285	u8086	m548	RODE	Show you?
L568284	u8088	m548	STEVE	Show me.
L568283	u8088	m548	STEVE	How could I forget?
L568282	u8086	m548	RODE	Yes, you remember.
L568281	u8088	m548	STEVE	The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
L568280	u8086	m548	RODE	It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
L568279	u8088	m548	STEVE	Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
L568278	u8086	m548	RODE	Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
L568277	u8088	m548	STEVE	Helmuth.
L568276	u8086	m548	RODE	Major.
L568163	u8086	m548	RODE	How could I know what's in the archive?
L568162	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know what's in this archive?
L568161	u8086	m548	RODE	I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
L568160	u8086	m548	RODE	Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
L568159	u8088	m548	STEVE	You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
L568158	u8086	m548	RODE	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568157	u8088	m548	STEVE	That's what I asked.
L568156	u8086	m548	RODE	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568155	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568154	u8086	m548	RODE	Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
L568145	u8086	m548	RODE	Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
L568144	u8088	m548	STEVE	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
L568143	u8086	m548	RODE	Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
L568141	u8086	m548	RODE	Me? Never.  Never.
L568140	u8088	m548	STEVE	Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
L568139	u8086	m548	RODE	It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
L568138	u8088	m548	STEVE	Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
L568091	u8088	m548	STEVE	When you got to the crescendo.
L568090	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	I don't know what you mean, Major.
L568089	u8088	m548	STEVE	Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
L568088	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Yes.
L568087	u8088	m548	STEVE	You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
L568085	u8088	m548	STEVE	Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
L568084	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
L568083	u8088	m548	STEVE	Oh! The evening before, I see...
L568080	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
L568079	u8088	m548	STEVE	But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
L568078	u8087	m548	SCHLEE	Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
L567994	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
L567993	u8088	m548	STEVE	Like this bandleader.
L567992	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
L567991	u8088	m548	STEVE	They said I was dogged?
L567990	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Conscientious, determined, dogged.
L567989	u8088	m548	STEVE	Right. Claims assessor.
L567988	u8089	m548	WALLACE	You were in insurance before the war.
L567987	u8088	m548	STEVE	Jeez, and I never heard of him.
L567986	u8089	m548	WALLACE	He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
L567985	u8088	m548	STEVE	Sure.
L567984	u8089	m548	WALLACE	Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
L567983	u8088	m548	STEVE	Nope.
L567982	u8089	m548	WALLACE	So, you never heard of him.
L568071	u8088	m548	STEVE	Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
L568070	u8090	m548	WERNER	It was Beethoven's Ninth.
L568069	u8088	m548	STEVE	Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
L568068	u8090	m548	WERNER	Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
L568067	u8088	m548	STEVE	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
L568066	u8090	m548	WERNER	It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
L568065	u8088	m548	STEVE	Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
L568064	u8090	m548	WERNER	Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
L568060	u8088	m548	STEVE	Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
L568059	u8090	m548	WERNER	No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
L568058	u8090	m548	WERNER	Absolutely not.
L568057	u8088	m548	STEVE	I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568056	u8090	m548	WERNER	First oboe.
L568055	u8088	m548	STEVE	Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
L598449	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Tremoille... don't.  Please...
L598448	u8315	m565	AULON	What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
L598444	u8315	m565	AULON	No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
L598443	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
L598442	u8315	m565	AULON	But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
L598441	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
L598440	u8315	m565	AULON	We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
L598439	u8322	m565	CHARLES	It's a miracle she's not dead!
L598438	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
L598437	u8322	m565	CHARLES	My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
L598381	u8315	m565	AULON	10,000 gold crowns.
L598380	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Very generous of you all.  How much?
L598379	u8315	m565	AULON	Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
L597838	u8315	m565	AULON	Yes, my lord.
L597837	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
L597801	u8322	m565	CHARLES	So... pretend it's not a game.
L597800	u8315	m565	AULON	Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
L597798	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
L597797	u8315	m565	AULON	Of course I am, it's just that...
L597796	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
L597795	u8315	m565	AULON	Majesty, I can't...
L597794	u8322	m565	CHARLES	My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
L597793	u8315	m565	AULON	My lord, I'm not sure that...
L597792	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
L597783	u8322	m565	CHARLES	... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
L597782	u8315	m565	AULON	Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
L597781	u8322	m565	CHARLES	What do you mean?
L597780	u8315	m565	AULON	That's a good idea, sire.
L597779	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
L598827	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
L598826	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
L598825	u8315	m565	AULON	No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
L598824	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm staying, Jean.
L598823	u8315	m565	AULON	... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
L598822	u8315	m565	AULON	You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
L598821	u8329	m565	JEANNE	One day you will.
L598820	u8315	m565	AULON	I -- I don't understand...
L598819	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
L598818	u8315	m565	AULON	Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
L598817	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm already free...
L598816	u8315	m565	AULON	Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
L598815	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I am ready now...
L598347	u8329	m565	JEANNE	That's an order!
L598346	u8315	m565	AULON	I want to stay with you...
L598345	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Do as I say!
L598344	u8315	m565	AULON	But... why... what's the point?
L598343	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
L598341	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not yet!
L598340	u8315	m565	AULON	We must sound the retreat!
L598339	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It would not be the same without you.
L598338	u8315	m565	AULON	Will you at least let me stay with you?
L598337	u8329	m565	JEANNE	If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
L598336	u8315	m565	AULON	To be killed in battle?
L598335	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But it is what I want.
L598334	u8315	m565	AULON	But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
L598333	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
L598332	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
L598331	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
L598330	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
L598329	u8315	m565	AULON	To marry you.
L598328	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
L598327	u8315	m565	AULON	Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
L598326	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, but...
L598325	u8315	m565	AULON	Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
L598324	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
L598323	u8315	m565	AULON	He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
L598322	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What did the king say?
L598321	u8315	m565	AULON	You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
L598320	u8329	m565	JEANNE	That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
L598302	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Tell the king to give me more men.
L598301	u8315	m565	AULON	Tell me...
L598300	u8329	m565	JEANNE	If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
L598298	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
L598297	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
L598296	u8315	m565	AULON	Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
L598295	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
L598294	u8315	m565	AULON	You make it sound so simple...
L598293	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know it.  I feel it.
L598292	u8315	m565	AULON	But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
L598291	u8329	m565	JEANNE	All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
L598290	u8315	m565	AULON	But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
L598289	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
L598288	u8315	m565	AULON	But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
L598287	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
L598286	u8315	m565	AULON	Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
L598285	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
L598284	u8315	m565	AULON	What... what do you mean?
L598283	u8329	m565	JEANNE	They've abandoned me... like everyone.
L598281	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So... what am I supposed to do now?
L598280	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
L598242	u8315	m565	AULON	Because there's an arrow in your leg.
L598241	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
L598240	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
L598193	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, no...
L598192	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'll go.
L598149	u8315	m565	AULON	It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
L598148	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes...
L598147	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
L598114	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Come with me...
L598113	u8315	m565	AULON	Well...
L598112	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The king said you're his finest archer...?
L598071	u8315	m565	AULON	I promise...
L598070	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
L598062	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
L598061	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
L598060	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
L598016	u8329	m565	JEANNE	They've started the battle without me!
L598015	u8315	m565	AULON	What's going on?!
L598012	u8315	m565	AULON	But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
L598011	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Good.
L598010	u8315	m565	AULON	Uh... they said... they will think about it.
L598009	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What did they say?
L597997	u8315	m565	AULON	Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
L597996	u8329	m565	JEANNE	How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
L597995	u8315	m565	AULON	He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
L597994	u8329	m565	JEANNE	How dare you stop me doing God's will!
L597993	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, stop it!
L597961	u8329	m565	JEANNE	There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
L597960	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
L597959	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Who do they think I am?!
L597869	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
L597868	u8315	m565	AULON	Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
L597867	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I thought you were an archer?
L597866	u8315	m565	AULON	This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
L597865	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I also need someone who can read and write.
L597864	u8315	m565	AULON	Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
L597863	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Better today than tomorrow.
L597862	u8315	m565	AULON	Now?
L597861	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
L597860	u8315	m565	AULON	Right.  Raymond... a priest.
L597859	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes.  I didn't confess today.
L597858	u8315	m565	AULON	Now?
L597857	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And I would like to see a priest.
L597856	u8315	m565	AULON	Louis... water and fresh straw!
L597855	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I would like some fresh straw.
L597853	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Do you think I could have some water?
L597852	u8315	m565	AULON	Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
L598082	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
L598081	u8315	m565	AULON	But that was her order!
L598080	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
L598079	u8315	m565	AULON	But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
L598078	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Sound the retreat...
L598077	u8315	m565	AULON	We have to press home the attack!
L598076	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Good.
L598075	u8315	m565	AULON	Jeanne's alive!
L598666	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, I... I never killed anyone!
L598665	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
L598664	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
L598663	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
L598662	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, I... I held it up to...
L598661	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
L598660	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, but...
L598659	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
L598658	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, probably... maybe...
L598657	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
L598656	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
L598655	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
L598654	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
L598653	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
L598652	u8329	m565	JEANNE	To avoid killing anyone.
L598651	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Why?
L598650	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And so I... I prefer my banner.
L598649	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	And?
L598648	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
L598647	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
L598646	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
L598645	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
L598644	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes...
L598643	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Didn't you also carry a banner?
L598642	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Quite a few.
L598641	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Do you have a sword?
L598625	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I leave the answer to God.
L598624	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
L598623	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I can't read.
L598622	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
L598621	u8329	m565	JEANNE	"No... I said ""Surrender in the name of the King of France""..."
L598620	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
L598619	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know...
L598618	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
L598617	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't remember.  Maybe.
L598616	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
L598615	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I tried to.
L598614	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
L598564	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
L598563	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
L598562	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Go onto the next question.
L598544	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
L598543	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
L598542	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No...
L598541	u8316	m565	BEAUPERE	You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
L598540	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
L598233	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Performing a miracle.
L598232	u8317	m565	BISHOP	W-w-what are you doing?!
L598231	u8317	m565	BISHOP	No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
L598230	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
L598229	u8317	m565	BISHOP	Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
L598228	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	And when was that?
L598227	u8317	m565	BISHOP	I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
L598213	u8317	m565	BISHOP	Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
L598212	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
L598715	u8318	m565	BUCK	Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
L598714	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
L598713	u8318	m565	BUCK	Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
L598712	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
L598711	u8318	m565	BUCK	Scared of a girl?
L598710	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
L598709	u8318	m565	BUCK	Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
L598708	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
L598707	u8318	m565	BUCK	... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
L598706	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
L598705	u8318	m565	BUCK	So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
L598704	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
L598703	u8318	m565	BUCK	How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
L598702	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
L598579	u8318	m565	BUCK	Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
L598578	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
L598577	u8318	m565	BUCK	We want her burned as a witch!
L598576	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
L598575	u8318	m565	BUCK	To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
L598574	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
L598572	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
L598571	u8318	m565	BUCK	Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
L598505	u8318	m565	BUCK	Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
L598504	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
L598503	u8318	m565	BUCK	Arrest them!
L598377	u8319	m565	BURGUNDY	And God who allowed you to be caught?
L598376	u8329	m565	JEANNE	God defeated the English, not me.
L598375	u8319	m565	BURGUNDY	Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
L598374	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My king will pay any ransom you ask.
L598373	u8319	m565	BURGUNDY	Guess.
L598372	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Where... where am I?
L598371	u8319	m565	BURGUNDY	Dead you're worthless, darling.
L598370	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Am I... am I dead?
L598369	u8319	m565	BURGUNDY	So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
L597699	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	I'll be right here... I promise.
L597698	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But where are you going to be?
L597697	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
L597696	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What about you?
L597695	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	Quick -- hide in here...
L597693	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
L597692	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	Really?
L597690	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
L597689	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No no, I'm fine, really...
L597688	u8320	m565	CATHERINE	Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
L598807	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
L598806	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
L598805	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
L598804	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
L598803	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
L598802	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
L598792	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Silence her!  Take her away...!
L598791	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
L598790	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	You have nothing to regret...
L598789	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Please... may I have it back...
L598784	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
L598783	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And may I go to Mass?
L598782	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
L598781	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No... I want to be confessed.
L598780	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
L598601	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
L598600	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
L598599	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
L598598	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
L598569	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
L598568	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes...
L598567	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
L598561	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
L598560	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Many things...
L598559	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	What did it tell you?
L598558	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes.
L598557	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	The voice was in your cell?
L598556	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Praying.
L598555	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	What were you doing when the voice came?
L598554	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Last night.
L598553	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
L598552	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not long ago...
L598551	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
L598550	u8329	m565	JEANNE	These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
L598549	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
L598488	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
L598487	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
L598486	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not unless you hear my confession.
L598485	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
L598484	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not unless you hear my confession.
L598483	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Recite the Lord's Prayer.
L598482	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
L598481	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Were you baptized?
L598480	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Nineteen... or thereabouts...
L598479	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	How old are you?
L598478	u8329	m565	JEANNE	In a village called Domremy.
L598477	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
L598476	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
L598475	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
L598474	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
L598473	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
L598472	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
L598471	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
L598470	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
L598469	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
L598412	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
L598411	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The English??
L598410	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
L598409	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
L598408	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
L598407	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Trial?  What trial??
L598406	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
L598405	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Who are you?
L598404	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	I will hear you... but not now, not here.
L598403	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
L598399	u8324	m565	DIJON	Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
L598398	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
L598391	u8324	m565	DIJON	I understand.  How much?
L598390	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
L598389	u8324	m565	DIJON	Buying her?
L598388	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
L598387	u8324	m565	DIJON	And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
L598386	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Thanks be to God.
L598385	u8324	m565	DIJON	He's feeling wonderful.
L598384	u8321	m565	CAUCHON	Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
L598316	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Then her faith will have to be bigger.
L598315	u8322	m565	CHARLES	But... her army's so small now...
L598314	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
L598307	u8322	m565	CHARLES	I... I can't stop her.
L598306	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
L598305	u8322	m565	CHARLES	It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
L597878	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
L597877	u8322	m565	CHARLES	You will??
L597768	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
L597767	u8322	m565	CHARLES	You really think she's been sent... by God?
L597766	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
L597765	u8322	m565	CHARLES	W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
L597764	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
L597763	u8322	m565	CHARLES	You think?
L597762	u8338	m565	YOLANDE	Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
L598275	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
L598274	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
L598273	u8322	m565	CHARLES	"Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, ""to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace""..."
L598272	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So how would you put it?
L598271	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
L598270	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
L598269	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
L598268	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Get them out of here!
L598236	u8322	m565	CHARLES	... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
L598235	u8329	m565	JEANNE	... You look wonderful...
L598234	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
L597840	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
L597839	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
L597833	u8329	m565	JEANNE	He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
L597832	u8322	m565	CHARLES	... and what... what did he say?
L597830	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
L597829	u8322	m565	CHARLES	You did well...
L597828	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
L597810	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
L597809	u8322	m565	CHARLES	I'm... I'm not the king...
L597808	u8329	m565	JEANNE	There's no need to be afraid, sire.
L598311	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	Noooo!
L598310	u8322	m565	CHARLES	I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
L598208	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
L598207	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
L598206	u8322	m565	CHARLES	He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
L597875	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
L597874	u8322	m565	CHARLES	My captains have sworn their support.
L597820	u8322	m565	CHARLES	... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
L597819	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	... as always, majesty...
L597818	u8322	m565	CHARLES	My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
L597817	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	Your majesty, I really think you...
L597776	u8322	m565	CHARLES	Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
L597775	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	Supposing she's an assassin?
L597774	u8322	m565	CHARLES	My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
L597773	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
L597757	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	The other half.
L597756	u8322	m565	CHARLES	I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
L597755	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
L597752	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	"If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed ""X"".  What sort of name is ""X""?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?"
L597751	u8322	m565	CHARLES	What difference does it make where she comes from?
L597750	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
L597749	u8322	m565	CHARLES	She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
L597748	u8336	m565	TREMOILLE	She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
L598588	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
L598587	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Go on to the next question.
L598586	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
L598585	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
L598584	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	Is it long and hanging down?
L598583	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes.
L598582	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	Does he have hair?
L598581	u8329	m565	JEANNE	His face.
L598580	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
L598548	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Go and ask him yourself.
L598547	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
L598546	u8329	m565	JEANNE	If there was, I didn't see it...
L598545	u8323	m565	D'ESTIVET	When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
L598401	u8324	m565	DIJON	I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
L598400	u8334	m565	REGNAULT	8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
L598397	u8324	m565	DIJON	20,000 gold crowns.
L598396	u8334	m565	REGNAULT	May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
L598395	u8324	m565	DIJON	I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
L598394	u8334	m565	REGNAULT	It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
L598393	u8324	m565	DIJON	That's not a lot.
L598392	u8334	m565	REGNAULT	5,000 gold crowns.
L598191	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	The English won't wait.
L598190	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not yet.
L598189	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Well...?  Shall we go?
L598127	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The bridge won't wait!
L598126	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	We need another ten minutes...
L598125	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Stand by with the battering-rams...
L598103	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
L598102	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
L598098	u8329	m565	JEANNE	We're taking back the Tourelles!
L598097	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	What's going on?
L598040	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
L598039	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	The wind will be against us...
L598038	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
L598028	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Sooner is better than later!
L598027	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
L598026	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
L597985	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
L597984	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
L597983	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
L597982	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
L597981	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Be patient, be patient... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
L597979	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
L597978	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
L597977	u8329	m565	JEANNE	You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
L597973	u8329	m565	JEANNE	God.
L597972	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
L597971	u8329	m565	JEANNE	We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
L597970	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	So... what is the message?
L597950	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
L597949	u8329	m565	JEANNE	You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
L597948	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
L597947	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
L597946	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
L597945	u8329	m565	JEANNE	For what?
L597944	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Wait, wait...
L597935	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	He's on the other side of the river.
L597934	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Good.  Can you bring me to him?
L597933	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	I know...
L597932	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
L597931	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Everywhere.  Where is the food?
L597930	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Good.  Where are the English?
L597929	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Yes... they were.
L597928	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
L597919	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
L597918	u8337	m565	XAINTRAILLES	But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
L597917	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
L597916	u8337	m565	XAINTRAILLES	And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
L597915	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Yes, it's a miracle.
L597914	u8337	m565	XAINTRAILLES	The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
L597913	u8325	m565	DUNOIS	Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
L597912	u8337	m565	XAINTRAILLES	My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
L598249	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	No good?  This is a disaster!
L598248	u8326	m565	GILLES	This is no good!
L598055	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Good idea...
L598054	u8326	m565	GILLES	Yes.  We can pray.
L598053	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
L597989	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Me too...
L597988	u8326	m565	GILLES	I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
L597976	u8326	m565	GILLES	Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
L597975	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Damn right!
L597974	u8326	m565	GILLES	God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
L597850	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	That'll put fire in my soldiers!
L597849	u8326	m565	GILLES	Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
L598264	u8326	m565	GILLES	To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
L598263	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But my voices... they promised me...
L598262	u8326	m565	GILLES	He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
L598261	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
L598260	u8326	m565	GILLES	Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
L598259	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Of course I do?  Bring them up!
L598258	u8326	m565	GILLES	Do you know how to count?
L598257	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Never look behind -- only ahead!
L598256	u8326	m565	GILLES	Jeanne, look behind you.
L598255	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
L598254	u8326	m565	GILLES	Reinforcements?  Where??
L598253	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So... bring up the reinforcements!
L598252	u8326	m565	GILLES	Jeanne... we're not enough...
L598251	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
L598250	u8326	m565	GILLES	Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
L598182	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
L598181	u8326	m565	GILLES	Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
L598174	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
L598173	u8326	m565	GILLES	Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
L598159	u8326	m565	GILLES	For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
L598158	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No... not like this...
L598157	u8326	m565	GILLES	You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
L598120	u8326	m565	GILLES	Perfectly.
L598119	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Clear?
L598034	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The English are rebuilding it.
L598033	u8326	m565	GILLES	But the bridge has been pulled down!
L598032	u8329	m565	JEANNE	We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
L597969	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
L597968	u8326	m565	GILLES	And... what does Jeanne think?
L598597	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
L598596	u8327	m565	JEAN LE MAISTRE	But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
L598595	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I... submit to Our Lord.
L598594	u8327	m565	JEAN LE MAISTRE	So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
L598593	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
L598592	u8327	m565	JEAN LE MAISTRE	You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
L598591	u8329	m565	JEANNE	The clothes are not important...
L598590	u8327	m565	JEAN LE MAISTRE	Who told you to wear men's clothes?
L598640	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
L598639	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No!
L598638	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	And you didn't jump of your free will?
L598637	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, but...
L598636	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
L598635	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I know, but that's not the way things happened...
L598634	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
L598633	u8329	m565	JEANNE	That's now what I meant...
L598632	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	"How can you deny it when you just said ""I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English""...?"
L598631	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No...!
L598630	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
L598629	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No...
L598628	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	Did your voice tell you to jump?
L598627	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
L598626	u8328	m565	JEAN MIDI	Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
L598178	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Here -- take this instead.
L598177	u8335	m565	SOLDIER	Yeah...
L598167	u8329	m565	JEANNE	That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
L598166	u8335	m565	SOLDIER	Besides, what about these...?
L598164	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Because... because you just can't!
L598163	u8335	m565	SOLDIER	Why not?  He has good teeth...
L598162	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
L598161	u8335	m565	SOLDIER	Nothing... just taking his teeth.
L598160	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Stop it!  What are you doing?
L598266	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
L598265	u8329	m565	JEANNE	You don't believe me anymore?
L598186	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I said, kneel!
L598185	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
L598176	u8329	m565	JEANNE	A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
L598175	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
L598172	u8329	m565	JEANNE	If you kill him, you kill me!
L598171	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
L598170	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
L598156	u8329	m565	JEANNE	It's not possible...
L598155	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
L598154	u8329	m565	JEANNE	You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
L598152	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
L598151	u8329	m565	JEANNE	We... won?!
L598111	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Not for long...
L598110	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
L598109	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Prepare these as battering-rams!
L598066	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'd sooner die than use magic!
L598065	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
L598057	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Don't swear...
L598056	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
L598024	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
L598023	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
L598022	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
L597952	u8329	m565	JEANNE	They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
L597951	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
L597943	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
L597942	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
L597939	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
L597938	u8329	m565	JEANNE	La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
L597937	u8330	m565	LA HIRE	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
L597936	u8329	m565	JEANNE	So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
L598613	u8329	m565	JEANNE	And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
L598612	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
L598611	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
L598610	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
L598609	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No.
L598608	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
L598607	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Five steeds and a few hackneys...
L598606	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	How many did he give you?
L598605	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My king.
L598604	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	Who gave you that horse?
L598603	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes... a half-steed... white.
L598602	u8331	m565	MAITRE MAURICE	When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
L598812	u8332	m565	MAN	Let's see.
L598811	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, my lord.
L598810	u8332	m565	MAN	You think you are ready now?
L598788	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No...
L598787	u8332	m565	MAN	You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
L598743	u8332	m565	MAN	... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
L598742	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes...
L598741	u8332	m565	MAN	Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
L598740	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes I am.
L598739	u8332	m565	MAN	Do you think you are ready?
L598738	u8329	m565	JEANNE	There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
L598734	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Are you sent by God?
L598733	u8332	m565	MAN	Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
L598732	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Are you going to leave me too?
L598731	u8332	m565	MAN	I don't think so.
L598730	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
L598729	u8332	m565	MAN	"Good.  But ""love your enemies""... body and soul."
L598728	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Love your enemies...
L598725	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, I...
L598724	u8332	m565	MAN	Do you think this cross will protect you?
L598723	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
L598722	u8332	m565	MAN	What for?
L598721	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
L598720	u8332	m565	MAN	What are you doing on the wall?
L598719	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
L598692	u8332	m565	MAN	Really?
L598691	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
L598690	u8332	m565	MAN	Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
L598689	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
L598688	u8332	m565	MAN	I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
L598686	u8332	m565	MAN	I agree...
L598685	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
L598684	u8332	m565	MAN	No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
L598683	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
L598682	u8332	m565	MAN	Let all who love me follow me... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
L598680	u8332	m565	MAN	Really?
L598679	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
L598678	u8332	m565	MAN	In His name??
L598677	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
L598676	u8332	m565	MAN	Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
L598675	u8329	m565	JEANNE	"Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's ""the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..."" he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?"
L598674	u8332	m565	MAN	So your memory's coming back?
L598673	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
L598671	u8332	m565	MAN	Oh no?  How about this one?
L598670	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
L598669	u8332	m565	MAN	Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
L598668	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
L598531	u8332	m565	MAN	True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
L598530	u8329	m565	JEANNE	But... it didn't just get there by itself.
L598529	u8332	m565	MAN	No.  That was a sword in a field.
L598528	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
L598527	u8332	m565	MAN	What signs?
L598526	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, but... he sent me so many signs!
L598525	u8332	m565	MAN	"You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?"""
L598524	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes... lots of things!
L598523	u8332	m565	MAN	God asked you to do something?
L598522	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
L598521	u8332	m565	MAN	Why would they?
L598520	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What do you mean, they won't come?
L598519	u8332	m565	MAN	They won't come anyway.
L598518	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Because... I have to be alone!
L598517	u8332	m565	MAN	Why not?
L598516	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
L598515	u8332	m565	MAN	I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
L598514	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes... that's what I pray for...!
L598513	u8332	m565	MAN	They're going to come and visit you in here?
L598512	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My... visions...
L598511	u8332	m565	MAN	Who?
L598510	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes!
L598509	u8332	m565	MAN	Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
L598508	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
L598507	u8332	m565	MAN	Why were you yelling like that?!
L598431	u8332	m565	MAN	I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
L598430	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
L598429	u8332	m565	MAN	Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
L598428	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
L598427	u8332	m565	MAN	Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
L598426	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
L598425	u8332	m565	MAN	That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
L598423	u8332	m565	MAN	"How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  ""What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"""
L598422	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
L598421	u8332	m565	MAN	If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
L598420	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I... I never lied!
L598419	u8332	m565	MAN	You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
L598418	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
L598417	u8332	m565	MAN	And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
L598416	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
L598415	u8332	m565	MAN	I might ask you the same question.
L598414	u8329	m565	JEANNE	What are you doing out here?
L598366	u8332	m565	MAN	Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
L598365	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I... don't know... what do you want from me?
L598364	u8332	m565	MAN	WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
L598363	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
L598362	u8332	m565	MAN	YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
L598361	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't know... I thought...
L598359	u8329	m565	JEANNE	No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
L598358	u8332	m565	MAN	Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
L598354	u8332	m565	MAN	I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
L598353	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Who... who are you...?
L598146	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I -- I -- I...
L598145	u8332	m565	MAN	What have you done to me?
L598142	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Playing...
L598141	u8332	m565	MAN	Jeanne... what are you doing?
L597735	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I want to be at one with Him now.
L597734	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
L597733	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I want to be with him always...
L597732	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Jeanne, be patient.
L597731	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I don't want to wait for his call.
L597729	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
L597728	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
L597727	u8333	m565	PRIEST	I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
L597726	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
L597725	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Only God knows the answer to that.
L597724	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Why did she have to die?
L597723	u8333	m565	PRIEST	I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
L597683	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
L597682	u8329	m565	JEANNE	He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
L597681	u8333	m565	PRIEST	And what does he say to you?
L597680	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Beautiful.
L597679	u8333	m565	PRIEST	What... does he... look like?
L597678	u8329	m565	JEANNE	He never says his name.
L597677	u8333	m565	PRIEST	"Who is this ""he""?"
L597676	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
L597675	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Him?
L597674	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
L597673	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Then... why are you here so often?
L597672	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Yes, it is.
L597671	u8333	m565	PRIEST	So... everything sounds... wonderful?
L597668	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
L597667	u8333	m565	PRIEST	And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
L597666	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
L597665	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
L597664	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
L597663	u8333	m565	PRIEST	And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
L597662	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Oh yes... very.
L597661	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
L597660	u8329	m565	JEANNE	Is that bad?
L597659	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
L597658	u8329	m565	JEANNE	He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
L597657	u8333	m565	PRIEST	I'm sure he'll forgive you.
L597656	u8329	m565	JEANNE	My father's.
L597655	u8333	m565	PRIEST	Whose were they?
L597654	u8329	m565	JEANNE	They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
L597653	u8333	m565	PRIEST	There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
L597652	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
L597651	u8333	m565	PRIEST	So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
L597650	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I need to confess again.
L597649	u8333	m565	PRIEST	But you already confessed this morning...
L597648	u8329	m565	JEANNE	I need to confess.
L597647	u8333	m565	PRIEST	You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
L599191	u8339	m566	BENEK	Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
L599190	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
L599189	u8339	m566	BENEK	A beauty. Who is she?
L599188	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes.
L599187	u8339	m566	BENEK	Someone you know?
L599179	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's like this... I...we...all of them.
L599178	u8339	m566	BENEK	Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
L599007	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Who wants me to stop?
L599006	u8339	m566	BENEK	I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
L599347	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He's still a doctor.
L599346	u8351	m566	MICHAL	Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
L599345	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
L599344	u8351	m566	MICHAL	You can't, it's too dangerous.
L599343	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I'm going to get a doctor.
L599314	u8351	m566	MICHAL	Oh, yes. I remember.
L599313	u8340	m566	DOROTA	This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
L599312	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
L599311	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	When's your baby due?
L599310	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Dead.
L599309	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	And how's Yurek?
L599308	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Just over a year.
L599307	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How long have you been married?
L599306	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He'll be here soon.
L599305	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
L599304	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He'll be back before curfew.
L599303	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I need help.
L599302	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
L599301	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
L599300	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Sit.
L599299	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Come in! come in!
L599298	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Dorota.
L599297	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Wladyslaw Szpilman.
L598968	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll see you...soon.
L598967	u8340	m566	DOROTA	That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
L598966	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Don't worry, it won't last long.
L598965	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
L598964	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How are you doing?
L598963	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
L598962	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Dorota!
L598932	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Wladek, please.
L598931	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
L598929	u8340	m566	DOROTA	No one plays Chopin like you.
L598928	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Wladek, please.
L598927	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
L598926	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
L598925	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Really?
L598924	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
L598923	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
L598840	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's nothing.
L598839	u8340	m566	DOROTA	My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
L598838	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Who are you?
L598837	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
L598836	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Hello.
L599045	u8341	m566	FATHER	American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
L599044	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	For what? For my tie?
L598970	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How will we sleep?
L598969	u8341	m566	FATHER	To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
L598937	u8341	m566	FATHER	Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
L598936	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Let me see this.
L598915	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Let's find out.
L598914	u8341	m566	FATHER	Will I still be able to play?
L598854	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you doing?
L598853	u8341	m566	FATHER	What did I tell you?
L599288	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
L599287	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
L599286	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
L599285	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L599284	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	I'm on the run!
L599283	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L599282	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Get your things together, you have to leave!
L599254	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Here.
L599253	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
L599252	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Must feel better this side of the wall.
L599249	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
L599248	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll be fine.
L599247	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	It's not going to be very comfortable.
L599171	u8343	m566	HALINA	Thanks.
L599170	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	wish I knew you better.
L599169	u8343	m566	HALINA	What?
L599168	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Funny time to say this.
L599167	u8343	m566	HALINA	What?
L599166	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Halina?
L599053	u8343	m566	HALINA	They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
L599052	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Calm down, what, what is it?
L599051	u8343	m566	HALINA	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
L599050	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L598944	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What, I'm working, what?
L598943	u8343	m566	HALINA	Have you seen this?
L599074	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	People I know. They said you're an important man.
L599073	u8344	m566	HELLER	Who told you?
L599072	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
L599071	u8344	m566	HELLER	Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
L599070	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've no money.
L599069	u8344	m566	HELLER	It costs.
L599068	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help us?
L599067	u8344	m566	HELLER	Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
L599066	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help?
L599065	u8344	m566	HELLER	Tough luck.
L599064	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Believe me, they've picked him up.
L599063	u8344	m566	HELLER	I haven't seen him.
L599062	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Henryk's in there.
L599004	u8344	m566	HELLER	I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
L599003	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Yes, please.
L599002	u8344	m566	HELLER	Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
L599001	u8345	m566	HENRYK	But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
L599000	u8344	m566	HELLER	Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
L598999	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
L598998	u8344	m566	HELLER	Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
L598997	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Who's recruiting?
L598996	u8344	m566	HELLER	We're recruiting.
L599042	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
L599041	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Boys, boys...
L599037	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
L599036	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Henryk, I said nothing bad.
L599031	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
L599030	u8352	m566	MOTHER	And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
L598992	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
L598991	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What's this about?
L598898	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Do they?
L598897	u8345	m566	HENRYK	The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
L598896	u8352	m566	MOTHER	What d'you mean, take the table away?
L598895	u8345	m566	HENRYK	And suppose they take the table away?
L599159	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Yes, that's why I brought it.
L599158	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Very appropriate.
L599157	u8345	m566	HENRYK	'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
L599156	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you reading?
L599099	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You'll be deported.
L599098	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Otherwise what?
L599097	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
L599096	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's that mean, no employment certificate?
L599095	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Hungry.
L599094	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's the matter? Are you sick?
L599093	u8345	m566	HENRYK	That's also my business.
L599092	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
L599091	u8345	m566	HENRYK	It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
L599090	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	They were taking you away.
L599089	u8345	m566	HENRYK	I can look after myself!
L599088	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
L599087	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What did you pay him?
L599086	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
L599085	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
L599084	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're out, aren't you?
L599083	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
L599040	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
L599039	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
L599038	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's not funny.
L598978	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
L598977	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I know.
L598976	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
L598975	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	That's better than yesterday.
L598974	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
L598973	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You sell anything?
L598950	u8345	m566	HENRYK	No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
L598949	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
L598909	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Just shut up.
L598908	u8345	m566	HENRYK	A good place for what?  He's insane!
L598907	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
L598906	u8345	m566	HENRYK	We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
L598905	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	We use what?
L598904	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You know what we do? We use psychology.
L598903	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	That makes a change.
L598902	u8345	m566	HENRYK	No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
L598882	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It certainly was.
L598881	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Mama, that was a great dinner.
L598857	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Warsaw's not the only radio station.
L598856	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	They bombed us, we're off the air.
L599281	u8346	m566	JANINA	What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
L599280	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, but what good did it do?
L599279	u8346	m566	JANINA	They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
L599278	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, so did the Germans.
L599277	u8346	m566	JANINA	Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
L599276	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
L599275	u8346	m566	JANINA	No one thought they'd hold out so long.
L599113	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
L599112	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help? I've no money...
L599111	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I'm not, but Majorek is.
L599110	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
L599109	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Why didn't you come to me?
L599108	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
L599107	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
L599106	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
L599105	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
L599104	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Not this week.
L599103	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
L599028	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Toilets?
L599027	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
L599022	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	There are always notices going up.
L599021	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
L599020	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
L599019	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	But I want to help, I want to.
L599018	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
L599017	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Jehuda, give me something to do.
L599016	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
L599015	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
L599014	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
L599013	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	So, what's the news?
L599012	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
L599011	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're amazing, Jehuda.
L599010	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
L598922	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
L598921	u8348	m566	JUREK	...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
L598920	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
L598919	u8348	m566	JUREK	Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
L598918	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
L598917	u8348	m566	JUREK	Wladek! How are you?
L598916	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
L599271	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
L599270	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	I was listening, Kitten.
L599269	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
L599267	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Takes one to know one! Pig!
L599266	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	You're a dirty pig!
L599265	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Dirty pig!
L599264	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	Bitch!
L599263	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Pig!
L599262	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	Cow!
L599261	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Pig!
L599260	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
L599259	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	You know what? You treat me like dirt!
L599258	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
L599257	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
L599227	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
L599226	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You made contact?
L599225	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
L599215	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
L599214	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
L599213	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
L599197	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	If you need help...
L599196	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
L599195	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
L599194	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How long have you been here?
L599125	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Stop it, Wladek.
L599124	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
L598876	u8352	m566	MOTHER	God forbid!
L598875	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
L598872	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
L598871	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
L598870	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
L598861	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Out of Warsaw. Where?
L598860	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Out of Warsaw.
L598859	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Where are we going?
L598858	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
L598849	u8352	m566	MOTHER	I've been worried sick.
L598848	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's a little cut, nothing.
L598847	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
L599338	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
L599337	u8354	m566	SZALAS	You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
L599330	u8354	m566	SZALAS	Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
L599329	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Sorry, I don't remember.
L599328	u8354	m566	SZALAS	Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
L599327	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	No, I don't think so?
L599326	u8354	m566	SZALAS	You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
L599395	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
L599394	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Szpilman.
L599393	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
L599392	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
L599391	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
L599390	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What about you?
L599389	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
L599388	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I don't know how to thank you.
L599387	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Not yet.
L599386	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Are the Russians here?
L599385	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	We're getting out.
L599384	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happening?
L599382	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
L599381	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's all that gunfire?
L599376	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Show me.
L599375	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	In the attic.
L599374	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Where are you hiding?
L599370	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	A pianist.
L599369	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I am... I was a pianist.
L599368	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	What's your work?
L599367	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Where do you live?
L599366	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I was... I was trying to open this tin.
L599365	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	What the hell are you doing?
L610257	u8408	m570	EPPS	Nobody's going to hurt you.
L610256	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
L610255	u8408	m570	EPPS	Turn the car around.
L610254	u8407	m570	DRIVER	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
L610253	u8408	m570	EPPS	What's in the other direction?
L610252	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Baghdad.
L610251	u8408	m570	EPPS	Where were you going?
L610250	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Y-yes.
L610249	u8408	m570	EPPS	You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
L610201	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
L610200	u8410	m570	WES	Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
L610198	u8408	m570	EPPS	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
L610197	u8410	m570	WES	Give it to me!
L610184	u8410	m570	WES	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
L610183	u8408	m570	EPPS	So you can give us away?
L610182	u8410	m570	WES	I have to answer him.
L610181	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just keep quiet.
L610177	u8408	m570	EPPS	You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
L610176	u8410	m570	WES	They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
L610169	u8410	m570	WES	That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
L610168	u8408	m570	EPPS	That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
L610167	u8410	m570	WES	You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
L610164	u8408	m570	EPPS	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
L610163	u8410	m570	WES	Thanks for taking care of this for me.
L610160	u8410	m570	WES	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
L610159	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes--
L610158	u8410	m570	WES	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
L610157	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
L610152	u8408	m570	EPPS	We thought--
L610151	u8410	m570	WES	In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
L610009	u8410	m570	WES	Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
L610008	u8408	m570	EPPS	What about Jaeger?
L610007	u8410	m570	WES	Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
L610006	u8408	m570	EPPS	Suppose I don't go for that?
L610005	u8410	m570	WES	I'm the one's got the big stick.
L610004	u8408	m570	EPPS	And let me guess who is.
L610003	u8410	m570	WES	Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
L610002	u8408	m570	EPPS	Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
L610001	u8410	m570	WES	No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
L609978	u8410	m570	WES	What if I do?
L609977	u8408	m570	EPPS	We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
L609976	u8410	m570	WES	In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
L609975	u8408	m570	EPPS	I out rank you, that's why.
L609974	u8410	m570	WES	You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
L609961	u8410	m570	WES	Get out of my way.
L609960	u8408	m570	EPPS	No.
L609959	u8410	m570	WES	Then step aside.
L609958	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
L609957	u8410	m570	WES	It's a combat action.
L609956	u8408	m570	EPPS	I've got no stomach for murder.
L609955	u8410	m570	WES	I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
L609953	u8410	m570	WES	He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
L609952	u8408	m570	EPPS	We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
L609951	u8410	m570	WES	We're at war.
L609950	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'm not going to let you kill him.
L609949	u8410	m570	WES	He's an enemy soldier.
L609948	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're out of your mind.
L609944	u8410	m570	WES	You don't know he isn't.
L609943	u8408	m570	EPPS	You don't know that.
L609942	u8410	m570	WES	That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
L609941	u8408	m570	EPPS	You said he was a deserter.
L609940	u8410	m570	WES	We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
L609938	u8408	m570	EPPS	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
L609937	u8410	m570	WES	I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
L609932	u8410	m570	WES	He...he could have been watching us.
L609931	u8408	m570	EPPS	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
L609930	u8410	m570	WES	Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
L609929	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why'd he come in our camp.
L609928	u8410	m570	WES	Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
L609924	u8410	m570	WES	I told you; don't push me around.
L609923	u8408	m570	EPPS	Stop it!
L609919	u8410	m570	WES	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
L609918	u8408	m570	EPPS	What happened?
L609917	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get off him!
L609916	u8410	m570	WES	He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
L609915	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get off him.
L609910	u8408	m570	EPPS	Then get up and do something about it.
L609909	u8410	m570	WES	You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
L609907	u8408	m570	EPPS	I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
L609906	u8410	m570	WES	You got no reason to do that!
L609905	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
L609904	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe I do.
L609903	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
L609902	u8408	m570	EPPS	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
L609901	u8410	m570	WES	You're the one with all the ideas.
L609898	u8410	m570	WES	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
L609897	u8408	m570	EPPS	We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
L609896	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe we should split it up now.
L609895	u8408	m570	EPPS	What about it?
L609894	u8410	m570	WES	What about the gold?
L609893	u8408	m570	EPPS	It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
L609874	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
L609873	u8410	m570	WES	You ready?
L609866	u8410	m570	WES	Ready when you are.
L609865	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
L609832	u8408	m570	EPPS	I heard!
L609831	u8410	m570	WES	Epps!
L609820	u8408	m570	EPPS	Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
L609819	u8410	m570	WES	What am I supposed to do?
L609818	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
L609804	u8408	m570	EPPS	Move!
L609803	u8410	m570	WES	Missile!
L609800	u8408	m570	EPPS	So we wait.
L609799	u8410	m570	WES	And they can't fly around out there forever.
L609786	u8410	m570	WES	Weird they didn't chase us.
L609785	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
L609784	u8410	m570	WES	Where'd they go?
L609779	u8408	m570	EPPS	Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
L609778	u8410	m570	WES	Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
L609773	u8408	m570	EPPS	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
L609772	u8410	m570	WES	What do you figure it to be?
L609771	u8408	m570	EPPS	Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
L609770	u8408	m570	EPPS	Let me see the map.
L609769	u8410	m570	WES	The US Army:  Always an adventure.
L609765	u8408	m570	EPPS	Picks up again just on the other side.
L609764	u8410	m570	WES	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
L609763	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not much of a pass.
L609762	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
L609761	u8410	m570	WES	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
L609760	u8408	m570	EPPS	All we've got to do is make it to the top.
L609758	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
L609757	u8410	m570	WES	We can't just go off and--
L609756	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
L609746	u8410	m570	WES	We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
L609745	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's nothing we can do.
L609742	u8410	m570	WES	The soldiers are going to kill those people!
L609741	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  Let's get out of here.
L609692	u8410	m570	WES	Yeah.
L609691	u8408	m570	EPPS	Ready?
L609690	u8410	m570	WES	Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
L609689	u8408	m570	EPPS	You just go when I say go.
L609688	u8410	m570	WES	What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
L609676	u8408	m570	EPPS	Break it out.
L609675	u8410	m570	WES	For climbing.
L609674	u8408	m570	EPPS	We've got rope?
L609666	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
L609665	u8410	m570	WES	Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
L609664	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
L609663	u8410	m570	WES	What kind of mine?
L609631	u8408	m570	EPPS	How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
L609630	u8410	m570	WES	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
L609629	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's not so--
L609628	u8410	m570	WES	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
L609627	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
L609599	u8410	m570	WES	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
L609598	u8408	m570	EPPS	You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
L609588	u8408	m570	EPPS	Low on gas.  Got to refill.
L609587	u8410	m570	WES	What are you doing.
L609569	u8408	m570	EPPS	They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
L609568	u8410	m570	WES	Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
L609567	u8408	m570	EPPS	This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
L609566	u8410	m570	WES	We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
L609565	u8408	m570	EPPS	They shouldn't have been here.
L609541	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
L609540	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wha...
L609539	u8410	m570	WES	They stopped.
L609528	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to keep driving.
L609527	u8410	m570	WES	What are we going to do!?
L609488	u8410	m570	WES	No, please, not again.
L609487	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
L609484	u8410	m570	WES	I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
L609483	u8408	m570	EPPS	I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
L609482	u8410	m570	WES	What?
L609479	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, God.
L609478	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
L609457	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
L609456	u8410	m570	WES	You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
L609433	u8408	m570	EPPS	Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
L609432	u8410	m570	WES	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
L609431	u8408	m570	EPPS	A casual one.
L609399	u8408	m570	EPPS	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
L609398	u8410	m570	WES	It's a map, I think that's what it is.
L609395	u8408	m570	EPPS	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
L609394	u8410	m570	WES	What's it say?
L609393	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's a fortune box.
L609392	u8410	m570	WES	Paper.
L609334	u8408	m570	EPPS	Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
L609333	u8410	m570	WES	Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
L609317	u8410	m570	WES	I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
L609316	u8408	m570	EPPS	Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
L609308	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
L609307	u8410	m570	WES	...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
L609300	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
L609299	u8410	m570	WES	Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
L610246	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's going to slow down.
L610245	u8409	m570	JAEGER	He's not slowing.
L610244	u8408	m570	EPPS	He'll slow down.
L610243	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
L610241	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
L610240	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
L610239	u8408	m570	EPPS	That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
L610238	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Really?
L610237	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
L610236	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?
L610235	u8408	m570	EPPS	Australia.
L610234	u8408	m570	EPPS	How the hell should I know?
L610233	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
L610232	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.
L610231	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
L610230	u8408	m570	EPPS	Thought you were going to buy a car.
L610229	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm thinking about taking a trip.
L610228	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L610227	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps?
L610226	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
L610225	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
L610224	u8408	m570	EPPS	Threatened to blow my brains out?
L610223	u8409	m570	JAEGER	This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
L610222	u8408	m570	EPPS	Thanks.
L610221	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
L610220	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.
L610219	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps.
L610218	u8408	m570	EPPS	Then I'm a rich man.
L610217	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
L610216	u8408	m570	EPPS	Somebody has to.
L610215	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why do I have to lie in the road?
L610214	u8408	m570	EPPS	You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
L610213	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How do we do that?
L610212	u8408	m570	EPPS	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
L610211	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well?
L610210	u8408	m570	EPPS	You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
L610209	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
L610208	u8408	m570	EPPS	We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
L610207	u8409	m570	JAEGER	But...
L610206	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
L610205	u8409	m570	JAEGER	When did you make the switch?
L610204	u8408	m570	EPPS	It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
L610203	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The...the gold...
L610202	u8408	m570	EPPS	Damn it.  We lost the horses.
L610194	u8408	m570	EPPS	We go this way.
L610193	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Which way do we go!?
L610179	u8408	m570	EPPS	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
L610178	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Can you ride a horse?
L610166	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
L610165	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I didn't say that.  I never said--
L610150	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
L610149	u8408	m570	EPPS	...Wes...?
L610147	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
L610146	u8408	m570	EPPS	You come up with a better plan, let me know.
L610145	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We can't just sit here waiting to die.
L610144	u8408	m570	EPPS	With what?  Against how many?
L610143	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
L610142	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know!
L610141	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why haven't they killed us!?
L610140	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.  They killed Wes.
L610139	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Is that good, or bad?
L610138	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shi'ites, I think.
L610137	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you make of them?
L610134	u8408	m570	EPPS	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
L610133	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do we do?
L610130	u8408	m570	EPPS	Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
L610129	u8409	m570	JAEGER	To where?
L610128	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
L610127	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do we do?
L610124	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
L610123	u8408	m570	EPPS	An Iraqi?
L610119	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shoot them!
L610118	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I just said I would.  I don't think I--
L610117	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
L610116	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't have a weapon.
L610115	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Can't you--
L610114	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
L610113	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
L610112	u8408	m570	EPPS	And then shoot them.
L610111	u8409	m570	JAEGER	And then what?
L610110	u8408	m570	EPPS	Slip out your M-16.
L610109	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?
L610108	u8408	m570	EPPS	They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
L610107	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, God...
L610105	u8408	m570	EPPS	They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
L610104	u8409	m570	JAEGER	"I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means ""Don't shoot. We're your friends."""
L610103	u8408	m570	EPPS	What did you say?
L610100	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Probably.
L610099	u8408	m570	EPPS	That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
L610098	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
L610097	u8408	m570	EPPS	Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
L610096	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, I guess we should.
L610095	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, we should identify ourselves.
L610094	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well?
L610091	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
L610090	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
L610087	u8408	m570	EPPS	Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
L610086	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
L610085	u8408	m570	EPPS	Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
L610084	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you figure it is?
L610081	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
L610080	u8408	m570	EPPS	The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
L610079	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
L610078	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't you touch it.
L610077	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
L610076	u8408	m570	EPPS	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
L610075	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just let me rest for a second.
L610074	u8408	m570	EPPS	No!
L610073	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
L610072	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
L610071	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Getting cold.
L610070	u8408	m570	EPPS	Okay.  Then we go this way.
L610069	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I pick that way.
L610068	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You sure you want me too?
L610067	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
L610065	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's got to be going better than this..
L610064	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wonder how the war's going?
L610063	u8408	m570	EPPS	If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
L610062	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you think our chances are?
L610061	u8408	m570	EPPS	Damn.
L610060	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Sorry.
L610058	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
L610057	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
L610056	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
L610055	u8408	m570	EPPS	Makes two of us.
L610054	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't want to die.
L610053	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.
L610052	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps?
L610051	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?  Yeah.
L610050	u8408	m570	EPPS	You still got a map on you?
L610049	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
L610048	u8408	m570	EPPS	Sure.
L610047	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
L610046	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.  Well, me too.
L610045	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
L610043	u8408	m570	EPPS	Is it all right if I stand up?
L610042	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm sorry about that, Epps.
L610039	u8408	m570	EPPS	That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
L610038	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
L610037	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you; you've got it all together.
L610036	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
L610035	u8408	m570	EPPS	First Wes, now you?
L610031	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll search the pack.
L610030	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll lie.
L610029	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
L610028	u8408	m570	EPPS	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
L610027	u8409	m570	JAEGER	No.
L610026	u8408	m570	EPPS	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
L610025	u8409	m570	JAEGER	No.
L610019	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
L610018	u8408	m570	EPPS	What if he's not?
L610017	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wes is dead!
L610016	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't just leave him.
L610015	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Forget Wes.
L610014	u8408	m570	EPPS	We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
L610000	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll find our way!  We'll...
L609999	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How!?
L609998	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll find our way.
L609997	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
L609973	u8408	m570	EPPS	You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
L609972	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
L609971	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
L609970	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
L609969	u8408	m570	EPPS	We should head Northeast.
L609900	u8408	m570	EPPS	It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
L609899	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wes might be right about that.
L609891	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
L609890	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
L609889	u8408	m570	EPPS	What the hell took so long.
L609882	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
L609881	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
L609878	u8408	m570	EPPS	Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
L609877	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't see how that plan's any better.
L609876	u8408	m570	EPPS	Jesus, Jaeger.
L609875	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why do I have to stay down here?
L609872	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
L609871	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's not going to leave us.
L609870	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
L609869	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609868	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609867	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wait.
L609862	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
L609861	u8408	m570	EPPS	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
L609860	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
L609853	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
L609852	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Is it dead?
L609851	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's just a mongoose.
L609848	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's giving.
L609847	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
L609845	u8408	m570	EPPS	I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
L609844	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Must be a compartment.
L609840	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get up off your ass and dig!
L609839	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
L609838	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get up and dig.
L609837	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
L609836	u8408	m570	EPPS	It looks like you're not doing anything.
L609835	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?
L609834	u8408	m570	EPPS	What are you doing?
L609828	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So where do we start?
L609827	u8408	m570	EPPS	A whole lot of nothing.
L609822	u8408	m570	EPPS	Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
L609821	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think there might be more Iraqis?
L609802	u8408	m570	EPPS	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
L609801	u8409	m570	JAEGER	If they land--
L609798	u8408	m570	EPPS	They can't shoot us in here.
L609797	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're going to kill us!
L609796	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're not going to do anything.
L609795	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
L609794	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just stay down.
L609793	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where the hell is it!?
L609792	u8408	m570	EPPS	Stay low.
L609791	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where is it?  Where'd it go?
L609777	u8408	m570	EPPS	I hope it means something, otherwise...
L609776	u8409	m570	JAEGER	But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
L609775	u8408	m570	EPPS	Something like that.
L609774	u8409	m570	JAEGER	X marks the spot.
L609751	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
L609750	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
L609738	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
L609737	u8408	m570	EPPS	They're doing more than slapping.
L609733	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
L609732	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
L609731	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are they doing here?
L609730	u8408	m570	EPPS	Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
L609727	u8408	m570	EPPS	Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
L609726	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's a fire fight.
L609725	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't!
L609723	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shut up and listen!
L609722	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't hear any--
L609718	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
L609717	u8408	m570	EPPS	I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
L609714	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
L609713	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're not losing trust, are you?
L609709	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's the treasure, that's what it is.
L609708	u8408	m570	EPPS	This.  Whatever it is.
L609705	u8408	m570	EPPS	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
L609704	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
L609703	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
L609702	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're going to blow yourselves up.
L609687	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
L609686	u8408	m570	EPPS	When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
L609685	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
L609684	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're going to be fine.
L609683	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
L609682	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
L609681	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How's this going to work?
L609680	u8408	m570	EPPS	It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
L609679	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
L609678	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
L609677	u8409	m570	JAEGER	My leg is falling asleep.
L609673	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
L609672	u8408	m570	EPPS	I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
L609670	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...
L609669	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's a way.
L609662	u8408	m570	EPPS	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
L609661	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
L609660	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to be right over here.
L609659	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why you got to move away to talk!?
L609658	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
L609657	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where you going?
L609656	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
L609655	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
L609654	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just relax.
L609653	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's a mine, isn't it?
L609652	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just be cool.
L609651	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, God!  Oh God!
L609647	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I heard it.
L609646	u8408	m570	EPPS	If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
L609645	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I heard it click.
L609644	u8408	m570	EPPS	You didn't step on any mine.
L609642	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Mine.  Land mine!
L609641	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609640	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Mine.
L609639	u8408	m570	EPPS	What!?
L609622	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
L609621	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
L609620	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
L609619	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
L609618	u8408	m570	EPPS	Faster we get there, faster we get back.
L609617	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
L609616	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I got that...sir.
L609615	u8408	m570	EPPS	SAY IT!
L609604	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We leave it.
L609603	u8408	m570	EPPS	What do we do with the Humvee?
L609593	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
L609592	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
L609591	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...I know.
L609590	u8408	m570	EPPS	Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
L609582	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Millionaires, man.
L609581	u8408	m570	EPPS	It'd make their heads explode.
L609580	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
L609579	u8408	m570	EPPS	You can't tell anybody about this.
L609578	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
L609577	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609576	u8408	m570	EPPS	Let's go.
L609575	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
L609574	u8408	m570	EPPS	She okay?
L609547	u8408	m570	EPPS	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
L609546	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Steady it out!
L609538	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
L609537	u8408	m570	EPPS	Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
L609532	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's the only way.  We drive!
L609531	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're not going to--
L609530	u8408	m570	EPPS	We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
L609529	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll shoot us!
L609525	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
L609524	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
L609523	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
L609517	u8408	m570	EPPS	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
L609516	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wh-what do you think--
L609515	u8408	m570	EPPS	Take the binoculars.
L609513	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
L609512	u8409	m570	JAEGER	And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
L609511	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
L609510	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, that's fun.
L609509	u8408	m570	EPPS	Invest it.
L609508	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
L609507	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
L609504	u8408	m570	EPPS	A car?  You're going to buy a car?
L609503	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
L609502	u8408	m570	EPPS	Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
L609499	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
L609498	u8408	m570	EPPS	But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
L609481	u8408	m570	EPPS	Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
L609480	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
L609473	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Roger that.
L609472	u8408	m570	EPPS	Now this is war.
L609470	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
L609469	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
L609462	u8408	m570	EPPS	But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
L609461	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
L609460	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
L609447	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
L609446	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
L609443	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
L609442	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
L609441	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
L609440	u8408	m570	EPPS	I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
L609439	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wait.  Wait.
L609438	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
L609426	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
L609425	u8408	m570	EPPS	Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
L609424	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
L609401	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
L609400	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You think?
L609386	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I did it!  I got the box open.
L609385	u8408	m570	EPPS	What!?  What!?
L609384	u8409	m570	JAEGER	OH MY GOD!
L609383	u8408	m570	EPPS	You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
L609380	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
L609379	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
L609378	u8409	m570	JAEGER	This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
L609343	u8409	m570	JAEGER	There might be.
L609342	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
L609341	u8409	m570	JAEGER	There might be something in there.
L609340	u8408	m570	EPPS	Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
L609327	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
L609326	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
L609298	u8408	m570	EPPS	Another month in this desert and I might just.
L609297	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Blow me.
L609296	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
L609294	u8408	m570	EPPS	No you're not.
L609293	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
L609292	u8408	m570	EPPS	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
L609291	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
L609290	u8408	m570	EPPS	Knock it off!
L609289	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609282	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
L609281	u8408	m570	EPPS	What are you doing?
L609280	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
L609416	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
L609415	u8411	m570	WOODS	They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
L609414	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Some good ones.
L609413	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The photos.
L609412	u8411	m570	WOODS	Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
L609411	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just...want to be ready when we do.
L609410	u8411	m570	WOODS	Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
L609409	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I could use some recon photos too.
L609408	u8411	m570	WOODS	That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
L609405	u8411	m570	WOODS	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
L609404	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
L609403	u8411	m570	WOODS	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
L609402	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Woods.
L610156	u8410	m570	WES	You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
L610155	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
L610154	u8410	m570	WES	When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
L609988	u8410	m570	WES	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
L609987	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
L609986	u8410	m570	WES	The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
L609985	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're going to burn up in those.
L609967	u8410	m570	WES	You want to say some words?
L609966	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
L609946	u8410	m570	WES	He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
L609945	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
L609936	u8410	m570	WES	I'm not wasting my water on him.
L609935	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I think he wants something to drink.
L609934	u8410	m570	WES	All last night he could have been--
L609933	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we should give him some water.
L609927	u8409	m570	JAEGER	He lived through that?
L609926	u8410	m570	WES	Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
L609921	u8410	m570	WES	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
L609920	u8409	m570	JAEGER	With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
L609855	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I think we found something.
L609854	u8410	m570	WES	What the hell are you doing!?
L609825	u8410	m570	WES	What do you see?
L609824	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, we're down.
L609823	u8410	m570	WES	You down?
L609817	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Guess we know what the next stop is.
L609816	u8410	m570	WES	It's got a bottom.
L609812	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Lines up with the map and the photos.
L609811	u8410	m570	WES	What do you think?
L609788	u8410	m570	WES	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
L609787	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
L609767	u8410	m570	WES	We make it, or we go back empty handed.
L609766	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think we can make it?
L609755	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
L609754	u8410	m570	WES	You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
L609753	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
L609752	u8410	m570	WES	We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
L609744	u8410	m570	WES	We have to do something.
L609743	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So?
L609740	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
L609739	u8410	m570	WES	Is there anything you do know?
L609736	u8410	m570	WES	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
L609735	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
L609720	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
L609719	u8410	m570	WES	I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
L609716	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
L609715	u8410	m570	WES	If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
L609701	u8410	m570	WES	You want to crawl, crawl.
L609700	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
L609699	u8410	m570	WES	Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
L609698	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
L609697	u8410	m570	WES	How long we going to keep this up.
L609668	u8410	m570	WES	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
L609667	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...
L609610	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
L609609	u8410	m570	WES	Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
L609608	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You have to go with us, Wes.
L609607	u8410	m570	WES	You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
L609602	u8409	m570	JAEGER	As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
L609601	u8410	m570	WES	Then lets go back while we still can.
L609600	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
L609595	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
L609594	u8410	m570	WES	So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
L609561	u8410	m570	WES	We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
L609560	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
L609559	u8410	m570	WES	We have to go back.
L609558	u8410	m570	WES	We got to get out of here.
L609557	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, well, we're not.
L609556	u8410	m570	WES	I thought we were dead.
L609536	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
L609535	u8410	m570	WES	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
L609534	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah!  Yeah!
L609522	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!

L609520	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
L609519	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, God!
L609518	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Iraqis.
L609506	u8409	m570	JAEGER	A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
L609505	u8410	m570	WES	This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
L609501	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my half?
L609500	u8410	m570	WES	If there's gold.  If!
L609497	u8410	m570	WES	How the hell should I know how much?
L609496	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
L609495	u8410	m570	WES	I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
L609494	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
L609493	u8410	m570	WES	If!  If there's a treasure.
L609492	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
L609486	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, no.
L609485	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, is that a sand dune.
L609475	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
L609474	u8410	m570	WES	We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
L609468	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yes!
L609467	u8410	m570	WES	God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
L609465	u8410	m570	WES	You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
L609464	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
L609463	u8410	m570	WES	Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
L609454	u8410	m570	WES	So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
L609453	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
L609452	u8410	m570	WES	It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
L609451	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
L609450	u8410	m570	WES	You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
L609449	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
L609448	u8410	m570	WES	You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
L609436	u8409	m570	JAEGER	With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
L609435	u8410	m570	WES	What?
L609434	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We...we could go home with something else.
L609430	u8410	m570	WES	Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
L609429	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
L609390	u8410	m570	WES	It's a container.  Break the seal.
L609389	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
L609382	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
L609381	u8410	m570	WES	The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
L609376	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609375	u8410	m570	WES	This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
L609374	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609371	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
L609370	u8410	m570	WES	You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
L609369	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
L609368	u8410	m570	WES	You ever think about dying?
L609367	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What!?
L609366	u8410	m570	WES	Jaeger?
L609364	u8410	m570	WES	Why would they do all that if we weren't?
L609363	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It doesn't mean anything.
L609362	u8410	m570	WES	We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
L609361	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
L609360	u8410	m570	WES	They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
L609359	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Like I said; so?
L609358	u8410	m570	WES	That's in two days.
L609357	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  So?
L609356	u8410	m570	WES	You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
L609355	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?
L609354	u8410	m570	WES	Jaeger?
L609353	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
L609352	u8410	m570	WES	You really think there's a treasure inside?
L609351	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
L609350	u8410	m570	WES	You will.  You'll get it.
L609349	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Naw, nothing.
L609348	u8410	m570	WES	You get it yet?
L609345	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I could.
L609344	u8410	m570	WES	And you're the guy who's going to open it.
L609339	u8409	m570	JAEGER	For real?  A treasure?
L609338	u8410	m570	WES	It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
L609337	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, you're funny.
L609336	u8410	m570	WES	He says it's a box.
L609332	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
L609331	u8410	m570	WES	Now you need me.
L609330	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What is this?
L609325	u8410	m570	WES	Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
L609324	u8409	m570	JAEGER	"How do you say ""Come here, baby.  I'm horny.""  I can use that now."
L609323	u8410	m570	WES	Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
L609322	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does that mean?
L609319	u8410	m570	WES	I thought it would be good to know.
L609318	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Spanish wasn't hard enough?
L609315	u8410	m570	WES	I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
L609314	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
L609313	u8410	m570	WES	Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
L609311	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh yeah.  Accidently.
L609310	u8410	m570	WES	I'm saying don't do it accidently.
L609309	u8409	m570	JAEGER	When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
L609304	u8410	m570	WES	People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
L609303	u8409	m570	JAEGER	People are suffering.
L609302	u8410	m570	WES	I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
L609301	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
L609288	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Okay.
L609287	u8410	m570	WES	Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
L609286	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
L609285	u8410	m570	WES	Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
L609284	u8409	m570	JAEGER	A headache?
L609283	u8410	m570	WES	Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
L666463	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
L666462	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	Why don 't the Zulus attack?
L666368	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
L666367	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
L666366	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
L666365	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
L666364	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.

L666361	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	"Will you hear ""Last Post"", Sir?"
L666505	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
L666504	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
L666503	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
L666398	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
L666397	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
L666396	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
L666395	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	"If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but ""why?"" is the question my readers will ask. ""why?"""
L666394	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
L666393	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
L666392	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
L666391	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
L666390	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
L666389	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	"Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of ""The Standard"", My Lord."
L666388	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	An historical moment, Gentlemen.
L666488	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
L666487	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
L666484	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I'm explaining my reasons.
L666483	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
L666482	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
L666481	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
L666480	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
L666358	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
L666357	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
L666250	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
L666249	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
L666248	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
L666247	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
L666246	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
L666547	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	Certainly, Sin
L666546	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
L666486	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
L666485	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Yes?
L666461	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Thank you.
L666460	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
L666385	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
L666384	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	"Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from ""The Standard""."
L666383	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
L666252	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	But will they make good use of them?
L666251	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
L666502	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
L666501	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
L666500	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
L666499	u9028	m616	COGHILL	How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
L666498	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Yes.
L666497	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Stuart?
L666576	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
L666575	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
L666327	u9031	m616	MELVILL	ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
L666326	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
L666325	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Which one?
L666324	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
L666264	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
L666263	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
L666262	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
L666522	u9034	m616	VEREKER	So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
L666521	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
L666520	u9034	m616	VEREKER	Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
L666372	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
L666371	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
L666370	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
L666369	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Your orders, Mr Vereker?
L666257	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
L666256	u9034	m616	VEREKER	Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
