L36304	u306	m19	BOB	Now you tell us.
L36303	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Sometimes a wound will kill.
L36302	u306	m19	BOB	This is healing?
L35843	u306	m19	BOB	Jim Younger, I told you--
L35842	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	I couldn't lose him.
L35692	u306	m19	BOB	Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
L35691	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	I think I may just go on to the reservation.
L35643	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
L35642	u306	m19	BOB	You can ride like that?
L36521	u306	m19	BOB	It's tougher than it looks.
L36520	u308	m19	COLE	He's not bad at it.
L36519	u306	m19	BOB	"Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."""
L36427	u308	m19	COLE	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
L36426	u306	m19	BOB	I'm sorry, Cole.
L36424	u306	m19	BOB	Swear on Jimmy's grave.
L36423	u308	m19	COLE	I swear --
L36422	u306	m19	BOB	Swear.
L36421	u308	m19	COLE	Bob. I didn't...
L36420	u306	m19	BOB	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
L36419	u308	m19	COLE	I ain't done --
L36418	u306	m19	BOB	What have you done?
L36417	u308	m19	COLE	How'd they --
L36399	u308	m19	COLE	Leave me alone, Bob.
L36398	u306	m19	BOB	Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
L36397	u308	m19	COLE	As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
L36396	u306	m19	BOB	That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
L36395	u308	m19	COLE	It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
L36394	u306	m19	BOB	This is the best score yet.
L36292	u306	m19	BOB	What?
L36291	u308	m19	COLE	That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
L36177	u306	m19	BOB	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
L36176	u308	m19	COLE	We got a problem here, brother?
L36132	u306	m19	BOB	"Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."
L36131	u308	m19	COLE	How?
L36130	u306	m19	BOB	No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
L36043	u308	m19	COLE	You stay out of this, Bob.
L36042	u306	m19	BOB	Uhh, yeah it does.
L36034	u306	m19	BOB	Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
L36033	u308	m19	COLE	These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
L35966	u308	m19	COLE	I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
L35965	u306	m19	BOB	The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
L35964	u308	m19	COLE	Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
L35920	u306	m19	BOB	Zee, I'm pleased you came.
L35919	u308	m19	COLE	Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
L35747	u308	m19	COLE	That was two hours ago.
L35746	u306	m19	BOB	Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
L35663	u306	m19	BOB	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
L35662	u308	m19	COLE	Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
L35622	u308	m19	COLE	Never a good thing.
L35621	u306	m19	BOB	He's smiling.
L35590	u306	m19	BOB	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
L35589	u308	m19	COLE	Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
L35836	u306	m19	BOB	Tomorrow.
L35835	u312	m19	FRANK	The Army can hang him.
L35834	u306	m19	BOB	They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
L35833	u312	m19	FRANK	Damn!
L35830	u306	m19	BOB	He just lost his temper a little.
L35829	u312	m19	FRANK	Oh no...
L35828	u306	m19	BOB	They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
L35690	u312	m19	FRANK	Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
L35689	u306	m19	BOB	Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
L35681	u306	m19	BOB	... Will Perry ...
L35680	u312	m19	FRANK	Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
L35668	u306	m19	BOB	Then I love it.
L35667	u312	m19	FRANK	Nope.
L35666	u306	m19	BOB	Corn gonna shoot at me?
L35656	u306	m19	BOB	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
L35655	u312	m19	FRANK	Yesterday.
L35619	u312	m19	FRANK	I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
L35618	u306	m19	BOB	My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
L36276	u313	m19	JESSE	Tell me.
L36275	u306	m19	BOB	Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
L36274	u313	m19	JESSE	What?
L36273	u306	m19	BOB	He's planning a job.
L36272	u313	m19	JESSE	He's been full of vinegar lately.
L36271	u306	m19	BOB	Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
L36270	u313	m19	JESSE	You are a fine figure of a man.
L36269	u306	m19	BOB	The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
L36179	u306	m19	BOB	Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
L36178	u313	m19	JESSE	"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."
L36173	u306	m19	BOB	You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
L36172	u313	m19	JESSE	Beg pardon?
L36171	u306	m19	BOB	One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
L36170	u313	m19	JESSE	Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
L36068	u313	m19	JESSE	Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars.
L36067	u306	m19	BOB	Hey!
L36066	u313	m19	JESSE	The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk.
L36037	u313	m19	JESSE	We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
L36036	u306	m19	BOB	Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
L36035	u313	m19	JESSE	All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
L35973	u313	m19	JESSE	Exactly.
L35972	u306	m19	BOB	But if we take their money and supplies...
L35924	u306	m19	BOB	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
L35923	u313	m19	JESSE	You have no shame.
L35832	u306	m19	BOB	Two.
L35831	u313	m19	JESSE	How many of them did he kill?
L35659	u306	m19	BOB	Best damn plan I heard all war.
L35658	u313	m19	JESSE	Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
L36486	u313	m19	JESSE	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
L36485	u307	m19	BURLY DETECTIVE	You shut up now, boy.
L36484	u313	m19	JESSE	I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
L36483	u307	m19	BURLY DETECTIVE	How?
L36482	u313	m19	JESSE	I think I recognize you.
L36481	u307	m19	BURLY DETECTIVE	What you sayin' boy?
L36480	u313	m19	JESSE	You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
L36479	u307	m19	BURLY DETECTIVE	What?
L36523	u308	m19	COLE	We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
L36522	u313	m19	JESSE	Where'd you get all these riders?
L36518	u313	m19	JESSE	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
L36517	u308	m19	COLE	You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
L36516	u313	m19	JESSE	Missed you too, cousin.
L36515	u308	m19	COLE	Missed you, cousin.
L36353	u313	m19	JESSE	Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
L36352	u308	m19	COLE	WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
L36351	u313	m19	JESSE	I'm out.
L36350	u308	m19	COLE	We'll make them pay for this.
L36335	u313	m19	JESSE	Pass me some whisky.
L36334	u308	m19	COLE	Bob, rip up some bandages.
L36331	u308	m19	COLE	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
L36330	u313	m19	JESSE	Okay, you're gonna rest here.
L36320	u313	m19	JESSE	A trap.
L36319	u308	m19	COLE	Dammit!
L36314	u308	m19	COLE	You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
L36313	u313	m19	JESSE	Fine. We hit this bank.
L36312	u308	m19	COLE	Then let me run the show, General Lee.
L36311	u313	m19	JESSE	Still smells fishy.
L36307	u313	m19	JESSE	And I'm the better outlaw.
L36306	u308	m19	COLE	I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
L36300	u308	m19	COLE	That's it.
L36299	u313	m19	JESSE	And almost got hanged in peacetime.
L36298	u308	m19	COLE	I got us through the War all right.
L36297	u313	m19	JESSE	A bad idea.
L36296	u308	m19	COLE	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
L36295	u313	m19	JESSE	Beautiful.
L36284	u313	m19	JESSE	You're forgetting who's in charge --
L36283	u308	m19	COLE	I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
L36282	u313	m19	JESSE	What are you saying?
L36281	u308	m19	COLE	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
L36280	u313	m19	JESSE	Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
L36278	u313	m19	JESSE	What will be?
L36277	u308	m19	COLE	It'll be the biggest score yet.
L36181	u313	m19	JESSE	Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
L36180	u308	m19	COLE	This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
L36127	u308	m19	COLE	"Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here."
L36126	u313	m19	JESSE	Yep.
L36125	u308	m19	COLE	"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
L36124	u313	m19	JESSE	Sure, cousin.
L36123	u308	m19	COLE	Jesse, we got to have a word.
L36063	u308	m19	COLE	Twenty?!
L36062	u313	m19	JESSE	The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men.
L36057	u313	m19	JESSE	It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
L36056	u308	m19	COLE	It's not a bank.
L36041	u308	m19	COLE	Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
L36040	u313	m19	JESSE	See, Frank's being smart about this.
L36030	u308	m19	COLE	I got three.
L36029	u313	m19	JESSE	I got seven thousand.
L36001	u308	m19	COLE	Don't let it happen again.
L36000	u313	m19	JESSE	Sorry.
L35999	u308	m19	COLE	The James-Younger Gang.
L35979	u308	m19	COLE	Let's ride.
L35978	u313	m19	JESSE	Perfect, Cole.
L35977	u308	m19	COLE	I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
L35971	u313	m19	JESSE	Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
L35970	u308	m19	COLE	So what do we do, General Lee?
L35969	u313	m19	JESSE	This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
L35776	u313	m19	JESSE	Yeah.
L35775	u308	m19	COLE	Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
L35774	u313	m19	JESSE	But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
L35773	u308	m19	COLE	It was exciting.
L35772	u313	m19	JESSE	The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
L35771	u308	m19	COLE	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
L35770	u313	m19	JESSE	Thanks for the help.
L35763	u313	m19	JESSE	All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
L35762	u308	m19	COLE	She was European!
L35761	u313	m19	JESSE	She had a moustache.
L35754	u308	m19	COLE	She got two of them.
L35753	u313	m19	JESSE	You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
L35688	u313	m19	JESSE	In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
L35687	u308	m19	COLE	What is wrong with you?
L35686	u313	m19	JESSE	Not now.
L35678	u313	m19	JESSE	Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
L35677	u308	m19	COLE	You're not scared, are you?
L35676	u313	m19	JESSE	Hands off your hip, Cole.
L35665	u308	m19	COLE	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
L35664	u313	m19	JESSE	Home, boys. Back to our farms.
L35653	u313	m19	JESSE	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
L35652	u308	m19	COLE	Where you boys going?
L35646	u308	m19	COLE	Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
L35645	u313	m19	JESSE	I could use the walk.
L35644	u308	m19	COLE	Ride with me, cousin?
L35615	u313	m19	JESSE	What's going on?
L35614	u308	m19	COLE	'Bout time you got here, buddy.
L35672	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	I'm thinking...
L35671	u308	m19	COLE	Well?
L35670	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
L35669	u308	m19	COLE	Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
L35641	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	You ride like a Comanche.
L35640	u308	m19	COLE	Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
L35596	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
L35595	u308	m19	COLE	Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
L36323	u312	m19	FRANK	They're just insurance in case we run.
L36322	u308	m19	COLE	They gonna rush us?
L36321	u312	m19	FRANK	Another dozen out back.
L36287	u312	m19	FRANK	Cole, he didn't mean that.
L36286	u308	m19	COLE	Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
L36285	u312	m19	FRANK	Jesse.
L36053	u308	m19	COLE	-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
L36052	u312	m19	FRANK	Strategically.
L36051	u308	m19	COLE	Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
L35947	u312	m19	FRANK	Get buckets!
L35946	u308	m19	COLE	BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
L35768	u308	m19	COLE	Ah.
L35767	u312	m19	FRANK	Shakespeare.  He's European.
L35766	u308	m19	COLE	I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
L35760	u308	m19	COLE	Sadie was not a man!
L35759	u312	m19	FRANK	Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
L35757	u312	m19	FRANK	The brown one.
L35756	u308	m19	COLE	Which one, right or left?
L35755	u312	m19	FRANK	I think one of 'em's glass.
L35675	u312	m19	FRANK	Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
L35674	u308	m19	COLE	What the --
L35609	u312	m19	FRANK	Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
L35608	u308	m19	COLE	Both would be nice.
L35607	u312	m19	FRANK	Cannon or Gatling?
L36393	u325	m19	TELLER	All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
L36392	u308	m19	COLE	OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
L36389	u308	m19	COLE	This here is the Younger Gang!
L36388	u325	m19	TELLER	Where is Jesse James?
L36387	u308	m19	COLE	What?
L36386	u325	m19	TELLER	Of course!  Uh, sir?
L36385	u308	m19	COLE	The safe. Now.
L36147	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Me get heap firewater --
L36146	u318	m19	MARSHALL	Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
L36144	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Ho-yah!
L36143	u318	m19	MARSHALL	East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
L36142	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
L36141	u318	m19	MARSHALL	Of St. Louis?
L36140	u318	m19	MARSHALL	The District Marshall
L36139	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
L36138	u318	m19	MARSHALL	Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
L36137	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	You 'um big lawman?
L36015	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	I'd appreciate that.
L36014	u319	m19	OLD MAN	Fine. I'll just wait here.
L36013	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	It's a secret.
L36012	u319	m19	OLD MAN	Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
L36011	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	On account of we're robbing it.
L36010	u319	m19	OLD MAN	Then why can't I go in there?
L36009	u309	m19	COMANCHE TOM	You're right, sir.
L36008	u319	m19	OLD MAN	I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
L36028	u324	m19	SHERRIFF	Shit.
L36027	u310	m19	DEPUTY	I had you covered.  From back there.
L36026	u324	m19	SHERRIFF	Where the hell were you?
L36020	u324	m19	SHERRIFF	When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
L36019	u310	m19	DEPUTY	So?
L36018	u324	m19	SHERRIFF	Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
L36017	u310	m19	DEPUTY	What is it?
L36016	u324	m19	SHERRIFF	What the --
L35915	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	It's fine by me, Jesse.
L35914	u313	m19	JESSE	Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
L35913	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	You know you're welcome any time!
L35910	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
L35909	u313	m19	JESSE	What do you say, sir?
L35841	u313	m19	JESSE	Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
L35840	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	Boys...
L35710	u313	m19	JESSE	Died a hero.
L35709	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	Web died fighting?
L35706	u313	m19	JESSE	Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
L35705	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	My little Web did that?
L35704	u313	m19	JESSE	-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
L36104	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
L36103	u326	m19	ZEE	He thinks this is some kind of game!
L35877	u326	m19	ZEE	I think he's already feeling better.
L35876	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
L35875	u326	m19	ZEE	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
L35874	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	They're gone. What are you --
L35863	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
L35862	u326	m19	ZEE	He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
L35717	u311	m19	DOC MIMMS	Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
L35716	u326	m19	ZEE	Daddy, don't start with this again.
L36529	u312	m19	FRANK	Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
L36528	u313	m19	JESSE	See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
L36527	u312	m19	FRANK	I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
L36349	u312	m19	FRANK	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
L36348	u313	m19	JESSE	A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
L36347	u312	m19	FRANK	Yeah.
L36346	u313	m19	JESSE	You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
L36345	u312	m19	FRANK	Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
L36344	u313	m19	JESSE	He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
L36343	u312	m19	FRANK	Jim was old enough...
L36342	u313	m19	JESSE	Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
L36326	u312	m19	FRANK	Got any ideas, little brother?
L36325	u313	m19	JESSE	They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
L36289	u312	m19	FRANK	No, I --
L36288	u313	m19	JESSE	You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
L36212	u312	m19	FRANK	Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
L36211	u313	m19	JESSE	Oh yeah.
L36210	u312	m19	FRANK	We're drunk.
L36206	u312	m19	FRANK	A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
L36205	u313	m19	JESSE	What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
L36204	u312	m19	FRANK	Maybe it started out that way. But now...
L36203	u313	m19	JESSE	We're doing this for Ma.
L36202	u312	m19	FRANK	I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
L36201	u313	m19	JESSE	That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
L36200	u312	m19	FRANK	If I could go back to farming --
L36199	u313	m19	JESSE	You've killed your fair share of men.
L36198	u312	m19	FRANK	It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
L36197	u313	m19	JESSE	And we're good at it.
L36196	u312	m19	FRANK	Jesse, we're outlaws.
L36195	u313	m19	JESSE	This has been a good year.
L36188	u313	m19	JESSE	Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
L36187	u312	m19	FRANK	Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
L36184	u312	m19	FRANK	The posters?
L36183	u313	m19	JESSE	Bob's upset.
L36182	u312	m19	FRANK	Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
L36112	u312	m19	FRANK	It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
L36111	u313	m19	JESSE	I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
L36059	u313	m19	JESSE	And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
L36058	u312	m19	FRANK	And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
L36047	u312	m19	FRANK	And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
L36046	u313	m19	JESSE	And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
L36023	u312	m19	FRANK	We're gonna have to talk...
L36022	u313	m19	JESSE	Fine. How'd it go out here?
L36021	u312	m19	FRANK	How'd it go in there?
L35963	u313	m19	JESSE	Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
L35962	u312	m19	FRANK	Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
L35961	u313	m19	JESSE	Don't care.
L35960	u312	m19	FRANK	... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
L35949	u313	m19	JESSE	Ma.
L35948	u312	m19	FRANK	Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
L35912	u313	m19	JESSE	Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
L35911	u312	m19	FRANK	You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
L35908	u312	m19	FRANK	Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
L35907	u313	m19	JESSE	What do you think?
L35906	u312	m19	FRANK	You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
L35811	u313	m19	JESSE	Damn. All that reading paid off.
L35810	u312	m19	FRANK	I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
L35784	u313	m19	JESSE	Heard of him.
L35783	u312	m19	FRANK	You know him?
L35765	u312	m19	FRANK	"Your Zee? Hmm.  ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."""
L35764	u313	m19	JESSE	-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
L35752	u313	m19	JESSE	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
L35751	u312	m19	FRANK	She's still talking to Jesus.
L35735	u312	m19	FRANK	"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
L35734	u313	m19	JESSE	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
L35733	u312	m19	FRANK	You are a charmer.
L35732	u313	m19	JESSE	You can shut up now.
L35731	u312	m19	FRANK	Big and older?
L35725	u312	m19	FRANK	Maybe, maybe...
L35724	u313	m19	JESSE	That just might work.
L35722	u313	m19	JESSE	What kind of story are they going to believe?
L35721	u312	m19	FRANK	Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
L35720	u313	m19	JESSE	All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
L35708	u313	m19	JESSE	Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
L35707	u312	m19	FRANK	Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
L35702	u313	m19	JESSE	Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
L35701	u312	m19	FRANK	You're doing just fine.
L35700	u313	m19	JESSE	Frank, don't you have something to say?
L35684	u312	m19	FRANK	We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
L35683	u313	m19	JESSE	Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
L35661	u313	m19	JESSE	All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
L35660	u312	m19	FRANK	Hello, Liberty Missoura!
L35651	u312	m19	FRANK	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
L35650	u313	m19	JESSE	Hell of a war.
L35649	u312	m19	FRANK	I reckoned.
L35648	u313	m19	JESSE	Web's dead.
L35639	u312	m19	FRANK	No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
L35638	u313	m19	JESSE	See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
L35637	u312	m19	FRANK	I figure.
L35636	u313	m19	JESSE	That would have made an impression.
L35635	u312	m19	FRANK	You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
L35634	u313	m19	JESSE	Such as?
L35633	u312	m19	FRANK	Mm-hmm.
L35632	u313	m19	JESSE	So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
L35631	u312	m19	FRANK	Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
L35630	u313	m19	JESSE	Distracting enough for you?
L35617	u313	m19	JESSE	So we got a plan?
L35616	u312	m19	FRANK	Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
L36550	u312	m19	FRANK	Everything but the boring parts.
L36549	u315	m19	JIMMY	How much of that story is true?
L36548	u312	m19	FRANK	Yeah Jimmy?
L36547	u315	m19	JIMMY	Uncle Frank?
L36545	u312	m19	FRANK	I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
L36544	u315	m19	JIMMY	So what was he?
L36543	u312	m19	FRANK	Can't argue that.
L36542	u315	m19	JIMMY	But he killed a lot of men, too.
L36541	u312	m19	FRANK	Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
L36540	u315	m19	JIMMY	They're making him a hero now.
L36539	u312	m19	FRANK	That he was.
L36538	u315	m19	JIMMY	Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
L36537	u312	m19	FRANK	Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
L36536	u312	m19	FRANK	I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
L36535	u315	m19	JIMMY	...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
L36534	u312	m19	FRANK	Yeah, Jimmy?
L36533	u315	m19	JIMMY	Y'know, Uncle Frank...
L35958	u317	m19	MA	Shush.
L35957	u313	m19	JESSE	Doc Mimms will --
L35956	u317	m19	MA	Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
L35955	u313	m19	JESSE	We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
L35954	u317	m19	MA	Riders --
L35952	u317	m19	MA	Boys?
L35951	u313	m19	JESSE	Ma! Please!
L35804	u313	m19	JESSE	Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
L35803	u317	m19	MA	The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
L35780	u317	m19	MA	We're just fine, thank you, sir.
L35779	u313	m19	JESSE	Easterners.
L35750	u317	m19	MA	He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
L35749	u313	m19	JESSE	Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
L35741	u317	m19	MA	Say your prayers?
L35740	u313	m19	JESSE	A fair number, Ma.
L35739	u317	m19	MA	Did you kill Yankees?
L36532	u313	m19	JESSE	I'll explain on the way.
L36531	u326	m19	ZEE	Tennessee?
L36514	u313	m19	JESSE	Yes ma'am.
L36513	u326	m19	ZEE	Don't swear.
L36512	u313	m19	JESSE	You are a hell of a woman.
L36511	u326	m19	ZEE	I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
L36510	u313	m19	JESSE	Yes ma'am.
L36509	u326	m19	ZEE	You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
L36414	u326	m19	ZEE	If you don't see it, it's not real...
L36413	u313	m19	JESSE	What?
L36412	u326	m19	ZEE	Don't turn around.
L36411	u313	m19	JESSE	Swimming. Swimming is good.
L36410	u326	m19	ZEE	Stop it. This is just sad.
L36409	u313	m19	JESSE	Aw, shucks, ma'am...
L36408	u326	m19	ZEE	Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
L36407	u313	m19	JESSE	Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
L36406	u326	m19	ZEE	"Oh, I'm not finished.  ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple.""  As I said. Hmm."
L36405	u313	m19	JESSE	Let me see that.
L36404	u326	m19	ZEE	Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James. Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
L36403	u313	m19	JESSE	I beg your pardon?
L36402	u326	m19	ZEE	But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James.
L36401	u313	m19	JESSE	Hmm what?
L36400	u326	m19	ZEE	Hmm.
L36370	u326	m19	ZEE	Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
L36369	u313	m19	JESSE	I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
L36368	u326	m19	ZEE	Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
L36367	u313	m19	JESSE	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
L36366	u326	m19	ZEE	I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
L36364	u313	m19	JESSE	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
L36363	u326	m19	ZEE	That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
L36362	u313	m19	JESSE	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
L36361	u326	m19	ZEE	I don't understand.
L36360	u313	m19	JESSE	I had to see you. I'm getting married.
L36359	u326	m19	ZEE	Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
L36358	u313	m19	JESSE	Zee.
L35987	u313	m19	JESSE	When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
L35986	u326	m19	ZEE	Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
L35985	u313	m19	JESSE	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
L35984	u326	m19	ZEE	Let the law --
L35983	u313	m19	JESSE	Me neither.
L35982	u326	m19	ZEE	You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
L35981	u313	m19	JESSE	Frank and me have to go away for a while.
L35980	u326	m19	ZEE	I am so sorry, Jesse.
L35945	u313	m19	JESSE	I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
L35944	u326	m19	ZEE	Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
L35943	u313	m19	JESSE	Yep.
L35942	u326	m19	ZEE	Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
L35941	u313	m19	JESSE	Little ones.
L35940	u326	m19	ZEE	Sparkling rocks?
L35939	u313	m19	JESSE	"Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."""
L35937	u313	m19	JESSE	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
L35936	u326	m19	ZEE	Where will you find such a girl?
L35935	u313	m19	JESSE	Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
L35934	u326	m19	ZEE	And what's this right girl like?
L35933	u313	m19	JESSE	Not if I find the right girl.
L35932	u326	m19	ZEE	You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
L35931	u313	m19	JESSE	Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
L35930	u326	m19	ZEE	Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
L35929	u313	m19	JESSE	Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
L35928	u326	m19	ZEE	A river pirate.
L35927	u313	m19	JESSE	I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
L35926	u326	m19	ZEE	You didn't want to farm?
L35925	u313	m19	JESSE	I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
L35905	u313	m19	JESSE	Unfair. You are completely unfair.
L35904	u326	m19	ZEE	So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
L35903	u313	m19	JESSE	I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
L35902	u326	m19	ZEE	Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
L35901	u313	m19	JESSE	What?
L35900	u326	m19	ZEE	I shouldn't tease a hero.
L35899	u313	m19	JESSE	What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
L35898	u326	m19	ZEE	Teasing you is completely unfair.
L35897	u313	m19	JESSE	No! I mean, of course not. No.
L35896	u326	m19	ZEE	You're sick of my company?
L35895	u313	m19	JESSE	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
L35894	u326	m19	ZEE	You shouldn't be up.
L35873	u313	m19	JESSE	Nuh-huh ...
L35872	u326	m19	ZEE	Jesse, is that your hand?
L35871	u313	m19	JESSE	Mmmm.
L35870	u326	m19	ZEE	Jesse, are you awake?
L35712	u313	m19	JESSE	If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
L35711	u326	m19	ZEE	But still died.
L35697	u313	m19	JESSE	But you got big!
L35696	u326	m19	ZEE	You were little Jesse James when you left.
L35695	u313	m19	JESSE	Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
L36508	u313	m19	JESSE	Fair enough.
L36507	u322	m19	PINKERTON	I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
L36506	u313	m19	JESSE	Thanks.
L36505	u322	m19	PINKERTON	The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
L36499	u322	m19	PINKERTON	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
L36498	u313	m19	JESSE	That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
L36457	u322	m19	PINKERTON	No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
L36456	u313	m19	JESSE	Ahh, you'll miss me.
L36455	u322	m19	PINKERTON	You cocky little bastard.
L36454	u313	m19	JESSE	I'm not hanged yet.
L36453	u322	m19	PINKERTON	That's what I would have done.
L36452	u313	m19	JESSE	Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
L36451	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Was it worth it?
L36450	u313	m19	JESSE	I figured.
L36449	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
L36448	u313	m19	JESSE	No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
L36447	u322	m19	PINKERTON	I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
L36446	u313	m19	JESSE	Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
L36445	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Damn.
L36444	u313	m19	JESSE	The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
L36443	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Yes?
L36442	u313	m19	JESSE	You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
L36441	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Mmm.
L36440	u313	m19	JESSE	Last February?
L36439	u322	m19	PINKERTON	How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
L36438	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Pity.
L36437	u313	m19	JESSE	You almost ended my career before it began.
L36435	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
L36434	u313	m19	JESSE	Did you order our houses burned down?
L36433	u322	m19	PINKERTON	That's the idea.
L36432	u313	m19	JESSE	So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
L36431	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
L36430	u313	m19	JESSE	But I like the presidential suite.
L36429	u322	m19	PINKERTON	We're moving you tomorrow.
L36383	u321	m19	PASTOR	Communion.
L36382	u313	m19	JESSE	Right here in church?
L36381	u321	m19	PASTOR	Now let's have a drink.
L36380	u321	m19	PASTOR	Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
L36379	u313	m19	JESSE	Thank you.
L36378	u321	m19	PASTOR	Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
L36377	u313	m19	JESSE	I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
L36376	u321	m19	PASTOR	"The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  ""Jesse Woodson James."" Jesse James? The Jesse James?"
L36375	u313	m19	JESSE	You don't think God'll mind, do you?
L36374	u321	m19	PASTOR	This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
L36339	u313	m19	JESSE	You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
L36338	u314	m19	JIM	Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
L36337	u313	m19	JESSE	This time we'll make an exception.
L36336	u314	m19	JIM	... too young for whisky...
L36310	u314	m19	JIM	It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
L36309	u313	m19	JESSE	What about that Rock Island bastard?
L36227	u313	m19	JESSE	You do that.
L36226	u314	m19	JIM	Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
L36225	u313	m19	JESSE	I swear.
L36224	u314	m19	JIM	You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
L36223	u313	m19	JESSE	I think so.
L36222	u314	m19	JIM	Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
L36221	u313	m19	JESSE	You been with a girl ever?
L36220	u314	m19	JIM	Well, not exactly.
L36219	u314	m19	JIM	Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
L36218	u313	m19	JESSE	Jim, you been with a girl yet?
L36217	u314	m19	JIM	I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
L36216	u313	m19	JESSE	I guess so.
L36215	u314	m19	JIM	Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
L36214	u313	m19	JESSE	Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
L36213	u314	m19	JIM	You okay, Jesse?
L35968	u313	m19	JESSE	No.
L35967	u314	m19	JIM	I like that.
L35848	u313	m19	JESSE	And the same age Web was. No.
L35847	u314	m19	JIM	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
L35846	u313	m19	JESSE	And you're too young.
L36245	u314	m19	JIM	Don't talk about it much, though.
L36244	u316	m19	LYLA	Really?
L36243	u314	m19	JIM	Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
L36242	u316	m19	LYLA	That is so gentlemanly of you.
L36241	u314	m19	JIM	Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
L36240	u316	m19	LYLA	Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
L36239	u314	m19	JIM	Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
L36238	u316	m19	LYLA	Lyla Devereux.
L36237	u314	m19	JIM	Thank you, Miss -- ?
L36236	u316	m19	LYLA	I just though you were awful cute.
L36235	u314	m19	JIM	Not at all.
L36234	u316	m19	LYLA	I hope I'm not being too forward.
L36233	u314	m19	JIM	Really?
L36232	u316	m19	LYLA	Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
L36231	u314	m19	JIM	Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
L36230	u316	m19	LYLA	I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
L36229	u314	m19	JIM	Why, yeah.
L36496	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Move you fools!
L36495	u320	m19	PARKER	There's only four of them...
L36158	u322	m19	PINKERTON	They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
L36157	u320	m19	PARKER	How can that be?
L36090	u322	m19	PINKERTON	By burning down their homes?
L36089	u320	m19	PARKER	They had to be dealt with!
L36088	u322	m19	PINKERTON	My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
L35858	u322	m19	PINKERTON	It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
L35857	u320	m19	PARKER	Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
L35795	u320	m19	PARKER	I'm doing you folks a favor --
L35794	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Well, this land is about to be condemned.
L36462	u323	m19	RAINS	Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
L36461	u320	m19	PARKER	How did you know?
L36459	u320	m19	PARKER	I remember you.
L36458	u323	m19	RAINS	This is him.
L36253	u320	m19	PARKER	Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
L36252	u323	m19	RAINS	That.
L36251	u320	m19	PARKER	What, sir?
L36250	u323	m19	RAINS	What is that?
L36249	u320	m19	PARKER	Sir?
L36248	u323	m19	RAINS	Parker.
L36247	u323	m19	RAINS	I look forward to seeing it.
L36246	u320	m19	PARKER	The final route for the railroad is complete.
L36160	u320	m19	PARKER	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
L36159	u323	m19	RAINS	With my money!
L36087	u323	m19	RAINS	What is going on here, man?
L36086	u320	m19	PARKER	Your men knew the risks.
L36081	u320	m19	PARKER	We did.
L36080	u323	m19	RAINS	THEN WHO DID?!
L36079	u320	m19	PARKER	To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
L36078	u323	m19	RAINS	I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
L36077	u320	m19	PARKER	Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
L36076	u323	m19	RAINS	How much did they get from the safe?
L36075	u320	m19	PARKER	They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
L35893	u323	m19	RAINS	I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
L35892	u320	m19	PARKER	I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
L35891	u323	m19	RAINS	You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
L35890	u320	m19	PARKER	A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
L35889	u323	m19	RAINS	Just perfect.
L35888	u320	m19	PARKER	Yes sir.
L35887	u323	m19	RAINS	Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
L35886	u320	m19	PARKER	Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
L35885	u323	m19	RAINS	Good.
L35884	u320	m19	PARKER	Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
L35883	u323	m19	RAINS	Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
L35882	u320	m19	PARKER	I can completely understand your distress, sir.
L35881	u323	m19	RAINS	NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
L35880	u320	m19	PARKER	Really!
L35879	u323	m19	RAINS	And it is my pleasure to be here.
L35878	u320	m19	PARKER	Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
L36491	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Vengeance.
L36490	u323	m19	RAINS	What the hell is that sound?
L36267	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
L36266	u323	m19	RAINS	What is that?
L36265	u322	m19	PINKERTON	No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
L36264	u323	m19	RAINS	Can you put men at all four?
L36263	u322	m19	PINKERTON	There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
L36262	u323	m19	RAINS	In English, Pinkerton.
L36261	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
L36260	u322	m19	PINKERTON	No.
L36259	u323	m19	RAINS	So he's won.
L36165	u322	m19	PINKERTON	It's going to be a long spring.
L36164	u323	m19	RAINS	Can't you tell me anything?
L36163	u322	m19	PINKERTON	No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
L36162	u323	m19	RAINS	I demand action.
L36161	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
L36156	u322	m19	PINKERTON	And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
L36155	u323	m19	RAINS	I can't believe this.
L36154	u322	m19	PINKERTON	First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
L36152	u322	m19	PINKERTON	All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
L36151	u323	m19	RAINS	Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
L36120	u322	m19	PINKERTON	It's going to be a long winter.
L36119	u323	m19	RAINS	So you can't tell me anything?
L36118	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
L36117	u323	m19	RAINS	I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
L36116	u322	m19	PINKERTON	It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
L36100	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Oh, that's the best part.
L36099	u323	m19	RAINS	The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
L36098	u322	m19	PINKERTON	It is a nice piece of writing.
L36097	u323	m19	RAINS	A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West.
L36096	u322	m19	PINKERTON	I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
L36095	u323	m19	RAINS	This is no game.
L36094	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
L36093	u323	m19	RAINS	I want them arrested and hanged!
L36092	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
L36091	u323	m19	RAINS	You wouldn't have done that?
L36085	u322	m19	PINKERTON	Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
L36084	u323	m19	RAINS	Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
L195536	u872	m56	CHINK	That's your problem.
L195535	u877	m56	SISSY	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
L195534	u872	m56	CHINK	Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
L195533	u872	m56	CHINK	The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
L195532	u877	m56	SISSY	Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
L195529	u872	m56	CHINK	Easy come, easy go.
L195528	u877	m56	SISSY	But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
L195527	u872	m56	CHINK	You mean she's dead?
L195526	u877	m56	SISSY	She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
L195525	u872	m56	CHINK	I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
L195524	u877	m56	SISSY	The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
L195523	u872	m56	CHINK	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
L195522	u877	m56	SISSY	Is everything getting worse?
L195433	u872	m56	CHINK	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
L195432	u877	m56	SISSY	What do you believe in then?
L195428	u872	m56	CHINK	"The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled ""Indians"" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that ""Indians"" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906."
L195427	u877	m56	SISSY	Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
L195426	u872	m56	CHINK	During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
L195425	u877	m56	SISSY	The Clock People?
L195424	u872	m56	CHINK	But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
L195423	u872	m56	CHINK	He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
L195422	u877	m56	SISSY	Siwash, huh?
L195421	u872	m56	CHINK	The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
L195420	u877	m56	SISSY	Clockworks?
L195419	u872	m56	CHINK	Clockworks.
L195418	u877	m56	SISSY	What was that?
L195416	u872	m56	CHINK	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
L195415	u877	m56	SISSY	But I don't know how to polka.
L195412	u872	m56	CHINK	Save your breath for the climb.
L195411	u877	m56	SISSY	Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
L195410	u872	m56	CHINK	I know who you are.
L195409	u877	m56	SISSY	I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
L195277	u873	m56	HOWARD	Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
L195276	u877	m56	SISSY	Where are the others?
L195265	u877	m56	SISSY	You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
L195264	u873	m56	HOWARD	A traveler, eh?
L195263	u877	m56	SISSY	Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
L195262	u873	m56	HOWARD	You don't?
L195261	u877	m56	SISSY	I don't.
L195260	u873	m56	HOWARD	I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
L195259	u877	m56	SISSY	I'm staying with the Countess.
L195258	u873	m56	HOWARD	Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
L195496	u877	m56	SISSY	If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
L195495	u874	m56	JELLY	Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
L195489	u877	m56	SISSY	But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
L195488	u874	m56	JELLY	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
L195487	u877	m56	SISSY	No, I guess not.
L195481	u877	m56	SISSY	How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
L195480	u874	m56	JELLY	Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
L195479	u877	m56	SISSY	So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
L195478	u874	m56	JELLY	Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
L195467	u874	m56	JELLY	FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
L195466	u877	m56	SISSY	That's Jellybean!
L195388	u874	m56	JELLY	I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
L195387	u877	m56	SISSY	You don't agree with Debbie, then?
L195386	u874	m56	JELLY	Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
L195385	u877	m56	SISSY	What is Debbie's position?
L195384	u874	m56	JELLY	......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
L195372	u874	m56	JELLY	Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
L195371	u877	m56	SISSY	Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
L195370	u874	m56	JELLY	Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
L195369	u874	m56	JELLY	"No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. ""Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."""
L195368	u877	m56	SISSY	You're political, then?
L195367	u874	m56	JELLY	Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
L195366	u877	m56	SISSY	About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
L195365	u874	m56	JELLY	About...
L195364	u877	m56	SISSY	Tell me about it.
L195363	u874	m56	JELLY	Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
L195362	u877	m56	SISSY	No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
L195361	u874	m56	JELLY	Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
L195360	u877	m56	SISSY	Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
L195359	u874	m56	JELLY	Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
L195322	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
L195321	u875	m56	JULIAN	What guy?
L195320	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
L195319	u875	m56	JULIAN	If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
L195318	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
L195317	u875	m56	JULIAN	I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
L195316	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Whose fault was that?
L195315	u875	m56	JULIAN	Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
L195314	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
L195313	u875	m56	JULIAN	Well.... er...
L195312	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	What do you think?
L195311	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Like what?
L195310	u875	m56	JULIAN	How does she like what in bed?
L195309	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
L195308	u875	m56	JULIAN	I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
L195307	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
L195306	u875	m56	JULIAN	Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
L195305	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
L195304	u875	m56	JULIAN	Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
L195303	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
L195302	u875	m56	JULIAN	Extraordinary!
L195299	u877	m56	SISSY	My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
L195298	u875	m56	JULIAN	Why? Why do you have to go?
L195297	u877	m56	SISSY	I have to go, Julian.
L195296	u875	m56	JULIAN	But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
L195295	u877	m56	SISSY	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
L195294	u875	m56	JULIAN	What are you doing?
L195293	u877	m56	SISSY	It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
L195292	u875	m56	JULIAN	Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
L195291	u877	m56	SISSY	I'm cold.
L195196	u877	m56	SISSY	As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
L195195	u876	m56	MAN	Whooee!
L195194	u877	m56	SISSY	When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
L195193	u876	m56	MAN	You're the best?
L195192	u877	m56	SISSY	I'm the best.
L195191	u876	m56	MAN	Hitchhiking?
L195190	u877	m56	SISSY	Yep.
L195189	u876	m56	MAN	So now you're bummin' around?
L195188	u877	m56	SISSY	I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
L195187	u876	m56	MAN	For magazines?
L195186	u877	m56	SISSY	I was a successful model once.
L195185	u876	m56	MAN	Are you in show business?
L195184	u877	m56	SISSY	American Cheese. The king of road food.
L195183	u876	m56	MAN	Thanks.
L195182	u876	m56	MAN	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
L195181	u877	m56	SISSY	Going north?
L195437	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
L195436	u877	m56	SISSY	I don't know anything about it.
L195435	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
L195233	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
L195232	u877	m56	SISSY	Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
L195231	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
L195230	u877	m56	SISSY	What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
L195229	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
L195228	u877	m56	SISSY	Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
L195227	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
L195226	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
L195225	u877	m56	SISSY	But Countess...
L195224	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
L195223	u877	m56	SISSY	If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
L195222	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
L195221	u877	m56	SISSY	The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
L195220	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
L195219	u877	m56	SISSY	A job for me?
L195218	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
L195217	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
L195216	u877	m56	SISSY	Your ranch?
L195215	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
L195214	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
L195213	u877	m56	SISSY	Bonanza Jellybean?
L195212	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
L195211	u877	m56	SISSY	Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
L195210	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
L195209	u877	m56	SISSY	I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
L195208	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
L195207	u877	m56	SISSY	A born freak can only go uphill.
L195206	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
L195205	u877	m56	SISSY	Tired...
L195204	u878	m56	THE COUNTESS	To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
L422325	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
L422324	u2350	m151	BELL	I'm... discouraged.
L422323	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You're discouraged.
L422322	u2350	m151	BELL	Most don't.
L422321	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
L422320	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
L422319	u2350	m151	BELL	No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
L422318	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Nineteen zero and nine.
L422317	u2350	m151	BELL	When did he die?
L422316	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
L422314	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes I do.
L422313	u2355	m151	ELLIS	You don't know what he thinks.
L422312	u2350	m151	BELL	...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
L422311	u2350	m151	BELL	I don't know. I feel overmatched.
L422310	u2355	m151	ELLIS	How come're you doin that?
L422309	u2350	m151	BELL	Yes, you've circled round.
L422308	u2355	m151	ELLIS	...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
L422307	u2355	m151	ELLIS	All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
L422306	u2350	m151	BELL	I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
L422305	u2355	m151	ELLIS	I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
L422304	u2350	m151	BELL	What would you a done if he'd been released?
L422303	u2355	m151	ELLIS	In Angola. Yeah.
L422302	u2350	m151	BELL	That man that shot you died in prison.
L422301	u2355	m151	ELLIS	I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
L422300	u2350	m151	BELL	How fresh is this coffee?
L422299	u2355	m151	ELLIS	'Predate it.
L422298	u2350	m151	BELL	Want a cup?
L422297	u2355	m151	ELLIS	She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
L422296	u2350	m151	BELL	Didn't know there was any.
L422295	u2355	m151	ELLIS	Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.

L421686	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.

L421673	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.

L421664	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Sir?
L421663	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
L421662	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
L421661	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	...If that's the way you wanna put it.

L421633	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	Will there be anything else?
L421632	u2352	m151	CHIGURH	Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
L421631	u2363	m151	PROPRIETOR	With anything?

L421928	u2365	m151	WELLS	Okay. We can stop that.
L421927	u2357	m151	MAN	He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
L421925	u2357	m151	MAN	I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
L421924	u2365	m151	WELLS	What do you want to know?
L421923	u2357	m151	MAN	That's not an answer.
L421922	u2365	m151	WELLS	Well enough.
L421921	u2357	m151	MAN	How well do you know Chigurh.
L421920	u2365	m151	WELLS	Okay.
L421919	u2357	m151	MAN	If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
L421918	u2365	m151	WELLS	Yessir.
L421916	u2365	m151	WELLS	Yessir. I understand that.
L421915	u2357	m151	MAN	We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
L421914	u2365	m151	WELLS	No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
L421913	u2357	m151	MAN	You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
L421912	u2365	m151	WELLS	November the 28th, last year.
L421911	u2357	m151	MAN	When did you last see him.
L421910	u2365	m151	WELLS	Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
L422241	u2367	m151	WOMAN	I do like you.
L422240	u2360	m151	MOSS	Then you'll like me.
L422239	u2367	m151	WOMAN	Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
L422238	u2360	m151	MOSS	Lookin' for what's comin'.
L422237	u2367	m151	WOMAN	What else then?
L422236	u2360	m151	MOSS	Half.
L422235	u2367	m151	WOMAN	Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
L422234	u2360	m151	MOSS	Waitin' for my wife.
L422233	u2367	m151	WOMAN	I got beers in my room.
L422232	u2360	m151	MOSS	That's me.
L421901	u2367	m151	WOMAN	That's got two double beds.
L421900	u2360	m151	MOSS	No, one forty-two.
L421899	u2367	m151	WOMAN	You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
L421898	u2360	m151	MOSS	What about one forty-two.
L421896	u2360	m151	MOSS	Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
L421895	u2367	m151	WOMAN	Another additional.
L421894	u2360	m151	MOSS	No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
L421893	u2367	m151	WOMAN	You want to change rooms?
L421892	u2360	m151	MOSS	Could I get another room.
L421836	u2360	m151	MOSS	I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
L421835	u2367	m151	WOMAN	...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
L421834	u2367	m151	WOMAN	The option.
L421833	u2360	m151	MOSS	The what?
L421832	u2367	m151	WOMAN	You tell me the option.
L422037	u2360	m151	MOSS	He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
L422036	u2365	m151	WELLS	No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
L422035	u2360	m151	MOSS	If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
L422034	u2365	m151	WELLS	...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
L422033	u2365	m151	WELLS	No. You don't.
L422032	u2360	m151	MOSS	No I don't have it.
L422031	u2365	m151	WELLS	The heroin. You don't have it.
L422030	u2360	m151	MOSS	What product.
L422029	u2365	m151	WELLS	...You didn't take the product, did you?
L422028	u2365	m151	WELLS	He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
L422027	u2360	m151	MOSS	Maybe he should be worried. About me.
L422026	u2365	m151	WELLS	To kill your wife.
L422025	u2360	m151	MOSS	Why would he go to Odessa?
L422023	u2360	m151	MOSS	Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
L422022	u2365	m151	WELLS	Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
L422021	u2360	m151	MOSS	So what does that make me? Your buddy?
L422020	u2365	m151	WELLS	So was I.
L422019	u2360	m151	MOSS	Yeah. I was in Nam.
L422018	u2365	m151	WELLS	Were you in Nam?
L422017	u2360	m151	MOSS	What did I say?
L422016	u2365	m151	WELLS	Pot metal?
L422015	u2360	m151	MOSS	I didn't say braze.
L422014	u2365	m151	WELLS	I don't mean braze.
L422013	u2360	m151	MOSS	Yes.
L422012	u2365	m151	WELLS	Cast iron?
L422011	u2360	m151	MOSS	Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
L422010	u2365	m151	WELLS	Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
L422009	u2360	m151	MOSS	I'm a welder.
L422008	u2365	m151	WELLS	What did you do?
L422007	u2360	m151	MOSS	I'm retired.
L422006	u2365	m151	WELLS	...What do you do?
L422005	u2365	m151	WELLS	No. You don't understand.
L422004	u2360	m151	MOSS	I been immobile.
L422003	u2365	m151	WELLS	Took me about three hours.
L422002	u2360	m151	MOSS	Not any way.
L422001	u2365	m151	WELLS	Not that way.
L422000	u2360	m151	MOSS	I know what it is. He won't find me again.
L421999	u2365	m151	WELLS	It's called a transponder.
L421998	u2360	m151	MOSS	I know how he found me.
L421997	u2365	m151	WELLS	Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
L421996	u2360	m151	MOSS	Sugar?
L421995	u2365	m151	WELLS	I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
L421994	u2360	m151	MOSS	How would you describe him?
L421993	u2365	m151	WELLS	I don't think that's how I would describe him.
L421992	u2360	m151	MOSS	What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
L421991	u2365	m151	WELLS	...But that won't last.
L421989	u2360	m151	MOSS	I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
L421988	u2365	m151	WELLS	...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
L422142	u2360	m151	MOSS	Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
L422141	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	What outfit.
L422140	u2360	m151	MOSS	Yes sir. Two tours.
L422139	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Nam?
L422138	u2360	m151	MOSS	No sir. I'm a veteran.
L422137	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Are you in the service?
L422136	u2360	m151	MOSS	Yes sir.
L422135	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Don't jack with me.
L422134	u2360	m151	MOSS	No sir.
L422133	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Are you jackin' with me?
L422132	u2360	m151	MOSS	I got an overcoat on.
L422131	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
L422130	u2360	m151	MOSS	No sir.
L422129	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
L422128	u2360	m151	MOSS	I don't know.
L422127	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	That is correct. And how do I decide?
L422126	u2360	m151	MOSS	You do, I reckon.
L422125	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
L422124	u2360	m151	MOSS	I don't know. American citizens.
L422123	u2362	m151	OFFICIAL	Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
L474666	u2625	m171	GARDNER	Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
L474665	u2621	m171	CLAY	Look of things, she doesn't.
L474664	u2625	m171	GARDNER	All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
L474663	u2621	m171	CLAY	I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
L474662	u2625	m171	GARDNER	What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
L474660	u2625	m171	GARDNER	Nobody. The light was bad.
L474659	u2621	m171	CLAY	Who shot who?
L474426	u2621	m171	CLAY	Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
L474425	u2625	m171	GARDNER	And that's more important than finding Lednov?
L474424	u2621	m171	CLAY	I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
L474423	u2625	m171	GARDNER	We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
L474422	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe he did.
L474421	u2625	m171	GARDNER	You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
L474412	u2625	m171	GARDNER	Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
L474411	u2621	m171	CLAY	Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
L474769	u2631	m171	MRS. WYATT	Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
L474768	u2621	m171	CLAY	And one of 'em is sick.
L474767	u2631	m171	MRS. WYATT	It doesn't matter who they are.
L474766	u2621	m171	CLAY	But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
L474765	u2631	m171	MRS. WYATT	Tell them to come on in.
L474763	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
L474762	u2631	m171	MRS. WYATT	You don't know how good it is to see you.
L475232	u2629	m171	MARY	I haven't got the job yet.
L475231	u2621	m171	CLAY	Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
L475230	u2629	m171	MARY	Why?
L475229	u2621	m171	CLAY	That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
L475227	u2629	m171	MARY	To the other side of the street.
L475226	u2621	m171	CLAY	Where you going?
L475219	u2621	m171	CLAY	Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
L475218	u2629	m171	MARY	Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
L475217	u2621	m171	CLAY	Thanks for taking over.
L475174	u2629	m171	MARY	By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
L475173	u2621	m171	CLAY	Goodbye, Mary.
L475172	u2629	m171	MARY	Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
L475164	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe they will.
L475163	u2629	m171	MARY	I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
L475162	u2621	m171	CLAY	Hurry up.
L475161	u2629	m171	MARY	I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
L475159	u2621	m171	CLAY	I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
L475158	u2629	m171	MARY	Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
L475155	u2629	m171	MARY	Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
L475154	u2621	m171	CLAY	It's going to Sonora.
L475153	u2629	m171	MARY	Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
L475149	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm sorry.
L475148	u2629	m171	MARY	I won't have you fighting over me.
L475122	u2621	m171	CLAY	Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
L475121	u2629	m171	MARY	If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
L475120	u2621	m171	CLAY	So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
L475068	u2621	m171	CLAY	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
L475067	u2629	m171	MARY	Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
L475064	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's right -- worry about your clothes --
L475063	u2629	m171	MARY	All my clothes --
L475062	u2621	m171	CLAY	I suppose that's my fault.
L475061	u2629	m171	MARY	No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
L475035	u2629	m171	MARY	Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
L475034	u2621	m171	CLAY	All right -- it's said!
L475033	u2629	m171	MARY	Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
L475032	u2621	m171	CLAY	If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
L475031	u2629	m171	MARY	I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
L475030	u2629	m171	MARY	I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
L475029	u2621	m171	CLAY	What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
L475026	u2629	m171	MARY	What does a man usually tell a girl?
L475025	u2621	m171	CLAY	What?
L475024	u2629	m171	MARY	Tell me, darling.
L475023	u2629	m171	MARY	You don't mean that Clay.
L475022	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe it's better that way.
L475021	u2629	m171	MARY	You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
L474981	u2629	m171	MARY	Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
L474980	u2621	m171	CLAY	You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
L474977	u2629	m171	MARY	So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
L474976	u2621	m171	CLAY	You know so much about me -- figure it out.
L474974	u2621	m171	CLAY	Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
L474973	u2629	m171	MARY	I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
L474972	u2621	m171	CLAY	Why do you think?
L474971	u2629	m171	MARY	Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
L474967	u2621	m171	CLAY	Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
L474966	u2629	m171	MARY	Don't you trust me?
L474943	u2621	m171	CLAY	No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
L474942	u2629	m171	MARY	You're not going out to look for them?
L474941	u2621	m171	CLAY	Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
L474940	u2621	m171	CLAY	It's too light yet.
L474939	u2629	m171	MARY	Are we leaving?
L474906	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's fine.
L474905	u2629	m171	MARY	He knows his alphabet.
L474840	u2629	m171	MARY	Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
L474839	u2621	m171	CLAY	Will she be dark or fair?
L474838	u2629	m171	MARY	But the rest is right.
L474837	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'll make the soap myself.
L474836	u2629	m171	MARY	She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
L474835	u2621	m171	CLAY	Go on. Tell me more about her.
L474834	u2629	m171	MARY	Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
L474833	u2629	m171	MARY	You should know. She's in your dream.
L474832	u2621	m171	CLAY	The who?
L474831	u2629	m171	MARY	You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
L474830	u2621	m171	CLAY	Thanks.
L474829	u2629	m171	MARY	I hope you get everything you want out of life --
L474827	u2629	m171	MARY	You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
L474826	u2621	m171	CLAY	I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
L474825	u2629	m171	MARY	You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
L474824	u2621	m171	CLAY	And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
L474823	u2629	m171	MARY	I suppose it is.
L474822	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
L474819	u2621	m171	CLAY	I hope so, too.
L474818	u2629	m171	MARY	No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
L474817	u2621	m171	CLAY	Coffee?
L474786	u2621	m171	CLAY	It's a long walk back to Aspen.
L474785	u2629	m171	MARY	We can't stay here!
L474784	u2621	m171	CLAY	Hold on.
L474783	u2629	m171	MARY	I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
L474782	u2621	m171	CLAY	Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
L474781	u2629	m171	MARY	So that was why she tried to run away.
L474712	u2621	m171	CLAY	No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
L474711	u2629	m171	MARY	Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
L474710	u2621	m171	CLAY	But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
L474689	u2621	m171	CLAY	His letters will keep.
L474688	u2629	m171	MARY	They're stragglin'.
L474687	u2621	m171	CLAY	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
L474686	u2629	m171	MARY	Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
L474684	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
L474683	u2629	m171	MARY	He's learning his letters.
L474682	u2621	m171	CLAY	Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
L474630	u2621	m171	CLAY	Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
L474629	u2629	m171	MARY	Like what?
L474626	u2629	m171	MARY	That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
L474625	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yeah.
L474624	u2629	m171	MARY	There's a nice boy.
L474596	u2621	m171	CLAY	Go on, there's a good boy.
L474595	u2629	m171	MARY	Would you, Mr. Phillips?
L474594	u2621	m171	CLAY	Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
L474592	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
L474591	u2629	m171	MARY	If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
L474585	u2629	m171	MARY	And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
L474584	u2621	m171	CLAY	Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
L474549	u2621	m171	CLAY	In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
L474548	u2629	m171	MARY	Where do you keep the can opener?
L474547	u2621	m171	CLAY	Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
L474546	u2629	m171	MARY	But you eat, don't you?
L474545	u2621	m171	CLAY	Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
L474544	u2629	m171	MARY	Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
L474538	u2621	m171	CLAY	It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
L474537	u2629	m171	MARY	So am I.
L474524	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
L474523	u2629	m171	MARY	And this is Helen Carter.
L474513	u2629	m171	MARY	Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
L474512	u2621	m171	CLAY	What's the matter with her?
L474509	u2621	m171	CLAY	You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
L474508	u2629	m171	MARY	Our kind of women?
L474504	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
L474503	u2629	m171	MARY	We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
L474502	u2621	m171	CLAY	You can stay here if you like.
L474501	u2629	m171	MARY	What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
L474500	u2621	m171	CLAY	Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
L474499	u2629	m171	MARY	You can't leave us here.
L474498	u2621	m171	CLAY	Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
L474497	u2629	m171	MARY	They won't be riding in the wagon.
L474490	u2621	m171	CLAY	Just about.
L474489	u2629	m171	MARY	As far as -- Sonora?
L474488	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yes, ma'am.
L474485	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
L474484	u2629	m171	MARY	And this is Helen Carter.
L474483	u2629	m171	MARY	It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
L474482	u2621	m171	CLAY	This must have been in the family a long time.
L474479	u2629	m171	MARY	Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
L474478	u2621	m171	CLAY	What's the matter with her?
L474477	u2629	m171	MARY	No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
L474476	u2621	m171	CLAY	Anybody hurt?
L474569	u2622	m171	CLAYTON	Hello, Miss Wells.
L474568	u2621	m171	CLAY	Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
L474565	u2622	m171	CLAYTON	She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
L474564	u2621	m171	CLAY	So did I. They were in it.
L474563	u2622	m171	CLAYTON	I found their surrey --
L474562	u2622	m171	CLAYTON	A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
L474561	u2621	m171	CLAY	Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
L474560	u2622	m171	CLAYTON	Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
L474898	u2621	m171	CLAY	No they won't.
L474897	u2623	m171	ELAINE	You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
L474896	u2621	m171	CLAY	I can't --
L474535	u2621	m171	CLAY	How's that?
L474534	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Which ranch?
L474533	u2621	m171	CLAY	Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
L474518	u2621	m171	CLAY	It wouldn't happen to be this...
L474517	u2623	m171	ELAINE	I -- lost something.
L475209	u2632	m171	STEVE	Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
L475208	u2621	m171	CLAY	I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
L475207	u2632	m171	STEVE	So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
L475206	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
L475205	u2632	m171	STEVE	Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
L475204	u2621	m171	CLAY	You'll live.
L475203	u2632	m171	STEVE	Kind of sore.
L475202	u2621	m171	CLAY	How's that?
L475188	u2621	m171	CLAY	I just wondered. Let's go.
L475187	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sure. What other reason would there be?
L475186	u2621	m171	CLAY	Is that the only reason you came back?
L475185	u2632	m171	STEVE	Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
L475184	u2621	m171	CLAY	What did you come back for?
L475182	u2621	m171	CLAY	You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
L475181	u2632	m171	STEVE	Half of them are mine.
L475179	u2621	m171	CLAY	You want to split up? --
L475178	u2632	m171	STEVE	It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
L475177	u2632	m171	STEVE	She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
L475176	u2621	m171	CLAY	I don't care what she asked you.
L475175	u2632	m171	STEVE	You know what she asked me?
L475143	u2632	m171	STEVE	You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
L475142	u2621	m171	CLAY	I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
L475141	u2632	m171	STEVE	Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
L475140	u2621	m171	CLAY	You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
L475139	u2632	m171	STEVE	You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
L475138	u2621	m171	CLAY	Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
L475137	u2632	m171	STEVE	Go on, hit me.
L475135	u2632	m171	STEVE	What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
L475134	u2621	m171	CLAY	Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
L475133	u2632	m171	STEVE	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
L475132	u2621	m171	CLAY	Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
L475130	u2632	m171	STEVE	That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
L475129	u2621	m171	CLAY	All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
L475127	u2621	m171	CLAY	You better start.
L475126	u2632	m171	STEVE	I didn't stop to think, Clay.
L474995	u2621	m171	CLAY	Just the grub box and bed rolls.
L474994	u2632	m171	STEVE	Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
L474933	u2621	m171	CLAY	There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
L474932	u2632	m171	STEVE	I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
L474931	u2621	m171	CLAY	Don't go arguing with your teacher.
L474912	u2632	m171	STEVE	There's only two of them now.
L474911	u2621	m171	CLAY	Finished, son?
L474910	u2632	m171	STEVE	Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
L474705	u2621	m171	CLAY	But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
L474704	u2632	m171	STEVE	Yeah, it does.
L474703	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
L474702	u2632	m171	STEVE	Maybe you shoulda killed him.
L474701	u2621	m171	CLAY	I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
L474700	u2632	m171	STEVE	Oh... that's the time you went away.
L474699	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
L474698	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
L474697	u2621	m171	CLAY	You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
L474696	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
L474695	u2621	m171	CLAY	I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
L474694	u2632	m171	STEVE	Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
L474692	u2632	m171	STEVE	I won't again.
L474691	u2621	m171	CLAY	It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
L474675	u2621	m171	CLAY	Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
L474674	u2632	m171	STEVE	Can I have my gun back?
L474673	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's right, Steve.
L474672	u2632	m171	STEVE	A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
L474670	u2621	m171	CLAY	Good thing you didn't.
L474669	u2632	m171	STEVE	They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
L474668	u2621	m171	CLAY	How'd you happen to miss?
L474667	u2632	m171	STEVE	There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
L474552	u2621	m171	CLAY	Swimming.
L474551	u2632	m171	STEVE	Where'd they go?
L474496	u2632	m171	STEVE	Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
L474495	u2621	m171	CLAY	I've got eleven horses.
L474474	u2621	m171	CLAY	Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
L474473	u2632	m171	STEVE	They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
L474470	u2632	m171	STEVE	Lednov.
L474469	u2621	m171	CLAY	He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
L474468	u2632	m171	STEVE	Why?
L474467	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
L474466	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
L474464	u2621	m171	CLAY	Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
L474463	u2632	m171	STEVE	And meet him there.
L474462	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's Lednov!  We come along here.
L474456	u2621	m171	CLAY	All right. I'll tell you.
L474455	u2632	m171	STEVE	Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
L474454	u2621	m171	CLAY	Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
L474453	u2632	m171	STEVE	At the ranch maybe?
L474452	u2621	m171	CLAY	Yes.
L474451	u2632	m171	STEVE	You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
L474449	u2632	m171	STEVE	This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
L474448	u2621	m171	CLAY	The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
L474447	u2632	m171	STEVE	In a fight?
L474446	u2621	m171	CLAY	You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
L474445	u2632	m171	STEVE	What was he in jail for?
L474444	u2621	m171	CLAY	The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
L474443	u2632	m171	STEVE	But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
L474440	u2632	m171	STEVE	Nice.
L474439	u2621	m171	CLAY	No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
L474438	u2632	m171	STEVE	You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
L474437	u2621	m171	CLAY	I don't want to run short.
L474436	u2632	m171	STEVE	Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
L474435	u2621	m171	CLAY	Like what?
L474434	u2632	m171	STEVE	You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
L474430	u2621	m171	CLAY	A man I used to know.
L474429	u2632	m171	STEVE	Who's Lednov?
L474402	u2632	m171	STEVE	I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
L474401	u2621	m171	CLAY	That's right.
L474395	u2621	m171	CLAY	A little hot.
L474394	u2632	m171	STEVE	How does she draw?
L474801	u2633	m171	WYATT	What's there to be fair about?
L474800	u2621	m171	CLAY	You're not bein' quite fair.
L474798	u2633	m171	WYATT	Nobody asked you to.
L474797	u2621	m171	CLAY	I can't take her with me.
L474796	u2633	m171	WYATT	All right, you didn't know.
L474795	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
L474794	u2633	m171	WYATT	What's there to be fair about?
L474793	u2621	m171	CLAY	You're not bein' quite fair.
L474791	u2633	m171	WYATT	Nobody asked you to.
L474790	u2621	m171	CLAY	I can't take her with me.
L474789	u2633	m171	WYATT	All right, you didn't know.
L474788	u2621	m171	CLAY	I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
L474761	u2621	m171	CLAY	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
L474760	u2633	m171	WYATT	Yeah, how did you know?
L474759	u2621	m171	CLAY	Three men on matched roans?
L474758	u2633	m171	WYATT	You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
L474654	u2632	m171	STEVE	That's a good girl.
L474653	u2623	m171	ELAINE	I'm sorry. Let's go.
L474652	u2632	m171	STEVE	Don't act so -- crazy.
L474651	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
L474650	u2632	m171	STEVE	Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
L474649	u2632	m171	STEVE	What's botherin' you, anyway?
L474648	u2623	m171	ELAINE	I said I didn't care.
L474647	u2632	m171	STEVE	Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
L474646	u2623	m171	ELAINE	I don't care.
L474645	u2632	m171	STEVE	You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
L474886	u2623	m171	ELAINE	If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
L474885	u2627	m171	HELEN	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
L474884	u2623	m171	ELAINE	She mustn't -- don't you let her --
L474883	u2627	m171	HELEN	That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
L474882	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Go away -- please.
L474881	u2627	m171	HELEN	Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
L474880	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Stop it -- stop it.
L474879	u2627	m171	HELEN	Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
L474878	u2623	m171	ELAINE	I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
L474877	u2627	m171	HELEN	Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
L474876	u2623	m171	ELAINE	But I want to stay.
L474875	u2627	m171	HELEN	Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
L474874	u2623	m171	ELAINE	It isn't that --
L474873	u2627	m171	HELEN	If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
L474872	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
L474871	u2627	m171	HELEN	He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
L474870	u2623	m171	ELAINE	Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
L475043	u2627	m171	HELEN	Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
L475042	u2624	m171	FOWLER	I figure we'll get along just fine.
L475037	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
L475036	u2627	m171	HELEN	You're sure there's more where this came from?
L475014	u2627	m171	HELEN	Then why stay in the hills.
L475013	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
L475012	u2627	m171	HELEN	I like it.
L475011	u2624	m171	FOWLER	That sure smells good.
L475009	u2627	m171	HELEN	You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
L475008	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
L475007	u2627	m171	HELEN	The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
L475006	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Just a thing I was workin' on.
L475005	u2627	m171	HELEN	What is it?
L475004	u2624	m171	FOWLER	No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
L475003	u2627	m171	HELEN	That something I shouldn't see?
L475002	u2627	m171	HELEN	Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
L475001	u2624	m171	FOWLER	You got no business snoopin' around --
L475092	u2624	m171	FOWLER	They went on like I told you.
L475091	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
L475086	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Go ahead.
L475085	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Suppose I take a look.
L475084	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Yeah.
L475083	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	And you're all alone.
L475082	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
L475081	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
L475080	u2624	m171	FOWLER	There aren't any women here.
L475079	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Even women?
L475078	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Yes, people make me restless.
L475077	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	What's the matter -- restless?
L475076	u2624	m171	FOWLER	Well, say it.
L475075	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
L474392	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	I don't like to see you go.
L474391	u2629	m171	MARY	Goodbye and thanks.
L474390	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
L474389	u2629	m171	MARY	We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
L474388	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	They shouldn't have done that.
L474387	u2629	m171	MARY	Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
L474381	u2629	m171	MARY	Thank you, Mr. Graham.
L474380	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
L474370	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	Depends on how good you drive.
L474369	u2629	m171	MARY	Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
L474368	u2626	m171	GRAHAM	What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
L474367	u2629	m171	MARY	Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
L475057	u2629	m171	MARY	I don't care what he thinks.
L475056	u2627	m171	HELEN	Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
L475048	u2629	m171	MARY	That's it then.
L475047	u2627	m171	HELEN	I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
L475046	u2627	m171	HELEN	Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
L475045	u2629	m171	MARY	-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
L475040	u2627	m171	HELEN	Maybe you are. I'm not.
L475039	u2629	m171	MARY	Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
L474992	u2627	m171	HELEN	Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
L474991	u2629	m171	MARY	We might as well start a fire.
L474862	u2627	m171	HELEN	Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
L474861	u2629	m171	MARY	What's the use.
L474860	u2627	m171	HELEN	Go on. Have another try at him.
L474858	u2629	m171	MARY	You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
L474857	u2627	m171	HELEN	Maybe I better start working on him.
L474856	u2629	m171	MARY	How many ways can a man say no.
L474855	u2627	m171	HELEN	You're not giving up?
L474854	u2627	m171	HELEN	What are you waiting for? Do something.
L474853	u2629	m171	MARY	He certainly could. About a month.
L474852	u2627	m171	HELEN	Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
L474851	u2629	m171	MARY	No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
L474850	u2627	m171	HELEN	We don't want to go there.
L474849	u2629	m171	MARY	Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
L474848	u2627	m171	HELEN	How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
L474845	u2629	m171	MARY	There's still tomorrow morning.
L474844	u2627	m171	HELEN	And we're running out of that.
L474843	u2629	m171	MARY	I tried my best, but these things take time.
L474812	u2627	m171	HELEN	Quit worryin' about Elaine.
L474811	u2629	m171	MARY	That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
L474810	u2627	m171	HELEN	It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
L474579	u2629	m171	MARY	Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
L474578	u2627	m171	HELEN	With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
L474516	u2629	m171	MARY	Now where's she goin'? --
L474515	u2627	m171	HELEN	You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
L474511	u2629	m171	MARY	Maybe in Sonora.
L474510	u2627	m171	HELEN	Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
L475110	u2627	m171	HELEN	I don't know -- I don't know.
L475109	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	How far up the trail?
L475108	u2627	m171	HELEN	Up the trail.
L475107	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Where is he?
L475106	u2627	m171	HELEN	Clay Phillips.
L475105	u2627	m171	HELEN	Stop it --
L475104	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
L475103	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Who brought you here?
L475102	u2627	m171	HELEN	Everybody knows --
L475101	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	How do you know who we are?
L475072	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Yeah, we sure have.
L475071	u2630	m171	MCCALL	We got company. Female company.
L474750	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
L474749	u2630	m171	MCCALL	One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
L474748	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	I said let's go.
L474747	u2630	m171	MCCALL	He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
L474746	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Because there's a man I want to see.
L474745	u2630	m171	MCCALL	What for?
L474744	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	We got to get movin'.
L474730	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Lookin' around.
L474729	u2633	m171	WYATT	What are you doin' --
L474722	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
L474721	u2633	m171	WYATT	That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
L474720	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Put on another one.
L474719	u2633	m171	WYATT	He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
L474716	u2628	m171	LEDNOV	Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
L474715	u2633	m171	WYATT	Why, yes. They're all I need...
L475225	u2629	m171	MARY	If you need me, I'll be --
L475224	u2632	m171	STEVE	Goodnight, Miss Wells.
L475223	u2629	m171	MARY	Goodnight.
L475151	u2629	m171	MARY	Steve --
L475150	u2632	m171	STEVE	You don't know what it is to be sorry.
L475124	u2629	m171	MARY	Thanks, Steve.
L475123	u2632	m171	STEVE	You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
L475115	u2632	m171	STEVE	It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
L475114	u2629	m171	MARY	For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
L474963	u2629	m171	MARY	Let me do that.
L474962	u2632	m171	STEVE	Oh, sure.
L474961	u2629	m171	MARY	She was only teasin'.
L474958	u2632	m171	STEVE	He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
L474957	u2629	m171	MARY	But you're his brother.
L474956	u2632	m171	STEVE	Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
L474953	u2632	m171	STEVE	I was doin' both. Here.
L474952	u2629	m171	MARY	You were supposed to be reading words.
L474951	u2632	m171	STEVE	Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
L474949	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sure.
L474948	u2629	m171	MARY	And you've got me all figured out?
L474947	u2632	m171	STEVE	Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
L474945	u2629	m171	MARY	Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
L474944	u2632	m171	STEVE	Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
L474935	u2632	m171	STEVE	Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
L474934	u2629	m171	MARY	Well, Steve?
L474930	u2632	m171	STEVE	I feel good anyways.
L474929	u2629	m171	MARY	You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
L474928	u2632	m171	STEVE	An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
L474927	u2632	m171	STEVE	Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
L474926	u2629	m171	MARY	Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
L474925	u2629	m171	MARY	Would they be good to eat?
L474924	u2632	m171	STEVE	How about California?
L474923	u2629	m171	MARY	No.
L474922	u2632	m171	STEVE	Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
L474921	u2629	m171	MARY	Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
L474920	u2632	m171	STEVE	What do they look like?
L474919	u2629	m171	MARY	Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
L474918	u2632	m171	STEVE	U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
L474917	u2629	m171	MARY	There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
L474916	u2632	m171	STEVE	-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
L474904	u2629	m171	MARY	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
L474903	u2632	m171	STEVE	And that's tough, isn't it?
L474902	u2629	m171	MARY	From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
L474901	u2632	m171	STEVE	Then I know my alphabet.
L474900	u2629	m171	MARY	That's the end of the line.
L474899	u2632	m171	STEVE	What comes after Z?
L474806	u2629	m171	MARY	No. We're not stayin' --
L474805	u2632	m171	STEVE	Aren't we stayin'?
L474680	u2632	m171	STEVE	Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
L474679	u2629	m171	MARY	Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
L474678	u2632	m171	STEVE	I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
L474677	u2629	m171	MARY	Why not? You went farther than that last time.
L474676	u2632	m171	STEVE	Gee, I can't.
L474623	u2629	m171	MARY	Good night, Steve.
L474622	u2632	m171	STEVE	Good night, Miss Wells.
L474620	u2632	m171	STEVE	Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
L474619	u2629	m171	MARY	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
L474618	u2632	m171	STEVE	You're so nice.
L474617	u2632	m171	STEVE	That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
L474616	u2629	m171	MARY	Maybe I could start you out.
L474615	u2632	m171	STEVE	I sure would.
L474614	u2629	m171	MARY	Would you like to learn them?
L474612	u2629	m171	MARY	Don't you even know your letters?
L474611	u2632	m171	STEVE	It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
L474610	u2629	m171	MARY	But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
L474609	u2632	m171	STEVE	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
L474608	u2629	m171	MARY	Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
L474606	u2632	m171	STEVE	I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
L474605	u2629	m171	MARY	Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
L474487	u2629	m171	MARY	I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
L474486	u2632	m171	STEVE	Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
L506071	u2750	m180	DAWSON	What do you mean, the horses?
L506070	u2751	m180	EMMETT	If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
L506069	u2751	m180	EMMETT	The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
L506068	u2750	m180	DAWSON	No money, eh?
L506067	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
L506064	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
L506063	u2750	m180	DAWSON	You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
L506062	u2751	m180	EMMETT	My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
L506061	u2750	m180	DAWSON	Posse? What the hell you talking about?
L506060	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
L506145	u2756	m180	JAKE	It was my fault.
L506144	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
L506041	u2756	m180	JAKE	Your next water ain't for three days.
L506040	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
L506019	u2751	m180	EMMETT	There's nobody coming?
L506018	u2756	m180	JAKE	I think we lost 'em.
L505954	u2756	m180	JAKE	Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
L505953	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
L505951	u2756	m180	JAKE	The one with the shotgun.
L505950	u2751	m180	EMMETT	What friend is that?
L505949	u2756	m180	JAKE	Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
L505948	u2751	m180	EMMETT	You're in here for winging a guy?
L505947	u2756	m180	JAKE	No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
L505946	u2751	m180	EMMETT	...And you had to kill him?
L505945	u2756	m180	JAKE	So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
L505944	u2756	m180	JAKE	Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
L505943	u2751	m180	EMMETT	That's why they got you in jail?
L505942	u2756	m180	JAKE	All I did was kiss a girl.
L505941	u2756	m180	JAKE	You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
L505940	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
L505939	u2756	m180	JAKE	Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
L506336	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
L506335	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	Forget it.
L506330	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	All right then.  Let's go.
L506329	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Sounds good.
L506328	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
L506327	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Did it seem short to you?
L506326	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	I didn't know you were out.
L506325	u2751	m180	EMMETT	McKendrick.
L506324	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	Emmett.
L506568	u2760	m180	MAL	Right.
L506567	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Gotta go.
L506522	u2760	m180	MAL	She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
L506521	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Kate?
L506518	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Is he alive?
L506517	u2760	m180	MAL	McKendrick's men got him.
L506516	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Where's Jake?
L506515	u2760	m180	MAL	I almost didn't.
L506406	u2760	m180	MAL	So far that's all I seen in this life.
L506405	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
L506404	u2760	m180	MAL	I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
L506403	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Have to.
L506402	u2760	m180	MAL	You'll never make it.
L506401	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
L506400	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'm sorry.
L506399	u2760	m180	MAL	This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
L506398	u2751	m180	EMMETT	That's it.
L506397	u2760	m180	MAL	I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
L506396	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
L506395	u2760	m180	MAL	Someplace safe. How you feeling?
L506394	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Where are we?
L506393	u2760	m180	MAL	Sure.
L506392	u2751	m180	EMMETT	...Gotta go...
L506098	u2760	m180	MAL	Yeah... maybe. So long.
L506097	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Maybe we'll see you sometime.
L506080	u2760	m180	MAL	Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
L506079	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Where were you?
L506078	u2760	m180	MAL	After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
L506572	u2751	m180	EMMETT	That I do.
L506571	u2753	m180	HANNAH	This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
L506570	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I already did that.
L506569	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
L506346	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
L506345	u2751	m180	EMMETT	How's Mr. Parker doing?
L506344	u2753	m180	HANNAH	We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
L506343	u2753	m180	HANNAH	It's one thing to know it...
L506342	u2751	m180	EMMETT	You must have known that before you came.
L506341	u2753	m180	HANNAH	This is a brutal land.
L506340	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Are you all right?
L506315	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Yeah... that must have been it.
L506314	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
L506313	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Didn't Paden tell you that?
L506312	u2751	m180	EMMETT	You don't make it easy on a fellow.
L506310	u2751	m180	EMMETT	That's why I'm here.
L506309	u2753	m180	HANNAH	You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
L506308	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
L506307	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Goodbye?
L506306	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I just came out to say goodbye.
L506305	u2753	m180	HANNAH	I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
L506304	u2753	m180	HANNAH	I guess I put a good scare into him.
L506303	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Paden sends his best.
L506302	u2753	m180	HANNAH	They've been kind to me.
L506301	u2751	m180	EMMETT	The Parkers seem like nice folks.
L506094	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
L506093	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Have you thought at all about your plans?
L506092	u2753	m180	HANNAH	More than enough.
L506038	u2754	m180	HOBART	And they were two of them. Look --
L506037	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
L506036	u2754	m180	HOBART	This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
L506035	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Hobart, what are you people doing here?
L505887	u2754	m180	HOBART	And you're not Baxter, either?
L505886	u2751	m180	EMMETT	My name is Emmett.
L505885	u2754	m180	HOBART	You're not Baxter?
L505884	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
L505883	u2754	m180	HOBART	I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
L505987	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'll be long gone.
L505986	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	I want you out of town before the hanging.
L505985	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I haven't done anything.
L505984	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
L505964	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
L505963	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Ten A.M.
L505962	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
L505936	u2751	m180	EMMETT	All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
L505935	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
L505934	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
L506575	u2762	m180	PADEN	I've got a job.
L506574	u2751	m180	EMMETT	You might make a farmer yet.
L506553	u2762	m180	PADEN	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
L506552	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'll see you around.
L506221	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
L506220	u2762	m180	PADEN	Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
L506219	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'm going to California with my brother.
L506218	u2762	m180	PADEN	All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
L506217	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Yeah?
L506216	u2762	m180	PADEN	Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
L506103	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I'll be around.
L506102	u2762	m180	PADEN	I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
L506084	u2762	m180	PADEN	Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
L506083	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Where you been?
L506057	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Anybody got any ideas?
L506056	u2762	m180	PADEN	You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
L505977	u2762	m180	PADEN	All right, you buy me a drink.
L505976	u2751	m180	EMMETT	You haven't got any money.
L505975	u2762	m180	PADEN	C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
L505974	u2751	m180	EMMETT	No hard feelings.
L505973	u2762	m180	PADEN	Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
L505972	u2751	m180	EMMETT	It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
L505971	u2762	m180	PADEN	It's not going to be easy.
L505970	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I understand.
L505969	u2762	m180	PADEN	You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
L505968	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
L505967	u2762	m180	PADEN	I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
L505966	u2751	m180	EMMETT	He is that.
L505965	u2762	m180	PADEN	Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
L505913	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Which way do you mean?
L505912	u2762	m180	PADEN	Doesn't look quite fair.
L505879	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I expect.
L505878	u2762	m180	PADEN	Women?
L505877	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I expect.
L505876	u2762	m180	PADEN	They got a saloon there?
L505875	u2751	m180	EMMETT	It's a town...
L505874	u2762	m180	PADEN	What's Turley like?
L505873	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
L505872	u2762	m180	PADEN	Going to Turley, was it?
L505871	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I gotta be going.
L505870	u2762	m180	PADEN	And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
L505869	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
L505822	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Yeah, maybe a bath.
L505821	u2762	m180	PADEN	Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
L505820	u2751	m180	EMMETT	South of here, past Chimayo.
L505819	u2762	m180	PADEN	Where's Turley?
L505818	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
L505817	u2762	m180	PADEN	Where's the pinto going?
L505816	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
L505815	u2762	m180	PADEN	Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
L505814	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Looks like that's not all they admired.
L505813	u2762	m180	PADEN	Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
L505812	u2751	m180	EMMETT	I had to get up anyway.
L505811	u2762	m180	PADEN	I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
L505810	u2751	m180	EMMETT	No, Leavenworth.
L505809	u2762	m180	PADEN	Jefferson City?
L505808	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Not for five years.
L505807	u2762	m180	PADEN	Offend anybody lately?
L505806	u2762	m180	PADEN	You got no idea what they were after?
L505805	u2751	m180	EMMETT	Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
L506158	u2760	m180	MAL	Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
L506157	u2752	m180	EZRA	That's a lie.
L506130	u2752	m180	EZRA	Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
L506129	u2760	m180	MAL	What about the law?
L506128	u2752	m180	EZRA	I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
L506127	u2760	m180	MAL	You own this land.
L506126	u2752	m180	EZRA	The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
L506125	u2760	m180	MAL	Who?
L506124	u2752	m180	EZRA	They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
L506123	u2760	m180	MAL	What happened?
L506122	u2752	m180	EZRA	She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
L506121	u2760	m180	MAL	Where is Rae?
L506118	u2752	m180	EZRA	I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
L506117	u2760	m180	MAL	Daddy?
L506114	u2753	m180	HANNAH	I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
L506113	u2762	m180	PADEN	What's that?
L506112	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Because they don't like what I want.
L506111	u2762	m180	PADEN	Why?
L506110	u2753	m180	HANNAH	They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
L506109	u2762	m180	PADEN	Believe it.
L506108	u2753	m180	HANNAH	A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
L506107	u2762	m180	PADEN	And a pretty lady.
L506106	u2753	m180	HANNAH	Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
L506089	u2753	m180	HANNAH	We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
L506088	u2762	m180	PADEN	Never will again.
L506087	u2753	m180	HANNAH	I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
L506086	u2762	m180	PADEN	He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
L506148	u2757	m180	KATE	I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
L506147	u2755	m180	J.T.	His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
L506146	u2757	m180	KATE	It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
L506143	u2757	m180	KATE	Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
L506142	u2755	m180	J.T.	The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
L506141	u2757	m180	KATE	Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
L506135	u2755	m180	J.T.	Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
L506134	u2757	m180	KATE	J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
L506538	u2762	m180	PADEN	Let's get out of here.
L506537	u2756	m180	JAKE	New record.
L506272	u2762	m180	PADEN	I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
L506271	u2756	m180	JAKE	What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
L506270	u2762	m180	PADEN	That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
L506269	u2756	m180	JAKE	All I did was kiss the girl.
L506268	u2762	m180	PADEN	Get out of here, Jake.
L506032	u2762	m180	PADEN	Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
L506031	u2756	m180	JAKE	Who is he?
L506030	u2762	m180	PADEN	He is now.
L506029	u2756	m180	JAKE	This a friend of yours?
L506016	u2756	m180	JAKE	He'll be here.
L506015	u2762	m180	PADEN	Where's your brother?
L506014	u2756	m180	JAKE	We wait.
L506013	u2762	m180	PADEN	What now?
L506012	u2756	m180	JAKE	That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
L505999	u2756	m180	JAKE	Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
L505998	u2762	m180	PADEN	We didn't get that far.
L505997	u2756	m180	JAKE	Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
L505994	u2756	m180	JAKE	Right!
L505993	u2762	m180	PADEN	The other guy drew first.
L505992	u2756	m180	JAKE	Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
L505991	u2762	m180	PADEN	I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
L505990	u2756	m180	JAKE	Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
L505989	u2762	m180	PADEN	I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
L505988	u2756	m180	JAKE	You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
L506231	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Really?
L506230	u2758	m180	KELLY	You can't do this.
L506229	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I'm done talking. Get out.
L506228	u2758	m180	KELLY	What are you talking about?
L506227	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
L506226	u2758	m180	KELLY	You wanted to see me?
L506198	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
L506197	u2758	m180	KELLY	Howdy.
L506196	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
L505926	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
L505925	u2760	m180	MAL	That ain't right.
L505924	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
L505923	u2760	m180	MAL	Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
L505922	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
L505921	u2760	m180	MAL	I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
L505920	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
L505928	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Don't press your luck, Carter.
L505927	u2763	m180	PROPRIETOR	Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
L505918	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Is that a fact?
L505917	u2763	m180	PROPRIETOR	We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
L505916	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	I don't like that word much, Carter.
L505915	u2763	m180	PROPRIETOR	This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
L505914	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	What's all this then?
L505958	u2762	m180	PADEN	I was afraid of that.
L505957	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
L505956	u2762	m180	PADEN	So this is the guy you're going to hang?
L505955	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	The jury saw it differently.
L505933	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
L505932	u2762	m180	PADEN	You're kidding.
L505931	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
L505930	u2762	m180	PADEN	We'd rather stay.
L505929	u2759	m180	LANGSTON	Now let's talk about you chaps.
L506421	u2764	m180	RAE	Shut up. You need help, don't you?
L506420	u2760	m180	MAL	Why him?
L506418	u2764	m180	RAE	Because I'm your sister.
L506417	u2760	m180	MAL	Why would they stop you?
L506416	u2764	m180	RAE	What makes you think I could?
L506415	u2760	m180	MAL	They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
L506414	u2764	m180	RAE	What's stopping you?
L506413	u2760	m180	MAL	Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
L506412	u2764	m180	RAE	Why come to me?
L506411	u2760	m180	MAL	Rae, I need help.
L506410	u2764	m180	RAE	Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
L506295	u2764	m180	RAE	I don't have any family any more.
L506294	u2760	m180	MAL	Rae, all we got is each other.
L506293	u2764	m180	RAE	It's none of your business.
L506292	u2760	m180	MAL	What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
L506285	u2764	m180	RAE	Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
L506284	u2760	m180	MAL	I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
L506283	u2764	m180	RAE	Who did it?
L506282	u2760	m180	MAL	He was murdered.
L506281	u2760	m180	MAL	Daddy's dead.
L506280	u2764	m180	RAE	What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
L506279	u2760	m180	MAL	Hello, Rae.
L506443	u2762	m180	PADEN	Where's Emmett now?
L506442	u2760	m180	MAL	Yeah, it's working out real good.
L506441	u2762	m180	PADEN	Lucky.
L506440	u2760	m180	MAL	I got there just short of too late.
L506438	u2760	m180	MAL	You don't know?
L506437	u2762	m180	PADEN	I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
L506436	u2760	m180	MAL	Because they enjoy it.
L506435	u2762	m180	PADEN	Why are they doing this, Mal?
L506096	u2762	m180	PADEN	Good luck, Mal.
L506095	u2760	m180	MAL	This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
L506353	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Did you hear his son is still around?
L506352	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	I heard that too.
L506351	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
L506350	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	We'll handle that. He's careless.
L506349	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	What about his brother?
L506348	u2761	m180	MCKENDRICK	He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
L506347	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	He must be pretty good.
L506565	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Good-bye, Paden.
L506564	u2762	m180	PADEN	Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
L506563	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
L506483	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
L506482	u2762	m180	PADEN	What's she got to do with it?
L506481	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
L506480	u2762	m180	PADEN	Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
L506479	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
L506478	u2762	m180	PADEN	I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
L506477	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
L506475	u2762	m180	PADEN	We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
L506474	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I thought we talked about that.
L506473	u2762	m180	PADEN	Yeah, maybe I will too.
L506472	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I'm going to have to look into this.
L506382	u2762	m180	PADEN	Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
L506381	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	So we understand each other?
L506380	u2762	m180	PADEN	I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
L506379	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
L506378	u2762	m180	PADEN	What is it you want from me?
L506377	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
L506376	u2762	m180	PADEN	Well, thanks, but forget it.
L506375	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Easy, boy. Just an idea.
L506373	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Maybe you could run it without Stella.
L506372	u2762	m180	PADEN	It is that.
L506371	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I told you this was a sweet set-up.
L506370	u2762	m180	PADEN	This is a lot of money.
L506369	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I took out thirteen dollars.
L506235	u2762	m180	PADEN	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
L506234	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Nothing like that will happen between us.
L506206	u2762	m180	PADEN	You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
L506205	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
L506204	u2762	m180	PADEN	Luck, I guess.
L506203	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	What brings you into my saloon?
L506201	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
L506200	u2762	m180	PADEN	I just got to town.
L506199	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	You got a place to stay?
L505861	u2762	m180	PADEN	Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
L505860	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
L505859	u2762	m180	PADEN	You're right.
L505858	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
L505857	u2762	m180	PADEN	You've got a legitimate job.
L505856	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
L505855	u2762	m180	PADEN	I've given that up.
L505854	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
L505853	u2762	m180	PADEN	Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
L505852	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Where's the dog?
L505851	u2762	m180	PADEN	It's been a while.
L505850	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I see you're prospering without me.
L505845	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
L505844	u2762	m180	PADEN	Hello, Cobb.
L506513	u2762	m180	PADEN	You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
L506512	u2766	m180	STELLA	I've got a place I can hide her.
L506506	u2766	m180	STELLA	He can't hurt me if he's dead.
L506505	u2762	m180	PADEN	I don't want you to get hurt.
L506504	u2766	m180	STELLA	How about you?
L506503	u2766	m180	STELLA	I'm ready for that.
L506502	u2762	m180	PADEN	I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
L506501	u2766	m180	STELLA	Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
L506494	u2762	m180	PADEN	Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
L506493	u2766	m180	STELLA	Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
L506492	u2762	m180	PADEN	You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
L506491	u2766	m180	STELLA	If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
L506490	u2762	m180	PADEN	What makes you say that?
L506489	u2766	m180	STELLA	Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
L506488	u2762	m180	PADEN	What do you mean?
L506487	u2766	m180	STELLA	What is it that I can't figure?
L506367	u2762	m180	PADEN	He left me.
L506366	u2766	m180	STELLA	Where's the dog now?
L506278	u2762	m180	PADEN	Give me some of the good stuff.
L506277	u2766	m180	STELLA	You really are a gambler.
L506256	u2762	m180	PADEN	Oh, yeah? How good?
L506255	u2766	m180	STELLA	That's the good stuff.
L506254	u2762	m180	PADEN	What's this?
L506253	u2762	m180	PADEN	I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
L506252	u2766	m180	STELLA	I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
L506251	u2762	m180	PADEN	Is this a fair mix?
L506191	u2766	m180	STELLA	Here he comes right now.
L506190	u2762	m180	PADEN	Who's the owner?
L506189	u2766	m180	STELLA	I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
L506188	u2762	m180	PADEN	Why'd you go into business with him?
L506187	u2766	m180	STELLA	Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
L506186	u2762	m180	PADEN	So-called?
L506185	u2766	m180	STELLA	That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
L506184	u2766	m180	STELLA	You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
L506183	u2762	m180	PADEN	You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
L506182	u2766	m180	STELLA	Me too. What's wrong with us?
L506181	u2762	m180	PADEN	It's the only place I'm happy.
L506180	u2766	m180	STELLA	You like a good saloon?
L506179	u2762	m180	PADEN	And I know what I'm talking about.
L506178	u2766	m180	STELLA	Thanks. That's what I call it too.
L506177	u2762	m180	PADEN	My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
L506176	u2766	m180	STELLA	I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
L506175	u2762	m180	PADEN	Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
L506174	u2762	m180	PADEN	Paden.
L506173	u2766	m180	STELLA	Stella.
L506172	u2762	m180	PADEN	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
L506171	u2766	m180	STELLA	The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
L506170	u2762	m180	PADEN	Nifty.
L506168	u2766	m180	STELLA	I run the place. What can I get you?
L506167	u2762	m180	PADEN	You work here?
L506360	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
L506359	u2766	m180	STELLA	From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
L506358	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	I thought you two would get along.
L506357	u2766	m180	STELLA	I wouldn't worry about that.
L506356	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
L506195	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
L506194	u2766	m180	STELLA	That was my plan.
L506193	u2765	m180	SHERIFF COBB	Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
L611301	u3308	m219	RAY	Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
L611300	u3300	m219	CARL	Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
L611288	u3308	m219	RAY	We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
L611287	u3300	m219	CARL	Rug samples.
L611286	u3308	m219	RAY	Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
L611285	u3308	m219	RAY	Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
L611284	u3300	m219	CARL	Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
L611283	u3308	m219	RAY	You're my hero, Carl.
L611282	u3300	m219	CARL	Yeah.
L611280	u3300	m219	CARL	Don't get too attached.
L611279	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey. Nice tie.
L611278	u3300	m219	CARL	Hey.
L611591	u3308	m219	RAY	They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
L611590	u3301	m219	CLEAR MOON	They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
L611589	u3301	m219	CLEAR MOON	Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
L611588	u3308	m219	RAY	Mr. Clear Moon.
L611412	u3308	m219	RAY	Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
L611411	u3301	m219	CLEAR MOON	Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
L611410	u3308	m219	RAY	I see.
L611409	u3301	m219	CLEAR MOON	Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
L611408	u3308	m219	RAY	I thought we were staying on the reservation.
L611435	u3302	m219	COOCH	The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
L611434	u3304	m219	DENNIS	You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
L611430	u3304	m219	DENNIS	Again. Figures, man.
L611429	u3302	m219	COOCH	A murder. On the reservation.
L611428	u3304	m219	DENNIS	FBI? What you investigatin'?
L611427	u3302	m219	COOCH	Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
L611424	u3304	m219	DENNIS	Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
L611423	u3302	m219	COOCH	Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
L611527	u3302	m219	COOCH	"-- don't ""man"" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?"
L611526	u3305	m219	LOOKS TWICE	You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
L611525	u3302	m219	COOCH	Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
L611524	u3305	m219	LOOKS TWICE	What's this about?
L611518	u3305	m219	LOOKS TWICE	That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
L611517	u3302	m219	COOCH	James Looks Twice?
L611516	u3305	m219	LOOKS TWICE	What are you doing?
L611329	u3302	m219	COOCH	Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
L611328	u3309	m219	TULLY	The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
L611327	u3302	m219	COOCH	It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.

L611366	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.

L612003	u3302	m219	COOCH	Come on, Ray. Come forward.
L611967	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
L611966	u3308	m219	RAY	We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
L611965	u3302	m219	COOCH	We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
L611964	u3308	m219	RAY	-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
L611963	u3302	m219	COOCH	This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
L611961	u3308	m219	RAY	What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.

L611846	u3302	m219	COOCH	Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.

L611737	u3308	m219	RAY	Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
L611736	u3302	m219	COOCH	She's that subtle?
L611735	u3308	m219	RAY	"It may have been Maggie's way of saying ""get off my ass."""
L611734	u3302	m219	COOCH	He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
L611733	u3308	m219	RAY	All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
L611732	u3302	m219	COOCH	Bastards...
L611730	u3302	m219	COOCH	And get rid of the dog.

L611723	u3308	m219	RAY	I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
L611722	u3302	m219	COOCH	Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
L611721	u3308	m219	RAY	I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
L611720	u3302	m219	COOCH	You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
L611719	u3308	m219	RAY	-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --

L611716	u3302	m219	COOCH	Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
L611706	u3308	m219	RAY	Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
L611705	u3302	m219	COOCH	The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
L611644	u3302	m219	COOCH	A long way from home. You be careful out there.
L611643	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
L611641	u3302	m219	COOCH	Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
L611640	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
L611639	u3302	m219	COOCH	Her oil pan is shot.
L611638	u3302	m219	COOCH	Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
L611637	u3308	m219	RAY	Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
L611636	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
L611631	u3308	m219	RAY	I gave it back to her.
L611630	u3302	m219	COOCH	Let's see it.
L611629	u3308	m219	RAY	She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
L611628	u3308	m219	RAY	"She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. ""What's the FBI really doing here."" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty."
L611627	u3302	m219	COOCH	What'd she say?
L611509	u3308	m219	RAY	Alright. Alright.
L611508	u3302	m219	COOCH	Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
L611507	u3308	m219	RAY	I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
L611506	u3302	m219	COOCH	Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
L611505	u3308	m219	RAY	They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
L611504	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's right.
L611503	u3308	m219	RAY	White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
L611501	u3302	m219	COOCH	One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
L611500	u3308	m219	RAY	Who is he?
L611498	u3308	m219	RAY	Cooch. You're my hero.
L611497	u3302	m219	COOCH	Meet me at base. Over.
L611496	u3302	m219	COOCH	I've got the doer. I know who he is.
L611495	u3308	m219	RAY	Go ahead.
L611494	u3302	m219	COOCH	I got one up on ya.
L611493	u3308	m219	RAY	How'd you know?
L611492	u3302	m219	COOCH	Maisy Blue Legs place?
L611445	u3302	m219	COOCH	Good.
L611444	u3308	m219	RAY	Couldn't sleep.
L611443	u3308	m219	RAY	I already did.
L611442	u3302	m219	COOCH	Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
L611441	u3308	m219	RAY	Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
L611405	u3308	m219	RAY	Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
L611404	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. That's Ray here. Ray...
L611398	u3308	m219	RAY	Beats the hell outta me.
L611397	u3302	m219	COOCH	Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
L611390	u3302	m219	COOCH	I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
L611389	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
L611381	u3302	m219	COOCH	We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
L611380	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
L611372	u3308	m219	RAY	-- a fucking cop.
L611371	u3302	m219	COOCH	Who the fuck is he?
L611370	u3308	m219	RAY	I did.
L611362	u3302	m219	COOCH	Check him out, Ray.
L611361	u3308	m219	RAY	This is a restricted area.
L611357	u3302	m219	COOCH	Ray.
L611356	u3308	m219	RAY	Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
L611355	u3302	m219	COOCH	That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
L611354	u3308	m219	RAY	Six rounds. 357.
L611345	u3302	m219	COOCH	No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
L611344	u3308	m219	RAY	You crashed my file?
L611343	u3302	m219	COOCH	"Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? ""To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests""?"
L611341	u3302	m219	COOCH	Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
L611340	u3308	m219	RAY	Were you in Nam?
L611339	u3302	m219	COOCH	The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
L611338	u3308	m219	RAY	Jesus...
L611337	u3302	m219	COOCH	Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
L611334	u3302	m219	COOCH	Seven.
L611333	u3308	m219	RAY	I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.

L611320	u3308	m219	RAY	South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
L612020	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.

L611939	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.

L611931	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	So they took care of Leo.
L611930	u3308	m219	RAY	Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
L611929	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
L611928	u3308	m219	RAY	That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

L611926	u3308	m219	RAY	1868...
L611925	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.

L611915	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I'm a full-blood Oglala.
L611914	u3308	m219	RAY	Sorry.
L611913	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
L611912	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Nothin'. Forget it.
L611911	u3308	m219	RAY	What do you mean?

L611895	u3308	m219	RAY	Crow Horse, listen --
L611894	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
L611765	u3308	m219	RAY	No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
L611764	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
L611763	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
L611762	u3308	m219	RAY	Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
L611760	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
L611759	u3308	m219	RAY	They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
L611758	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Still after Jimmy?
L611757	u3308	m219	RAY	And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
L611756	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
L611755	u3308	m219	RAY	What are you talking about?
L611754	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Not no more.
L611753	u3308	m219	RAY	Cuz you're a cop.
L611752	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Cuz I'm a skin?
L611751	u3308	m219	RAY	Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
L611750	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
L611749	u3308	m219	RAY	Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
L611748	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
L611700	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Likewise.
L611699	u3308	m219	RAY	Take care of yourself, Walter.
L611691	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
L611690	u3308	m219	RAY	I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
L611689	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
L611688	u3308	m219	RAY	It's not real.
L611687	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What you call myths, we call our history.
L611686	u3308	m219	RAY	Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
L611685	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	What'd you expect to hear?
L611684	u3308	m219	RAY	-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
L611683	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Ray --
L611682	u3308	m219	RAY	Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
L611681	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
L611680	u3308	m219	RAY	Don't tell me: heavy duty.
L611679	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Red Deer Table, Ray.
L611676	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	A what?
L611675	u3308	m219	RAY	I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
L611670	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
L611669	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
L611668	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
L611667	u3308	m219	RAY	The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
L611659	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
L611658	u3308	m219	RAY	That's not solid.
L611657	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
L611656	u3308	m219	RAY	I don't see the connection.
L611655	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
L611654	u3308	m219	RAY	-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
L611653	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
L611650	u3308	m219	RAY	She's your sister?
L611649	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
L611647	u3308	m219	RAY	I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
L611646	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
L611578	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
L611577	u3308	m219	RAY	Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
L611576	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	"He also said ""listen to the water."""
L611575	u3308	m219	RAY	The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
L611574	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
L611573	u3308	m219	RAY	So what?
L611572	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He saw an owl.
L611571	u3308	m219	RAY	And...
L611570	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
L611568	u3308	m219	RAY	Because he was talking to me.
L611567	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Why should I tell you.
L611566	u3308	m219	RAY	What was he saying?
L611564	u3308	m219	RAY	He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
L611563	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He said he doesn't know.
L611562	u3308	m219	RAY	What did he say?
L611556	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
L611555	u3308	m219	RAY	What's he smoke in that?
L611552	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
L611551	u3308	m219	RAY	He knows me?
L611550	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
L611548	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
L611547	u3308	m219	RAY	What did he say?
L611545	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
L611544	u3308	m219	RAY	Why does he wanna see me?
L611543	u3308	m219	RAY	Medicine. As in medicine man?
L611542	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
L611541	u3308	m219	RAY	Let's go.
L611540	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
L611539	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
L611538	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
L611537	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
L611478	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
L611477	u3308	m219	RAY	Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
L611476	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
L611475	u3308	m219	RAY	His spiritual mother...
L611474	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
L611473	u3308	m219	RAY	-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
L611472	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
L611471	u3308	m219	RAY	Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
L611470	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
L611469	u3308	m219	RAY	You've got no jurisdiction.
L611468	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
L611467	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
L611466	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
L611465	u3308	m219	RAY	You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
L611464	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
L611463	u3308	m219	RAY	Bullshit.
L611462	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
L611459	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
L611458	u3308	m219	RAY	Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
L611457	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	You're steppin' on sign.
L611456	u3308	m219	RAY	What?!
L611455	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	Watch out!
L611454	u3308	m219	RAY	What are you --
L611385	u3308	m219	RAY	After we've completed our investigation.
L611384	u3303	m219	CROW HORSE	I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
L611813	u3308	m219	RAY	Great.
L611812	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
L611811	u3308	m219	RAY	What?
L611810	u3308	m219	RAY	NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
L611809	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Your relatives must've taught you something.
L611803	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
L611802	u3308	m219	RAY	I desecrated it?
L611801	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
L611800	u3308	m219	RAY	You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
L611623	u3308	m219	RAY	Move it, Magdelana.
L611622	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
L611621	u3308	m219	RAY	When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
L611620	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Thank you.
L611618	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
L611617	u3308	m219	RAY	Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
L611616	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
L611615	u3308	m219	RAY	A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
L611614	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
L611613	u3308	m219	RAY	Who did?
L611612	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
L611611	u3308	m219	RAY	He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
L611610	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
L611609	u3308	m219	RAY	Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
L611608	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
L611607	u3308	m219	RAY	This Jimmy's?
L611604	u3308	m219	RAY	That's right. Turn around.
L611603	u3306	m219	MAGGIE	You're the Indian FBI.

L611330	u3309	m219	TULLY	With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --

L611869	u3308	m219	RAY	Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
L611868	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
L611867	u3308	m219	RAY	Get up out of the chair, Richard.
L611866	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What the fuck you talkin' about?
L611865	u3308	m219	RAY	Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
L611862	u3308	m219	RAY	Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
L611861	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Washington sent ya. I know that.
L611860	u3308	m219	RAY	No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
L611859	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	You ever try solitary confinement?
L611858	u3308	m219	RAY	Leavenworth a tough joint?
L611857	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
L611856	u3308	m219	RAY	At Sioux Falls Pen?
L611855	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
L611854	u3308	m219	RAY	Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
L611853	u3310	m219	YELLOW BIRD	What ya want?
L258916	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why?
L258915	u5684	m376	TOM	The point was to love each other.
L258914	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
L258911	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why?
L258910	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't know any other way, Annie.
L258906	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
L258905	u5684	m376	TOM	I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
L258903	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I can't do this. I can't leave you...
L258902	u5684	m376	TOM	Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
L258901	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't care! We'd be together.
L258900	u5684	m376	TOM	Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
L258899	u5674	m376	ANNIE	One more time.
L258898	u5684	m376	TOM	Annie!
L258897	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Show me again.
L258890	u5684	m376	TOM	Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
L258889	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
L258888	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I won't ask you to.
L258887	u5684	m376	TOM	I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
L258848	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?!
L258847	u5684	m376	TOM	Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
L258767	u5684	m376	TOM	Tom.
L258766	u5674	m376	ANNIE	This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
L258616	u5684	m376	TOM	Huh?
L258615	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You missed a button.
L258614	u5684	m376	TOM	Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
L258613	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I am comfortable.
L258612	u5684	m376	TOM	Just make yourself comfortable.
L258611	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
L258610	u5684	m376	TOM	Everything under control?
L258587	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How did you find out all that?
L258586	u5684	m376	TOM	Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
L258585	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
L258584	u5684	m376	TOM	I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
L258583	u5674	m376	ANNIE	We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
L258582	u5684	m376	TOM	Ever think of moving there full time?
L258581	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It is. It's lovely.
L258580	u5684	m376	TOM	Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
L258579	u5684	m376	TOM	She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
L258578	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why didn't it work out?
L258576	u5684	m376	TOM	College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
L258575	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How did you meet her?
L258574	u5684	m376	TOM	Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
L258573	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Son?
L258572	u5684	m376	TOM	Five years. My son was born here.
L258571	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How long did you live here with your wife?
L258566	u5674	m376	ANNIE	OK.
L258565	u5684	m376	TOM	You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
L258564	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah.
L258563	u5684	m376	TOM	Feel good?
L258562	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Thanks.
L258561	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
L258560	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
L258559	u5684	m376	TOM	OK. I'll stop talking then.
L258558	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
L258557	u5684	m376	TOM	Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
L258556	u5684	m376	TOM	No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
L258555	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
L258554	u5684	m376	TOM	He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
L258553	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Poor thing.
L258552	u5684	m376	TOM	You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
L258551	u5674	m376	ANNIE	The answer's no.
L258514	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I can handle it!
L258513	u5684	m376	TOM	Need a lift?
L258512	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Shit.
L258511	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You too.
L258510	u5684	m376	TOM	Enjoy the day.
L258509	u5684	m376	TOM	Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
L258508	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
L258505	u5674	m376	ANNIE	She did?
L258504	u5684	m376	TOM	Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
L258503	u5674	m376	ANNIE	He's beautiful.
L258502	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh yes. I forgot.
L258501	u5684	m376	TOM	It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
L258500	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I have a way with animals.
L258499	u5684	m376	TOM	I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
L258498	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I thought you lived in Chicago?
L258497	u5684	m376	TOM	Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
L258496	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
L258494	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
L258493	u5684	m376	TOM	You sleeping all right in that house?
L258492	u5674	m376	ANNIE	If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
L258491	u5684	m376	TOM	Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
L258490	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
L258489	u5684	m376	TOM	A jogger, huh?
L258488	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
L258474	u5684	m376	TOM	Just who's been laughing at who here?
L258473	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, I, uh... you didn't...
L258472	u5684	m376	TOM	I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
L258471	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You were married to a woman in Chicago?
L258470	u5684	m376	TOM	When I was first married.
L258469	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You lived in Chicago?
L258468	u5684	m376	TOM	Does Chicago count?
L258467	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
L258466	u5684	m376	TOM	What's that to miss?
L258465	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
L258464	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
L258463	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
L258462	u5684	m376	TOM	Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
L258461	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
L258460	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
L258459	u5684	m376	TOM	You ever just stand still for a minute?
L258458	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?
L258455	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
L258454	u5684	m376	TOM	So how was your first and last day of branding?
L258411	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It is cocktail hour yet?
L258410	u5684	m376	TOM	You okay?
L258391	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
L258390	u5684	m376	TOM	You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
L258355	u5684	m376	TOM	That's up to Pilgrim.
L258354	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
L258353	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
L258273	u5684	m376	TOM	Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
L258272	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
L258269	u5684	m376	TOM	You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
L258268	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, that'll be a little complicated --
L258267	u5684	m376	TOM	When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
L258261	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
L258260	u5684	m376	TOM	Doesn't matter.
L258259	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
L258258	u5684	m376	TOM	Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
L258244	u5674	m376	ANNIE	"Look! Please! Don't do the ""shucks, ma'am"" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?"
L258243	u5684	m376	TOM	I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
L258242	u5684	m376	TOM	All by yourself?
L258241	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
L258240	u5684	m376	TOM	You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
L258239	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
L258238	u5684	m376	TOM	Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
L258237	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
L258236	u5684	m376	TOM	Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
L258235	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
L258093	u5684	m376	TOM	I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
L258092	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
L258091	u5684	m376	TOM	I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
L258090	u5684	m376	TOM	Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
L258089	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
L258088	u5684	m376	TOM	Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
L258087	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
L258086	u5684	m376	TOM	Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
L258085	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
L258084	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
L258083	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
L258081	u5684	m376	TOM	Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
L258080	u5674	m376	ANNIE	This is Annie MacLean.
L258936	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Go ahead...
L258935	u5678	m376	GRACE	Great!
L258931	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Hi.
L258930	u5678	m376	GRACE	Good.
L258929	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How's everything?
L258928	u5678	m376	GRACE	So do you.
L258927	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
L258885	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
L258884	u5678	m376	GRACE	Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
L258883	u5678	m376	GRACE	Tom's gone.
L258882	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
L258777	u5678	m376	GRACE	Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
L258776	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Let's bring your bags inside.
L258721	u5678	m376	GRACE	Sure.
L258720	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
L258719	u5678	m376	GRACE	Who is it?
L258712	u5678	m376	GRACE	So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
L258711	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?
L258710	u5678	m376	GRACE	I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
L258709	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
L258708	u5678	m376	GRACE	Why should they?
L258707	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That's not true.
L258706	u5678	m376	GRACE	Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
L258705	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?... Oh baby...
L258704	u5678	m376	GRACE	Who's going to want me now?
L258703	u5678	m376	GRACE	I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
L258702	u5674	m376	ANNIE	When? Tonight?
L258701	u5678	m376	GRACE	My period.
L258700	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Started what?
L258699	u5678	m376	GRACE	I said... I started.
L258698	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What did you say?
L258697	u5678	m376	GRACE	LEAVE ME ALONE!!
L258696	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
L258695	u5678	m376	GRACE	Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
L258694	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
L258693	u5678	m376	GRACE	FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
L258692	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
L258691	u5678	m376	GRACE	Well, now you know what it feels like.
L258690	u5674	m376	ANNIE	WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
L258689	u5678	m376	GRACE	NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
L258688	u5674	m376	ANNIE	STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
L258687	u5678	m376	GRACE	Yeah, you know everything!!
L258686	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
L258685	u5678	m376	GRACE	Tom?
L258684	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
L258683	u5678	m376	GRACE	I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
L258682	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Grace, I don't hate your father.
L258681	u5678	m376	GRACE	You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
L258680	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What are you talking about?
L258679	u5678	m376	GRACE	... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
L258678	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
L258677	u5678	m376	GRACE	Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
L258676	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well...  So you tried riding again?
L258675	u5678	m376	GRACE	About what?
L258674	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
L258666	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Did you go riding?
L258665	u5678	m376	GRACE	Nothing.
L258606	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Thanks, honey.
L258605	u5678	m376	GRACE	I'll take care of it.
L258604	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Does anybody out there want something to drink?
L258603	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You're right. Good.
L258602	u5678	m376	GRACE	Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
L258601	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, one was for salad...
L258600	u5678	m376	GRACE	I thought there were too many forks on the table.
L258393	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
L258392	u5678	m376	GRACE	I'll come.
L258389	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No. I just thought... forget it.
L258388	u5678	m376	GRACE	Why? There's no food in the house?
L258387	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
L258386	u5678	m376	GRACE	If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
L258385	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You got everything you need?
L258376	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
L258375	u5678	m376	GRACE	Did he mention it?
L258374	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You already did.
L258373	u5678	m376	GRACE	Did you ask him to come visit?
L258358	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Hi.
L258357	u5678	m376	GRACE	We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
L258320	u5678	m376	GRACE	I think they call it a pasture.
L258319	u5674	m376	ANNIE	He's still sitting in that damn field.
L258220	u5678	m376	GRACE	I didn't see it.
L258219	u5674	m376	ANNIE	There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
L258218	u5678	m376	GRACE	"What would they say? ""Ten miles to big rock."" ""Twenty miles to bigger rock."""
L258217	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Don't they believe in signs here?
L258216	u5678	m376	GRACE	Gee, this looks like a fun place.
L258215	u5678	m376	GRACE	Little.
L258214	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You buckled up?  You cold?
L258209	u5678	m376	GRACE	No, you just act like you do.
L258208	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
L258207	u5678	m376	GRACE	Then why do you want to leave?
L258206	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That's not true!
L258205	u5678	m376	GRACE	He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
L258204	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Did he tell you that?
L258203	u5678	m376	GRACE	You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
L258202	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
L258201	u5678	m376	GRACE	You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
L258200	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't believe this!
L258199	u5678	m376	GRACE	Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
L258198	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
L258197	u5678	m376	GRACE	What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
L258196	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
L258195	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
L258194	u5678	m376	GRACE	What?
L258193	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How long is this going to go on?
L258191	u5678	m376	GRACE	You were never thirteen, Mom.
L258190	u5674	m376	ANNIE	This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
L258189	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't care.
L258188	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't care.
L258187	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Would you like to see that?
L258182	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You don't.
L258181	u5678	m376	GRACE	I didn't know I had to.
L258180	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh. You didn't tell me.
L258179	u5678	m376	GRACE	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
L258178	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You should call your dad before it gets too late.
L258175	u5678	m376	GRACE	Fine.
L258174	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Fine!
L258173	u5678	m376	GRACE	Whatever you want.
L258172	u5674	m376	ANNIE	IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
L258164	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't care.
L258163	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
L258162	u5678	m376	GRACE	-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
L258161	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
L258160	u5678	m376	GRACE	Fine -- I'll take my bath.
L258159	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
L258110	u5678	m376	GRACE	I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
L258109	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?
L258108	u5678	m376	GRACE	Maybe they should put me down too.
L258107	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah?
L258106	u5678	m376	GRACE	Mom?
L258105	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
L258104	u5678	m376	GRACE	I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
L258103	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
L258102	u5678	m376	GRACE	What about him?
L258101	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Have you decided about Pilgrim?
L258100	u5678	m376	GRACE	Doesn't matter.
L258099	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Grace, I put it on the table near your --
L258098	u5678	m376	GRACE	No, you didn't.
L258097	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I brought it to you in the hospital.
L258096	u5678	m376	GRACE	I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
L258015	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's still early. What's your next class?
L258014	u5678	m376	GRACE	Fine!
L258013	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
L258012	u5678	m376	GRACE	Is that your version of a pep talk?
L258011	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
L258010	u5678	m376	GRACE	I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
L258009	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
L258008	u5678	m376	GRACE	Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
L258007	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, honey... What happened?
L258003	u5678	m376	GRACE	Okay.
L258002	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
L257991	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
L257990	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why don't you go lie down?
L257982	u5678	m376	GRACE	I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
L257981	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
L258523	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	All right. Speak to you then.
L258522	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Uh, yes... Sure, David.
L258520	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
L258519	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
L258518	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
L258517	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
L257890	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Exactly...
L257889	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
L257888	u5674	m376	ANNIE	David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
L257887	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
L257886	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yes. We're suing.
L257885	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	Did you speak to Farlow?
L257884	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
L257883	u5675	m376	DAVID GOTTSCHALK	Who's there?
L257882	u5674	m376	ANNIE	David?
L258940	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
L258939	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Where to?
L258938	u5682	m376	ROBERT	You want to take a walk with me?
L258937	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I have so much to tell you.
L258934	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
L258933	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Was the trip okay?
L258926	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Tubab means white man.
L258925	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What do you mean?
L258924	u5682	m376	ROBERT	"No. I am a ""tubab."""
L258923	u5674	m376	ANNIE	"Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for ""Tubab"" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you ""Tubab""?"
L258922	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Yes?
L258881	u5682	m376	ROBERT	And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
L258880	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't understa-
L258879	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
L258877	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What do you mean?
L258876	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Take your time.
L258875	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah, what?
L258874	u5682	m376	ROBERT	May I have a suggestion?
L258873	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
L258872	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
L258871	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
L258811	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Let's not talk about that now.
L258810	u5682	m376	ROBERT	How are you feeling about work?
L258809	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
L258808	u5682	m376	ROBERT	You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
L258807	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
L258806	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
L258805	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
L258804	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You're allergic to hay.
L258803	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
L258487	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
L258486	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
L258485	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
L258484	u5674	m376	ANNIE	About what?
L258483	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
L258482	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I wish I did.
L258481	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
L258480	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Huh-huh. You?
L258479	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Everything all right.
L258478	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Oh well... branding will do that to you.
L258477	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
L258476	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I thought you guys were going to call me.
L258372	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Night.
L258371	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Good night.
L258370	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I know. We miss you too.
L258369	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I miss you, Annie.
L258368	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Okay.
L258367	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
L258366	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
L258365	u5682	m376	ROBERT	When are you coming home?
L258364	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
L258363	u5682	m376	ROBERT	So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
L258362	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, it's good that you're there.
L258361	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
L258360	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
L258152	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
L258151	u5682	m376	ROBERT	And you think it's best if I don't come.
L258150	u5674	m376	ANNIE	She will if you think she should.
L258149	u5682	m376	ROBERT	What if she doesn't want to go?
L258148	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
L258147	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
L258144	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I'm not pretending anything!
L258143	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
L258142	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
L258141	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
L258140	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
L258139	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why?!
L258138	u5682	m376	ROBERT	No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
L258137	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
L258136	u5682	m376	ROBERT	What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
L258135	u5674	m376	ANNIE	He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
L258134	u5682	m376	ROBERT	You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
L258133	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
L258132	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
L258131	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No. I was just researching. Calm down.
L258130	u5682	m376	ROBERT	You've already made arrangements!?
L258129	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
L258128	u5682	m376	ROBERT	NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
L258127	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
L258126	u5682	m376	ROBERT	That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
L258125	u5674	m376	ANNIE	He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
L258124	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I don't understand. You just said he said no.
L258122	u5674	m376	ANNIE	About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
L258121	u5682	m376	ROBERT	What was I saying?
L258118	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No.
L258117	u5682	m376	ROBERT	What did he say?
L258116	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah.
L258115	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
L258114	u5682	m376	ROBERT	They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
L258113	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Why did you go?
L258112	u5682	m376	ROBERT	"All our ""favorite"" people were there saying all their ""favorite"" things about their ""favorite"" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with."
L258111	u5674	m376	ANNIE	How was the dinner?
L257997	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
L257996	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Doing what?
L257995	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You've got to stop doing that?
L257976	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Do you? Do you really?
L257975	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I love you.
L257974	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Aw... that's so sweet.
L257973	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
L257972	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
L257971	u5682	m376	ROBERT	How's my pregnant chick!
L257970	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Sing it to me, Frankie!
L257969	u5682	m376	ROBERT	"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
L257966	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh. Right. I'll call him.
L257965	u5682	m376	ROBERT	... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
L257964	u5682	m376	ROBERT	It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
L257963	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Okay.
L257962	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
L257961	u5682	m376	ROBERT	The funeral's on Friday.
L257960	u5674	m376	ANNIE	We're very lucky.
L257959	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
L257958	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
L257957	u5682	m376	ROBERT	No, let me go.
L257956	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I should go get some of her things.
L257954	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
L257953	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What did he say?
L257930	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Tch. What are you --
L257929	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I'm sorry.
L257924	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Robert, you leave it up these people...!
L257923	u5682	m376	ROBERT	No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
L257922	u5674	m376	ANNIE	That bag's almost empty.
L257910	u5682	m376	ROBERT	She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
L257909	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What about Grace?
L257868	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Yeah. Bye.
L257867	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Okay. We'll see you later then.
L257866	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't know. We'll figure it out.
L257865	u5682	m376	ROBERT	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
L257864	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
L257863	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Riding with Judith.
L257862	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Sure... What's Grace up to?
L257861	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Okay. You want me to pick you up?
L257860	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I should be in by two.
L257859	u5682	m376	ROBERT	So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
L257858	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Hi.
L257857	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Hi.
L257856	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's me.
L258853	u5677	m376	FRANK	Either fight the way things are or accept it.
L258852	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What choice!!?
L258851	u5677	m376	FRANK	No. He had the choice.
L258850	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's so cruel.
L258631	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
L258630	u5677	m376	FRANK	I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
L258623	u5677	m376	FRANK	We have a business manager. The best around.
L258622	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
L258350	u5677	m376	FRANK	Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
L258349	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, I don't know...
L258348	u5677	m376	FRANK	Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
L258344	u5677	m376	FRANK	Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
L258343	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
L258866	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You too, Diane.
L258865	u5676	m376	DIANE	Good luck to you, Annie.
L258864	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Promise.
L258863	u5676	m376	DIANE	Promise?
L258862	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
L258860	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
L258859	u5676	m376	DIANE	Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
L258799	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, how sweet.
L258798	u5676	m376	DIANE	I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
L258780	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
L258779	u5676	m376	DIANE	Well, I am going to go after lunch.
L258778	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
L258764	u5676	m376	DIANE	He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
L258763	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
L258762	u5676	m376	DIANE	Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
L258761	u5674	m376	ANNIE	What?
L258760	u5676	m376	DIANE	Yes, it does.
L258759	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Sounds like something Tom would say.
L258758	u5676	m376	DIANE	They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
L258757	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Frank's a good man.
L258756	u5676	m376	DIANE	I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
L258755	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
L258754	u5676	m376	DIANE	Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
L258753	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
L258752	u5676	m376	DIANE	You don't seem to upset?
L258751	u5674	m376	ANNIE	No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
L258750	u5676	m376	DIANE	They fired you?
L258749	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
L258748	u5676	m376	DIANE	Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
L258651	u5676	m376	DIANE	Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
L258650	u5674	m376	ANNIE	You and Frank ever take a vacation?
L258649	u5676	m376	DIANE	I'd love to go there one time...
L258648	u5674	m376	ANNIE	But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
L258647	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
L258646	u5676	m376	DIANE	What was it like?
L258645	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I was there for that shot, actually.
L258644	u5676	m376	DIANE	I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
L258643	u5676	m376	DIANE	No reason you should, no reason you should.
L258642	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
L258641	u5676	m376	DIANE	I'll help you with the coffee.
L258525	u5676	m376	DIANE	Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
L258524	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Thank you. You're all doing too much.
L258445	u5674	m376	ANNIE	I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
L258444	u5676	m376	DIANE	Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
L258443	u5676	m376	DIANE	Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
L258442	u5674	m376	ANNIE	She calls him Tommy...
L258441	u5676	m376	DIANE	Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
L258439	u5676	m376	DIANE	Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
L258438	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Where does this go, Diane?
L258346	u5674	m376	ANNIE	It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
L258345	u5676	m376	DIANE	How's Peterson's holding up for you?
L258332	u5676	m376	DIANE	No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
L258331	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
L258330	u5676	m376	DIANE	Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
L258326	u5676	m376	DIANE	Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
L258325	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
L258324	u5676	m376	DIANE	Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
L258323	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
L258322	u5676	m376	DIANE	There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
L258158	u5681	m376	LIZ	Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
L258157	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Of course not.
L258156	u5681	m376	LIZ	Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
L258155	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Maybe we should give him another sedative.
L257951	u5674	m376	ANNIE	And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
L257950	u5681	m376	LIZ	It isn't right to make him suffer...
L257949	u5674	m376	ANNIE	... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
L257948	u5681	m376	LIZ	Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
L257947	u5674	m376	ANNIE	- See, what you can do for him --...
L257946	u5681	m376	LIZ	I understand, but Annie, please...
L257945	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
L257938	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Well, of course, right...
L257937	u5681	m376	LIZ	Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
L257936	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
L257934	u5681	m376	LIZ	Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
L257933	u5674	m376	ANNIE	Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
L257932	u5681	m376	LIZ	Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
L258856	u5676	m376	DIANE	Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
L258855	u5677	m376	FRANK	Diane!
L258854	u5676	m376	DIANE	Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
L258743	u5676	m376	DIANE	You!
L258742	u5677	m376	FRANK	Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
L258352	u5677	m376	FRANK	It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
L258351	u5676	m376	DIANE	They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
L258285	u5677	m376	FRANK	I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
L258284	u5676	m376	DIANE	What?
L258283	u5677	m376	FRANK	Mixed salad.
L258280	u5676	m376	DIANE	I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
L258279	u5677	m376	FRANK	Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
L258278	u5676	m376	DIANE	... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
L258816	u5684	m376	TOM	No thanks.
L258815	u5676	m376	DIANE	I have some brownies left over. Want one?
L258626	u5676	m376	DIANE	Ain't brain surgery.
L258625	u5684	m376	TOM	Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
L258624	u5676	m376	DIANE	Ha...
L258287	u5676	m376	DIANE	Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
L258286	u5684	m376	TOM	I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
L258282	u5676	m376	DIANE	What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
L258281	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't believe they'll expect that.
L258434	u5679	m376	JOE	Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
L258433	u5677	m376	FRANK	Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
L258340	u5677	m376	FRANK	Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
L258339	u5679	m376	JOE	Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
L258289	u5677	m376	FRANK	Weekend after next...
L258288	u5679	m376	JOE	When you figure on branding?
L258227	u5679	m376	JOE	There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
L258226	u5677	m376	FRANK	That's what some folks say.
L258225	u5679	m376	JOE	He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
L258224	u5679	m376	JOE	There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
L258223	u5677	m376	FRANK	Sure. As long as she don't mind.
L258222	u5679	m376	JOE	Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
L258787	u5684	m376	TOM	He thought it was a ghost.
L258786	u5677	m376	FRANK	We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
L258620	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't think Warren would go for that.
L258619	u5677	m376	FRANK	It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
L258436	u5677	m376	FRANK	And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
L258435	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
L258342	u5677	m376	FRANK	Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
L258341	u5684	m376	TOM	They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
L258338	u5684	m376	TOM	We should be fine, then.
L258337	u5677	m376	FRANK	Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
L258295	u5684	m376	TOM	Yeah.
L258294	u5677	m376	FRANK	Tom?
L258233	u5677	m376	FRANK	You know her?
L258232	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't believe it.
L258747	u5678	m376	GRACE	You know, you're a good kid.
L258746	u5679	m376	JOE	I wouldn't let happen.
L258745	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
L258744	u5679	m376	JOE	You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
L258593	u5679	m376	JOE	I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
L258592	u5678	m376	GRACE	Of course I have.
L258591	u5679	m376	JOE	Have you talked to Tom about it?
L258590	u5678	m376	GRACE	Would you let me ride your horse?
L258448	u5679	m376	JOE	Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
L258447	u5678	m376	GRACE	Why do you always wear that hat?
L258314	u5679	m376	JOE	Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
L258313	u5678	m376	GRACE	Don't you go to school?
L258842	u5684	m376	TOM	Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
L258841	u5678	m376	GRACE	No!
L258840	u5684	m376	TOM	He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
L258839	u5678	m376	GRACE	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
L258838	u5684	m376	TOM	Grace, I need you to come with me.
L258826	u5678	m376	GRACE	I want to watch.
L258825	u5684	m376	TOM	It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
L258824	u5678	m376	GRACE	What does that mean?
L258823	u5684	m376	TOM	There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
L258820	u5678	m376	GRACE	Sure.
L258819	u5684	m376	TOM	Sure?
L258740	u5684	m376	TOM	There's no hurry. Take you time.
L258739	u5678	m376	GRACE	I can't... not yet...
L258737	u5684	m376	TOM	I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
L258736	u5678	m376	GRACE	I know where he goes.
L258735	u5684	m376	TOM	I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
L258546	u5684	m376	TOM	Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
L258545	u5678	m376	GRACE	Are you afraid of anything?
L258544	u5684	m376	TOM	That must have been pretty special.
L258543	u5678	m376	GRACE	We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
L258542	u5684	m376	TOM	Where did you get Pilgrim from?
L258541	u5684	m376	TOM	Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
L258540	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't know if I can.
L258539	u5684	m376	TOM	Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
L258536	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
L258535	u5678	m376	GRACE	I don't know if I can with my leg.
L258534	u5684	m376	TOM	Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
L258533	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't have all day.
L258532	u5678	m376	GRACE	I can't...
L258531	u5684	m376	TOM	It's never too soon to start.
L258530	u5678	m376	GRACE	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
L258529	u5684	m376	TOM	Can you drive?
L258409	u5684	m376	TOM	You're catching on.
L258408	u5678	m376	GRACE	That's not a question, is it?
L258271	u5684	m376	TOM	Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
L258270	u5678	m376	GRACE	Isn't it like, obvious?
L258256	u5678	m376	GRACE	Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
L258255	u5684	m376	TOM	Mmm. An editor.
L258254	u5678	m376	GRACE	She's an editor.
L258253	u5684	m376	TOM	What does she do?
L258252	u5678	m376	GRACE	Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
L258251	u5684	m376	TOM	She gonna be long?
L258248	u5684	m376	TOM	Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
L258247	u5678	m376	GRACE	Yeah?
L257901	u5680	m376	JUDITH	I'm okay... I'm okay.
L257900	u5678	m376	GRACE	Jude, you okay?
L257894	u5678	m376	GRACE	No, wait, it just goes... he said he liked to do-""..."
L257893	u5680	m376	JUDITH	... and I said that...
L257875	u5680	m376	JUDITH	We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
L257874	u5678	m376	GRACE	You want to go down or stay along the river?
L257873	u5680	m376	JUDITH	Why don't we just cut through the woods?
L257872	u5678	m376	GRACE	Do you want to go around by the old road?
L257871	u5680	m376	JUDITH	I just could never say it!
L257870	u5678	m376	GRACE	...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
L257851	u5678	m376	GRACE	Can I come? I'll start a fire...
L257850	u5680	m376	JUDITH	My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
L257849	u5678	m376	GRACE	So?
L257848	u5680	m376	JUDITH	I thought your mom's coming up?
L257847	u5678	m376	GRACE	You want to go to a movie tonight?
L257846	u5680	m376	JUDITH	It's warmer than I thought.
L258869	u5678	m376	GRACE	I did. He said he had work to do until late.
L258868	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
L258773	u5678	m376	GRACE	Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
L258772	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I know. Amazing.
L258771	u5678	m376	GRACE	Did you notice -- no cane?
L258019	u5678	m376	GRACE	I want to see Pilgrim.
L258018	u5682	m376	ROBERT	What, sweetheart?
L258000	u5678	m376	GRACE	NO!
L257999	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
L257993	u5678	m376	GRACE	Maybe... look -- just...
L257992	u5682	m376	ROBERT	You want to watch some television?
L257989	u5678	m376	GRACE	No, I'm just not that hungry.
L257988	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
L257986	u5682	m376	ROBERT	OK, OK.
L257985	u5678	m376	GRACE	Dad! I can do it, OK?!
L257980	u5678	m376	GRACE	How's Pilgrim doing?
L257979	u5682	m376	ROBERT	No, not yet.
L257978	u5678	m376	GRACE	Have you heard from Judith's parents?
L258660	u5685	m376	TWIN	You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
L258659	u5679	m376	JOE	You shut up, stupid!
L258658	u5685	m376	TWIN	You just showing off for her!
L258657	u5679	m376	JOE	Don't be such a baby!
L258654	u5685	m376	TWIN	WAS SO!
L258653	u5679	m376	JOE	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
L258652	u5685	m376	TWIN	IT WAS MY TURN!
L258790	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
L258789	u5684	m376	TOM	Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
L258785	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I understand...
L258784	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
L258783	u5682	m376	ROBERT	How much longer do you think?
L258782	u5684	m376	TOM	We still have a way to go.
L258781	u5682	m376	ROBERT	I can't believe it's the same horse.
L258769	u5684	m376	TOM	Oh yeah...
L258768	u5682	m376	ROBERT	Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
L258077	u5683	m376	RONA	Honey... I was always good.
L258076	u5684	m376	TOM	You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
L258074	u5684	m376	TOM	Sometimes.
L258073	u5683	m376	RONA	Does a horse miss a saddle?
L258072	u5684	m376	TOM	You ever miss it?
L258071	u5683	m376	RONA	Long enough.
L258070	u5684	m376	TOM	How long were you married?
L258069	u5683	m376	RONA	What are you looking at, young man?
L258068	u5683	m376	RONA	The number's by the phone.
L258067	u5684	m376	TOM	I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
L258066	u5683	m376	RONA	Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
L258042	u5684	m376	TOM	Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
L258041	u5683	m376	RONA	Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
L258040	u5684	m376	TOM	If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
L258039	u5683	m376	RONA	Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
L258038	u5684	m376	TOM	You're looking fit.
L258037	u5683	m376	RONA	I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
L258036	u5684	m376	TOM	Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
L258035	u5683	m376	RONA	Hey, darlin'.
L258065	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
L258064	u5686	m376	WOMAN	What do you mean?
L258063	u5684	m376	TOM	Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
L258062	u5686	m376	WOMAN	About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
L258061	u5684	m376	TOM	What stuff is that?
L258060	u5686	m376	WOMAN	Where did you learn all this stuff?
L258059	u5684	m376	TOM	Well, that'll happen.
L354056	u6345	m423	PALOMA	It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
L354055	u6322	m423	AMADO	So?
L354054	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
L354053	u6322	m423	AMADO	Just shut up.
L354052	u6345	m423	PALOMA	And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
L354051	u6322	m423	AMADO	I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
L354050	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
L354049	u6322	m423	AMADO	I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
L354048	u6345	m423	PALOMA	You jerk--
L354425	u6322	m423	AMADO	Catholic school, nasty.
L354424	u6347	m423	PILAR	Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
L354423	u6322	m423	AMADO	And what did she do?
L354422	u6347	m423	PILAR	I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
L354421	u6322	m423	AMADO	It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
L354420	u6347	m423	PILAR	If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
L354419	u6322	m423	AMADO	Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
L354418	u6347	m423	PILAR	That isn't true.
L354417	u6322	m423	AMADO	I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
L354416	u6347	m423	PILAR	I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
L354415	u6322	m423	AMADO	You think I can't learn that?
L354414	u6347	m423	PILAR	You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
L354413	u6322	m423	AMADO	I can fix cars.
L354412	u6347	m423	PILAR	How do you think you're going to make a living?
L354411	u6347	m423	PILAR	Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
L354410	u6322	m423	AMADO	They stole our land--
L354409	u6347	m423	PILAR	That makes it okay?
L354408	u6322	m423	AMADO	Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
L354407	u6347	m423	PILAR	Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
L354406	u6322	m423	AMADO	They're not going to jail.
L354405	u6347	m423	PILAR	So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
L354404	u6322	m423	AMADO	So?
L354403	u6347	m423	PILAR	--you're going to be on your own.
L354402	u6322	m423	AMADO	I can't take any more school.
L354401	u6347	m423	PILAR	I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
L354047	u6322	m423	AMADO	You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
L354046	u6347	m423	PILAR	Leave your sister out of it.
L354045	u6322	m423	AMADO	Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
L354044	u6347	m423	PILAR	Oh, come on, Amado--
L354043	u6322	m423	AMADO	If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
L353854	u6347	m423	PILAR	You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.

L354614	u6323	m423	ATHENA	No, sir--
L354613	u6332	m423	DEL	Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
L353963	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Thank you, Sergeant Major.
L353962	u6330	m423	CLIFF	You're dismissed.
L353961	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Thank you, Sergeant Major.
L353960	u6330	m423	CLIFF	If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
L353959	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Will this go on my record?
L353958	u6330	m423	CLIFF	He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
L353957	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Out of the Army?
L353954	u6330	m423	CLIFF	He'll live.
L353953	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
L353952	u6323	m423	ATHENA	I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
L353951	u6330	m423	CLIFF	It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
L353944	u6323	m423	ATHENA	From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
L353943	u6330	m423	CLIFF	So you knew this young man before?
L354316	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Yes, Sergeant.
L354315	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
L354314	u6323	m423	ATHENA	You're testing me?
L354313	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
L354312	u6323	m423	ATHENA	I'm feeling okay--
L354311	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
L354310	u6323	m423	ATHENA	Sergeant?
L354309	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Private Johnson!
L353950	u6323	m423	ATHENA	I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
L353949	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	We're not running a dating service here.
L353948	u6323	m423	ATHENA	We were just dancing--
L353947	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	And you and Private Graves--
L353946	u6323	m423	ATHENA	If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
L353945	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Did you know he was going to be there last night?
L353906	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
L353905	u6324	m423	BEN	What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
L353904	u6351	m423	SAM	You got to investigate. No question about it.
L353903	u6324	m423	BEN	If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
L353902	u6351	m423	SAM	So is Buddy on your short list?
L353901	u6324	m423	BEN	Just wondering.
L353900	u6351	m423	SAM	He swore by it.  What?
L353899	u6324	m423	BEN	A .45--
L353898	u6351	m423	SAM	Colt Peacemaker.
L353897	u6324	m423	BEN	You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
L353896	u6351	m423	SAM	So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
L353895	u6324	m423	BEN	Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
L353894	u6351	m423	SAM	You got a cause of death?
L353893	u6324	m423	BEN	Everybody on the border knows that story.
L353892	u6351	m423	SAM	You know the popular version of how he left town.
L353891	u6324	m423	BEN	Yeah.
L353890	u6351	m423	SAM	--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
L353889	u6324	m423	BEN	That badge--
L353888	u6351	m423	SAM	Charley Wade.
L353887	u6324	m423	BEN	Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
L353886	u6351	m423	SAM	Nice job.
L353885	u6324	m423	BEN	We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
L353884	u6351	m423	SAM	Skinny?
L353883	u6324	m423	BEN	Yeah, this is Skinny.
L353882	u6351	m423	SAM	That the word on our boy?
L353881	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
L353880	u6324	m423	BEN	Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
L353879	u6351	m423	SAM	September '97, that's all she wrote.
L353878	u6324	m423	BEN	I hear they're closing that post down.
L353877	u6351	m423	SAM	Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
L353876	u6324	m423	BEN	How's business?
L353875	u6351	m423	SAM	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
L353874	u6324	m423	BEN	Sam the Man.
L353765	u6325	m423	BUDDY	Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
L353764	u6353	m423	WADE	You little pissant--
L353763	u6325	m423	BUDDY	There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
L353762	u6353	m423	WADE	You're fired. You're outta the department.
L353761	u6325	m423	BUDDY	Whole different story; isn't it?
L353760	u6353	m423	WADE	Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
L353759	u6325	m423	BUDDY	You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
L353757	u6353	m423	WADE	You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
L353756	u6325	m423	BUDDY	I'm not picking it up.
L353755	u6353	m423	WADE	You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
L353754	u6325	m423	BUDDY	That's not the point.
L353753	u6353	m423	WADE	There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
L353752	u6325	m423	BUDDY	It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
L353748	u6353	m423	WADE	"I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is ""Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."""
L353747	u6325	m423	BUDDY	So?
L353746	u6353	m423	WADE	Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
L353745	u6325	m423	BUDDY	What's that for?
L354691	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
L354690	u6351	m423	SAM	You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
L354689	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"I only got my little girl now, he says, ""she's my lifeline."" Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people."
L354688	u6351	m423	SAM	I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
L354687	u6326	m423	BUNNY	This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
L354686	u6351	m423	SAM	What?
L354685	u6326	m423	BUNNY	350 pounds.
L354683	u6326	m423	BUNNY	No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
L354682	u6351	m423	SAM	It wasn't just you, Bunny.
L354681	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
L354680	u6351	m423	SAM	Suppose not.
L354679	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
L354678	u6351	m423	SAM	You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
L354677	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
L354676	u6351	m423	SAM	No. You?
L354675	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Least he never called me that. With me, it was always ""high-strung."" ""My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung."" Or ""tightly wound,"" that was another one. You seeing anyone?"
L354674	u6351	m423	SAM	Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
L354673	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says ""Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now""."
L354672	u6351	m423	SAM	Best part of the job.
L354671	u6326	m423	BUNNY	You look awful good in that uniform, though.
L354670	u6351	m423	SAM	Same weight I always was.
L354669	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Daddy calls it an ""altercation."" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny."
L354668	u6351	m423	SAM	You were in a fight--
L354667	u6326	m423	BUNNY	--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
L354666	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, well--
L354665	u6326	m423	BUNNY	--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
L354664	u6351	m423	SAM	You look good--
L354663	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
L354662	u6351	m423	SAM	No, you look good. I was just wondering.
L354661	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Do I seem jumpy?
L354660	u6351	m423	SAM	Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
L354659	u6326	m423	BUNNY	"Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6"", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?"
L354658	u6351	m423	SAM	You still going to all the home games?
L354657	u6351	m423	SAM	Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
L354656	u6326	m423	BUNNY	Oh. Right. And you're in--?
L354655	u6351	m423	SAM	That's in Maverick County.
L354654	u6326	m423	BUNNY	The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
L354719	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	He never asked her.
L354718	u6332	m423	DEL	My mother said he never asked about--
L354717	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
L354716	u6332	m423	DEL	It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
L354715	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
L354714	u6332	m423	DEL	I'm a colonel.
L354713	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
L354712	u6332	m423	DEL	Uncle Al--
L354711	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
L354710	u6332	m423	DEL	Where'd he get all this?
L354706	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
L354705	u6332	m423	DEL	I never met her.
L354704	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
L354703	u6332	m423	DEL	You've been in this house for a while?
L354700	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Come on in.
L354699	u6332	m423	DEL	If it's too late--
L354698	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Come on in--
L354697	u6332	m423	DEL	Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
L354696	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	Hey, it's the General.
L354199	u6327	m423	CAROLYN	So that's him--
L354198	u6332	m423	DEL	You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
L354612	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
L354611	u6328	m423	CHET	My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
L354610	u6344	m423	OTIS	By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
L354609	u6328	m423	CHET	So I'm part-Indian?
L354608	u6344	m423	OTIS	These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
L354607	u6328	m423	CHET	So how come you got into all this?
L354606	u6344	m423	OTIS	When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
L354605	u6328	m423	CHET	He's still pissed off about it.
L354604	u6344	m423	OTIS	Didn't have a father?
L354603	u6328	m423	CHET	I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
L354602	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well--
L354601	u6328	m423	CHET	Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
L354600	u6344	m423	OTIS	PDA?
L354599	u6328	m423	CHET	No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
L354598	u6344	m423	OTIS	He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
L354597	u6328	m423	CHET	Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
L354596	u6344	m423	OTIS	You didn't go telling your father you were here?
L354595	u6328	m423	CHET	That guy who got shot--
L354594	u6344	m423	OTIS	I got a pretty good guess.
L354593	u6328	m423	CHET	You know who I am?
L354592	u6344	m423	OTIS	They were in the Army. Like your father.
L354591	u6328	m423	CHET	But they were Indians themselves.
L354590	u6344	m423	OTIS	Same as they done in Mexico.
L354589	u6328	m423	CHET	They fought against the Indians?
L354588	u6344	m423	OTIS	Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
L354587	u6344	m423	OTIS	They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
L354586	u6328	m423	CHET	So they stayed in Florida?
L354585	u6344	m423	OTIS	They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
L354584	u6328	m423	CHET	The Trail of Tears.
L354583	u6344	m423	OTIS	He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
L354582	u6344	m423	OTIS	Both.
L354581	u6328	m423	CHET	He a Black man or an Indian?
L354580	u6344	m423	OTIS	Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
L353795	u6344	m423	OTIS	Go out through the back.
L353794	u6328	m423	CHET	No sir.
L353793	u6344	m423	OTIS	You weren't in here tonight, were you?
L354792	u6328	m423	CHET	Cool.
L354791	u6332	m423	DEL	Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.

L354783	u6332	m423	DEL	No.
L354782	u6328	m423	CHET	You wouldn't?
L354781	u6332	m423	DEL	Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
L354777	u6332	m423	DEL	So you're going into the Army?
L354776	u6328	m423	CHET	You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.

L354440	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
L354439	u6351	m423	SAM	Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
L354438	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?

L354434	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	Something like that.
L354433	u6351	m423	SAM	Made some money, came back here--
L354432	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	Fifteen years in El Paso.
L354431	u6351	m423	SAM	You lived in the States for a while?
L354430	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
L354429	u6351	m423	SAM	You own this place?
L354428	u6329	m423	CHUCHO	Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
L354248	u6330	m423	CLIFF	What's it doing on a rifle range?
L354247	u6341	m423	MIKEY	They were using M-1's, yeah--
L354246	u6330	m423	CLIFF	This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
L354245	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Yeah?
L354244	u6330	m423	CLIFF	It's a .45.
L354243	u6341	m423	MIKEY	What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
L354242	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Mikey look at this--
L354241	u6341	m423	MIKEY	If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
L354240	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Mikey--
L354239	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
L354238	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Mikey--
L354237	u6341	m423	MIKEY	I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
L354236	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Hey, Mikey--
L354235	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
L354234	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
L354233	u6341	m423	MIKEY	You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
L354232	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Maybe.
L354231	u6341	m423	MIKEY	You going to get married?
L354230	u6330	m423	CLIFF	I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
L354229	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
L353873	u6330	m423	CLIFF	You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
L353872	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
L353860	u6341	m423	MIKEY	We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
L353859	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
L353688	u6341	m423	MIKEY	He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
L353687	u6330	m423	CLIFF	The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
L353675	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Cliff--
L353674	u6330	m423	CLIFF	You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
L353673	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Cliff--
L353672	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
L353671	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
L353670	u6330	m423	CLIFF	It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
L353669	u6341	m423	MIKEY	You finding lots of cactus and shit?
L353668	u6330	m423	CLIFF	I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
L353667	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Right.
L353666	u6330	m423	CLIFF	It's a lead mine.
L353665	u6341	m423	MIKEY	What?
L353664	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Lead mine.
L353663	u6341	m423	MIKEY	This place is a gold mine.
L354161	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	You know who it was they dug up?
L354160	u6330	m423	CLIFF	They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
L354151	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
L354150	u6330	m423	CLIFF	I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
L354149	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
L354148	u6330	m423	CLIFF	You could take it--
L354147	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
L354146	u6330	m423	CLIFF	We should just do it.
L354145	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	We been through this before--
L354144	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Seriously, I think we should get married.
L354143	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	Seriously.
L354142	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
L354141	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	So where does that put us?
L353967	u6330	m423	CLIFF	She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
L353966	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
L353965	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
L353964	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	You spoil 'em, Cliff.
L353956	u6330	m423	CLIFF	He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
L353955	u6348	m423	PRISCILLA	He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
L354155	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
L354154	u6351	m423	SAM	Pleased to meet you.
L354153	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
L353686	u6330	m423	CLIFF	Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
L353685	u6351	m423	SAM	Treasure hunter?
L353684	u6351	m423	SAM	Masons been around a long while.
L353683	u6330	m423	CLIFF	That ring--
L353682	u6351	m423	SAM	I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
L353681	u6330	m423	CLIFF	This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
L353680	u6351	m423	SAM	I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
L354140	u6331	m423	CODY	Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
L354139	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. I bet he would.
L354138	u6331	m423	CODY	--but just as a kind of safety tip.
L354137	u6331	m423	CODY	--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
L354135	u6331	m423	CODY	Take that pair over in the corner--
L354134	u6351	m423	SAM	You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
L354133	u6331	m423	CODY	You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
L354132	u6351	m423	SAM	Good deal you were born down here, then.
L354131	u6331	m423	CODY	--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
L354130	u6351	m423	SAM	If the next guy's a redneck.
L354129	u6331	m423	CODY	Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
L353871	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Appreciate it, sir.
L353870	u6332	m423	DEL	I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
L353866	u6332	m423	DEL	I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
L353865	u6341	m423	MIKEY	Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
L353864	u6332	m423	DEL	Substance abuse?
L353863	u6341	m423	MIKEY	You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
L353858	u6332	m423	DEL	Have we had trouble there before?
L353857	u6341	m423	MIKEY	There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
L354197	u6344	m423	OTIS	Because I'm your father.
L354196	u6332	m423	DEL	Why would you want to do that?
L354195	u6344	m423	OTIS	I gonna meet that family of yours?
L354194	u6344	m423	OTIS	A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
L354193	u6332	m423	DEL	And people make their choice--
L354192	u6344	m423	OTIS	Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
L354191	u6332	m423	DEL	I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
L354190	u6344	m423	OTIS	Right.
L354189	u6332	m423	DEL	The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
L354188	u6344	m423	OTIS	I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
L354187	u6332	m423	DEL	That's right.
L354186	u6344	m423	OTIS	Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
L354185	u6332	m423	DEL	We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
L354184	u6344	m423	OTIS	Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
L354183	u6332	m423	DEL	I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
L354182	u6344	m423	OTIS	This is an official visit, then--
L354181	u6332	m423	DEL	So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
L354180	u6344	m423	OTIS	So.
L354178	u6332	m423	DEL	Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
L354177	u6344	m423	OTIS	This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
L354176	u6344	m423	OTIS	If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
L354175	u6332	m423	DEL	Deal drugs in the bathroom--
L354174	u6344	m423	OTIS	It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
L354173	u6332	m423	DEL	You get much of that in here?
L354172	u6344	m423	OTIS	That's where he fell.
L354171	u6332	m423	DEL	That where he was shot?
L354170	u6344	m423	OTIS	Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
L354169	u6332	m423	DEL	Black Seminoles?
L354463	u6353	m423	WADE	Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
L354462	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
L354461	u6353	m423	WADE	You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
L354460	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Protection?
L354459	u6353	m423	WADE	There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
L354458	u6353	m423	WADE	Bandidos, Injuns--
L354457	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Reputation?
L354456	u6353	m423	WADE	You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
L354455	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Eladio Cruz.
L354454	u6353	m423	WADE	This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
L354453	u6333	m423	ELADIO	I haven't seen anybody doing that.
L354452	u6353	m423	WADE	I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
L354451	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
L354450	u6353	m423	WADE	What's in the back?
L354449	u6333	m423	ELADIO	No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
L354448	u6353	m423	WADE	Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
L354765	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

L354763	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Como se llama? [What's your name?]
L354762	u6333	m423	ELADIO	No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
L354761	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
L354760	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
L354759	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
L354758	u6333	m423	ELADIO	Aqui! [Here!]
L354757	u6355	m423	YOUNG MERCEDES	Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
L354770	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
L354769	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
L354768	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
L354767	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
L354766	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!

L354753	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	This girl has a child?
L354752	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--

L354163	u6334	m423	ENRIQUE	Es muy lindo, su coche--
L353781	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
L353780	u6335	m423	FENTON	Your mother was a saint.
L353772	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
L353771	u6335	m423	FENTON	Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
L353770	u6335	m423	FENTON	That Buddy was a cool breeze.
L353769	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Mas cerveza por favor.
L353742	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
L353741	u6335	m423	FENTON	'57, 1 believe--
L353740	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
L353737	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
L353736	u6335	m423	FENTON	Tell that one, Hollis--
L353733	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
L353732	u6335	m423	FENTON	They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
L353726	u6335	m423	FENTON	Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
L353725	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
L353724	u6335	m423	FENTON	Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
L353721	u6335	m423	FENTON	Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
L353720	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
L353718	u6335	m423	FENTON	He was a unique individual.
L353717	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
L353714	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	"He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. ""Old Fishbait,"" he says, ""never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."""
L353713	u6335	m423	FENTON	Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
L353712	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	"Fishbait, says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, ""What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?"" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, ""C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"""
L354227	u6351	m423	SAM	When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
L354226	u6336	m423	H.L.	When we backed you--
L354223	u6351	m423	SAM	We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
L354222	u6336	m423	H.L.	Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
L354219	u6351	m423	SAM	We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
L354218	u6336	m423	H.L.	That's a matter of interpretation--
L354217	u6351	m423	SAM	We don't need a new jail.
L354216	u6336	m423	H.L.	Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
L354211	u6351	m423	SAM	Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
L354210	u6336	m423	H.L.	That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
L354205	u6336	m423	H.L.	Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
L354204	u6351	m423	SAM	Seems like we have another one every week.
L354203	u6336	m423	H.L.	Historic occasion, isn't it?
L354816	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
L354815	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
L354812	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
L354811	u6351	m423	SAM	And the ten thousand?
L354810	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
L354805	u6351	m423	SAM	Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
L354804	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Buddy Deeds--
L354803	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
L354802	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
L354801	u6351	m423	SAM	Imonna find out one way or the other.
L354796	u6351	m423	SAM	Open late.
L354795	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Hey, Sam.
L354794	u6351	m423	SAM	Fellas.
L354578	u6351	m423	SAM	I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
L354577	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
L354576	u6351	m423	SAM	I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
L354575	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Do you?
L354574	u6351	m423	SAM	I got an idea what happened.
L354573	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
L354572	u6351	m423	SAM	Charley Wade.
L354571	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We have a murder?
L354570	u6351	m423	SAM	You thought any more about our murder?
L354569	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
L354568	u6351	m423	SAM	Morning, Hollis.
L353939	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	And I understand why you might want to think he could.
L353938	u6351	m423	SAM	People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
L353937	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
L353936	u6351	m423	SAM	And Buddy was one of them.
L353935	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
L353934	u6351	m423	SAM	Besides my father, I mean.
L353933	u6351	m423	SAM	Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
L353932	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
L353931	u6351	m423	SAM	He still living?
L353930	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
L353929	u6351	m423	SAM	Bledso
L353928	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
L353927	u6351	m423	SAM	You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
L353926	u6351	m423	SAM	All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
L353925	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
L353924	u6351	m423	SAM	You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
L353923	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
L353922	u6351	m423	SAM	We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
L353921	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
L353920	u6351	m423	SAM	No.
L353919	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	You go by your old house?
L353918	u6351	m423	SAM	I haven't been out here for a while.
L353917	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
L353916	u6351	m423	SAM	Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
L353915	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
L353914	u6351	m423	SAM	I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
L353779	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
L353778	u6351	m423	SAM	Right.
L353777	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
L353774	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
L353773	u6351	m423	SAM	Never heard from him again?
L353735	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
L353734	u6351	m423	SAM	That so?
L353731	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
L353730	u6351	m423	SAM	--Santiago.
L353729	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
L353723	u6337	m423	HOLLIS	Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
L353722	u6351	m423	SAM	I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
L354225	u6351	m423	SAM	Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
L354224	u6338	m423	JORGE	There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
L354221	u6351	m423	SAM	It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
L354220	u6338	m423	JORGE	There was a mandate in the last election--
L354215	u6351	m423	SAM	Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
L354214	u6338	m423	JORGE	He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
L354213	u6351	m423	SAM	The Perdido thing?
L354212	u6338	m423	JORGE	I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
L354209	u6351	m423	SAM	"You ought to put up a banner-- ""Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy""--"
L354208	u6338	m423	JORGE	Sam--
L354207	u6351	m423	SAM	People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
L354206	u6338	m423	JORGE	We're building up tourism, Sam--
L354510	u6339	m423	MARISOL	You told me one time it was true love.
L354509	u6347	m423	PILAR	I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
L354508	u6339	m423	MARISOL	The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
L354507	u6347	m423	PILAR	The Sheriff.
L354506	u6339	m423	MARISOL	How 'bout the Sheriff?
L354505	u6347	m423	PILAR	All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
L354504	u6339	m423	MARISOL	You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
L354503	u6347	m423	PILAR	Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
L354502	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Your mother's family is Spanish?
L354501	u6347	m423	PILAR	Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
L354500	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
L354499	u6347	m423	PILAR	Steve?
L354498	u6339	m423	MARISOL	Steve called for you.
L354124	u6347	m423	PILAR	That boy--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
L354123	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I never said that. It was just that boy--
L354122	u6347	m423	PILAR	What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
L354121	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I felt that you could do better for yourself--
L354120	u6347	m423	PILAR	You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
L354119	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I never said that.
L354118	u6347	m423	PILAR	"Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- ""some chulo with grease under his nails."""
L354117	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I don't mean Fernando.
L354116	u6347	m423	PILAR	Thank you.
L354115	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
L354114	u6347	m423	PILAR	Nobody's too busy.
L354113	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	I was too busy.
L354112	u6347	m423	PILAR	There must have been somebody.
L354111	u6347	m423	PILAR	How come you never got married again?
L354110	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	A little older than Paloma is now.
L354109	u6347	m423	PILAR	Right. When he was killed.
L354108	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	He was killed.
L354107	u6347	m423	PILAR	Mami, how old were you when my father--
L354106	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
L354105	u6347	m423	PILAR	Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
L354104	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Why would I want to go there?
L354103	u6347	m423	PILAR	No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
L354102	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
L354101	u6347	m423	PILAR	If you spent a little more time training them--
L354100	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
L354099	u6347	m423	PILAR	Well, you hire illegals--
L354098	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
L354097	u6347	m423	PILAR	Maybe you're just getting less patient.
L354096	u6340	m423	MERCEDES	These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
L353991	u6351	m423	SAM	Do you remember the last time you saw him?
L353990	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
L353989	u6351	m423	SAM	People didn't complain?
L353988	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
L353987	u6351	m423	SAM	And my father?
L353986	u6342	m423	MINNIE	"Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, ""Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership."" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime."
L353985	u6351	m423	SAM	He squeezed money out of you?
L353984	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
L353983	u6351	m423	SAM	You had to deal with him in running the club.
L353982	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Not if I can help it.
L353981	u6351	m423	SAM	So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
L353980	u6342	m423	MINNIE	We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
L353979	u6351	m423	SAM	He had the club out on the old trail road--
L353978	u6342	m423	MINNIE	I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
L353977	u6351	m423	SAM	You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
L353976	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
L353975	u6351	m423	SAM	I've seen 'em.
L353974	u6342	m423	MINNIE	You ever play one of these?
L353973	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah, that's the story of my life.
L353972	u6342	m423	MINNIE	Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
L353971	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm Sheriff Deeds--
L353970	u6342	m423	MINNIE	That's me.
L353969	u6351	m423	SAM	Mrs. Bledsoe?
L354496	u6347	m423	PILAR	I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
L354495	u6343	m423	MOLLY	I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
L354494	u6347	m423	PILAR	I don't think you can take it personally--
L353705	u6347	m423	PILAR	He's going to wish he was dead.
L353704	u6343	m423	MOLLY	No. Is he sick?
L353703	u6347	m423	PILAR	Okay? He's not here?
L353702	u6343	m423	MOLLY	Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
L354799	u6344	m423	OTIS	Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
L354798	u6351	m423	SAM	Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
L354797	u6344	m423	OTIS	I'm not open. We were just talking.
L354041	u6351	m423	SAM	He ever accept cash for a favor?
L354040	u6344	m423	OTIS	Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
L354039	u6351	m423	SAM	What was your deal with him?
L354038	u6344	m423	OTIS	What about it?
L354037	u6351	m423	SAM	And when my father was Sheriff?
L354036	u6344	m423	OTIS	Could of been. That was white people's business.
L354035	u6351	m423	SAM	That was the night he disappeared?
L354034	u6344	m423	OTIS	Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
L354033	u6351	m423	SAM	And that was the last time you saw him?
L354032	u6344	m423	OTIS	I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
L354566	u6347	m423	PILAR	Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
L354565	u6345	m423	PALOMA	How come?
L354564	u6347	m423	PILAR	I only went for my last two years.
L354563	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
L354562	u6347	m423	PILAR	Enough with the clothes--
L354561	u6345	m423	PALOMA	I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
L354560	u6347	m423	PILAR	Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
L354559	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Can I get this?
L354558	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
L354557	u6345	m423	PALOMA	You got in late last night.
L354556	u6347	m423	PILAR	It's Saturday.
L354555	u6345	m423	PALOMA	She finally got in--
L354351	u6347	m423	PILAR	What do you think?
L354350	u6345	m423	PALOMA	What's she singing about?
L354349	u6347	m423	PILAR	For a while.
L354348	u6345	m423	PALOMA	You gonna stay out here?
L354347	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah?
L354346	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Mom?
L354060	u6347	m423	PILAR	It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
L354059	u6345	m423	PALOMA	What?
L354058	u6347	m423	PILAR	Of course you can.
L354057	u6345	m423	PALOMA	Not if you have half a brain in your head.
L354378	u6346	m423	PETE	Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
L354377	u6351	m423	SAM	Murdered him?
L354376	u6346	m423	PETE	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
L354375	u6351	m423	SAM	I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
L354374	u6346	m423	PETE	Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
L354373	u6351	m423	SAM	You built our patio while you  were on the county?
L354372	u6346	m423	PETE	It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
L354371	u6351	m423	SAM	Well, you were working there--
L354370	u6346	m423	PETE	And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
L354369	u6351	m423	SAM	So I've heard--
L354368	u6346	m423	PETE	He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
L354367	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm surprised he bothered with it.
L354366	u6346	m423	PETE	That's how I ruined my stomach.
L354365	u6346	m423	PETE	Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
L354364	u6351	m423	SAM	I thought he busted you a couple times.
L354363	u6346	m423	PETE	Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
L354362	u6346	m423	PETE	I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
L354361	u6351	m423	SAM	You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
L354360	u6346	m423	PETE	It was for personal consumption.
L354359	u6351	m423	SAM	You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
L354358	u6346	m423	PETE	Three months.
L354357	u6351	m423	SAM	How much you got left?
L354356	u6346	m423	PETE	Time marches on.
L354355	u6351	m423	SAM	Hey, Pete. How's it going?
L354354	u6346	m423	PETE	Morning, Sheriff.
L354836	u6347	m423	PILAR	Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
L354835	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah--
L354834	u6347	m423	PILAR	We start from scratch--
L354833	u6351	m423	SAM	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
L354832	u6347	m423	PILAR	I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
L354830	u6351	m423	SAM	I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
L354829	u6347	m423	PILAR	From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
L354828	u6351	m423	SAM	"He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you ""our beautiful daughter"" in the letters she wrote to him."
L354827	u6347	m423	PILAR	They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
L354826	u6351	m423	SAM	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
L354825	u6347	m423	PILAR	I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
L354824	u6351	m423	SAM	Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
L354823	u6347	m423	PILAR	Couple months before I was born--
L354822	u6351	m423	SAM	You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
L354821	u6347	m423	PILAR	She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
L354820	u6351	m423	SAM	You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
L354554	u6347	m423	PILAR	Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
L354553	u6351	m423	SAM	What was your father's name?
L354552	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah?
L354551	u6351	m423	SAM	Pilar--
L354550	u6347	m423	PILAR	It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
L354549	u6351	m423	SAM	I've felt that way, yeah.
L354548	u6347	m423	PILAR	Like your story is over.
L354547	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
L354546	u6347	m423	PILAR	There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
L354545	u6351	m423	SAM	Two years.
L354544	u6347	m423	PILAR	How long have you lived here?
L354543	u6351	m423	SAM	More, I hope.
L354542	u6347	m423	PILAR	So what are we gonna do about this?
L354541	u6351	m423	SAM	I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
L354540	u6347	m423	PILAR	How come it feels the same?
L354539	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354538	u6347	m423	PILAR	Wow.
L354536	u6351	m423	SAM	I came back 'cause you were here.
L354535	u6347	m423	PILAR	Yeah?
L354534	u6351	m423	SAM	You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
L354533	u6347	m423	PILAR	When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
L354532	u6351	m423	SAM	Nothing.
L354531	u6347	m423	PILAR	I mean what did we know about anything?
L354530	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354529	u6347	m423	PILAR	I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
L354528	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354527	u6347	m423	PILAR	We thought we were something, didn't we?
L354299	u6347	m423	PILAR	Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
L354298	u6351	m423	SAM	Pilar--
L354297	u6347	m423	PILAR	I should get back.
L354295	u6347	m423	PILAR	They've got me. Different thing.
L354294	u6351	m423	SAM	You've got your mother, your kids--
L354293	u6347	m423	PILAR	It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
L354292	u6351	m423	SAM	I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
L354291	u6347	m423	PILAR	You don't want to be Sheriff.
L354290	u6351	m423	SAM	Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
L354289	u6347	m423	PILAR	So why did you come back here, Sam?
L354288	u6351	m423	SAM	It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
L354287	u6347	m423	PILAR	Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
L354286	u6351	m423	SAM	Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
L354285	u6347	m423	PILAR	With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
L354284	u6351	m423	SAM	No--
L354283	u6347	m423	PILAR	He hates me.
L354282	u6351	m423	SAM	Nice-looking kid.
L354281	u6347	m423	PILAR	Amado.
L354280	u6351	m423	SAM	Your boy, there--
L354279	u6347	m423	PILAR	Weird what you remember.
L354278	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354277	u6347	m423	PILAR	I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
L354276	u6347	m423	PILAR	I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
L354275	u6351	m423	SAM	Most people did, yeah.
L354274	u6347	m423	PILAR	People liked him.
L354273	u6351	m423	SAM	They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
L354272	u6347	m423	PILAR	I thought you got through that pretty well.
L354271	u6347	m423	PILAR	So she tells me three times a week.
L354270	u6351	m423	SAM	She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
L354269	u6347	m423	PILAR	A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
L354268	u6351	m423	SAM	I see she built a place up here by the river.
L354267	u6347	m423	PILAR	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
L354266	u6351	m423	SAM	Your mother still doesn't like me.
L354265	u6351	m423	SAM	Want to take a walk?
L354264	u6347	m423	PILAR	Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
L354263	u6351	m423	SAM	Field trip?
L353852	u6347	m423	PILAR	Are you okay?
L353851	u6351	m423	SAM	He's all yours.
L353839	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
L353838	u6347	m423	PILAR	We haven't talked since high school.
L353837	u6351	m423	SAM	I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
L353836	u6351	m423	SAM	I'll see what's going on.
L353835	u6347	m423	PILAR	Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
L353834	u6351	m423	SAM	Got him here?
L353833	u6347	m423	PILAR	They've got my Amado.
L353832	u6351	m423	SAM	Something wrong?
L354399	u6349	m423	RAY	Well, it's a complicated issue--
L354398	u6351	m423	SAM	You think we need a new jail?
L354397	u6351	m423	SAM	I appreciate you telling me.
L354396	u6349	m423	RAY	I didn't want to be going around your back.
L354395	u6351	m423	SAM	Don't know if I'll still want it.
L354394	u6349	m423	RAY	How 'bout you?
L354393	u6351	m423	SAM	You'd do a good job.
L354392	u6349	m423	RAY	Yeah.
L354391	u6351	m423	SAM	They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
L354390	u6349	m423	RAY	Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
L354389	u6349	m423	RAY	Oh.
L354388	u6351	m423	SAM	Gotta be in person.
L354387	u6349	m423	RAY	They got telephones.
L354386	u6351	m423	SAM	No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
L354385	u6349	m423	RAY	The Republicans?
L354384	u6351	m423	SAM	I'm going over to the other side.
L354383	u6349	m423	RAY	Uh-huh.
L354382	u6351	m423	SAM	I been working on a few things.
L354381	u6349	m423	RAY	Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
L354380	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah.
L354379	u6349	m423	RAY	You're out early.
L353830	u6351	m423	SAM	Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
L353829	u6349	m423	RAY	Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
L353828	u6351	m423	SAM	Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
L353827	u6349	m423	RAY	Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
L353826	u6351	m423	SAM	The shooter local?
L353825	u6349	m423	RAY	Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
L354324	u6352	m423	SHADOW	You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
L354323	u6349	m423	RAY	This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
L354322	u6352	m423	SHADOW	White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
L354321	u6349	m423	RAY	Just doing my job.
L354320	u6352	m423	SHADOW	"You're the one who's a good boy. Man say ""fetch"" and you fetch--"
L354319	u6349	m423	RAY	You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
L354318	u6352	m423	SHADOW	You don't need to cuff me.
L354317	u6349	m423	RAY	Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
L354029	u6353	m423	WADE	And people better clear out of here! Now!
L354028	u6350	m423	RODERICK	This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
L354027	u6353	m423	WADE	What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
L354026	u6350	m423	RODERICK	No, Sheriff, I'm just--
L354025	u6353	m423	WADE	You telling me what to do, Roderick?
L354024	u6350	m423	RODERICK	You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
L354023	u6350	m423	RODERICK	Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
L354022	u6353	m423	WADE	That the problem, son?  You Slow?
L354021	u6350	m423	RODERICK	Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
L354342	u6359	m423	ZACK	The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
L354341	u6351	m423	SAM	Sure.
L354340	u6359	m423	ZACK	I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
L354339	u6351	m423	SAM	Yeah. It's quiet--
L354338	u6359	m423	ZACK	We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
L354337	u6351	m423	SAM	I haven't seen anybody come by.
L354336	u6359	m423	ZACK	We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
L354335	u6351	m423	SAM	What's up?
L354334	u6359	m423	ZACK	Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
L354491	u6354	m423	WESLEY	The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
L354490	u6351	m423	SAM	You know who it was?
L354489	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
L354488	u6351	m423	SAM	Another woman?
L354487	u6354	m423	WESLEY	If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
L354486	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Me neither.
L354485	u6351	m423	SAM	No--
L354484	u6354	m423	WESLEY	They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
L354483	u6351	m423	SAM	You think he killed anybody in Korea?
L354482	u6354	m423	WESLEY	For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
L354481	u6351	m423	SAM	So when did Buddy leave?
L354480	u6354	m423	WESLEY	Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
L354477	u6354	m423	WESLEY	But you don't see much competition, do you?
L354476	u6351	m423	SAM	Hell of a spot to put a business.
L354475	u6354	m423	WESLEY	How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
L354474	u6351	m423	SAM	You sell much out here?
L354473	u6354	m423	WESLEY	--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
L354015	u6353	m423	WADE	Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
L354014	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Been away. Up to Houston.
L354013	u6353	m423	WADE	How come you don't took familiar?
L354009	u6353	m423	WADE	Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
L354008	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Runnin' numbers illegal.
L354007	u6353	m423	WADE	As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
L354005	u6353	m423	WADE	Why you think that was?
L354004	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	I know that.
L354003	u6353	m423	WADE	I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
L354002	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Uh-huh.
L354001	u6353	m423	WADE	One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
L354000	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Payne.
L353999	u6353	m423	WADE	Otis what?
L353998	u6356	m423	YOUNG OTIS	Name's Otis.
L353997	u6353	m423	WADE	I know you?
L354306	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	You believe that?
L354305	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
L354304	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
L354303	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	He's gonna find out.
L354302	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	He doesn't need to know all my business.
L354301	u6357	m423	YOUNG PILAR	You going to tell him?
L354300	u6358	m423	YOUNG SAM	You going to tell her?
L490215	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
L490214	u7527	m509	AARON	Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
L490171	u7527	m509	AARON	You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
L490170	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You askin' me to clear out now?
L490167	u7527	m509	AARON	They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
L490166	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
L490134	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
L490133	u7527	m509	AARON	It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
L490121	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
L490120	u7527	m509	AARON	But Mose Harper said...
L490119	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How should I know?
L490118	u7527	m509	AARON	How's California?
L490272	u7528	m509	BEN	I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
L490271	u7541	m509	MARTHA	What, Ben?
L490270	u7528	m509	BEN	It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
L490144	u7528	m509	BEN	It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
L490143	u7541	m509	MARTHA	Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
L490127	u7541	m509	MARTHA	That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
L490126	u7528	m509	BEN	An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
L490125	u7541	m509	MARTHA	Lucy's going on seventeen now...
L490434	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
L490433	u7529	m509	BRAD	It was, I tell you!
L490432	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What you saw wasn't Lucy.
L490423	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Huh...? No...no water.
L490422	u7529	m509	BRAD	Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
L490413	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
L490412	u7529	m509	BRAD	You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
L490408	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
L490407	u7529	m509	BRAD	They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
L490340	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Why don't you finish the job?
L490339	u7529	m509	BRAD	Let's get along...
L490251	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
L490250	u7529	m509	BRAD	Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
L490913	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	I ain't wearing no gun.
L490912	u7542	m509	MARTIN	It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
L490910	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
L490909	u7542	m509	MARTIN	If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
L490908	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
L490907	u7542	m509	MARTIN	As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
L490906	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
L490905	u7542	m509	MARTIN	<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
L490973	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	Yes sir...
L490972	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
L490934	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
L490933	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
L490923	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
L490922	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	Dunno...Seems so.
L490921	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You all right, sergeant?
L490917	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	In that case, give the boys room...
L490916	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	No sir...pleasure.
L490915	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
L490332	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
L490331	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
L490330	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Another one, eh?
L491005	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
L491004	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I say NO!
L491000	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now mount up, son...
L490999	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
L490996	u7533	m509	ETHAN	There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
L490995	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
L490989	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
L490988	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	How many, would you say?
L490987	u7533	m509	ETHAN	We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
L490930	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
L490929	u7533	m509	ETHAN	This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
L490928	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
L490919	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
L490918	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
L490889	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
L490888	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
L490386	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You got one now!
L490385	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
L490384	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I didn't give any order to fire!
L490371	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	How far's the river from here, Mose?
L490370	u7533	m509	ETHAN	If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
L490365	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Just keep goin'...
L490364	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You got any more orders, Captain?
L490359	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
L490358	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
L490357	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
L490352	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
L490351	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It's what we're here for, ain't it?
L490350	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
L490349	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
L490342	u7533	m509	ETHAN	By what you preach...none!
L490341	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	What good does that do?
L490318	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
L490317	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
L490316	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	He cometh forth like a...
L490224	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
L490223	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You fit a lot of descriptions.
L490222	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Got a warrant?
L490221	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
L490220	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
L490219	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
L490218	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
L490213	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
L490212	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
L490211	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ain't goin'...
L490207	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
L490206	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
L491019	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Yes, sir...
L491018	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
L491017	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
L491016	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
L491015	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	If there's anything I can do, sir...
L491014	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
L491013	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
L491012	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
L491011	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Sir?
L491010	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
L491009	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Captain Clayton...Captain!
L491008	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	What in...?
L490971	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
L490970	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
L490969	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
L490951	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
L490950	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	And what makes you think he's in this territory?
L490947	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
L490946	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	JOINT action?
L490945	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
L490944	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
L490943	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
L490942	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
L490941	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
L490939	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I'm Clayton.
L490938	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
L490841	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
L490840	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I've come now...
L490839	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
L490838	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
L490837	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
L490836	u7542	m509	MARTIN	No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
L490833	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	They have done...nothing...They are my people...
L490832	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
L490828	u7542	m509	MARTIN	We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
L490827	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	Unnt-meah!
L490234	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Grab hold!...
L490233	u7532	m509	DEBBIE	Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
L490963	u7543	m509	MOSE	Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
L490962	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Scar! Where's he holed in?
L490961	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
L490960	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
L490956	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
L490955	u7543	m509	MOSE	Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
L490764	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
L490763	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Told ya, didn't I?
L490762	u7543	m509	MOSE	Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
L490761	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
L490760	u7543	m509	MOSE	Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
L490759	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, the reward still stands...
L490752	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You were born old...
L490751	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
L490750	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
L490382	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
L490381	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
L490363	u7533	m509	ETHAN	SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
L490362	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...They was here...
L490542	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Ain't yours yet.
L490541	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
L490538	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
L490537	u7533	m509	ETHAN	And maybe you lie...
L490536	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
L490535	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Keep talking.
L490534	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
L490533	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
L490532	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
L490531	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Talk!
L490526	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	You got it with you?
L490525	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's what I said.
L490524	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
L490523	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How'd you come by this?
L490708	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
L490707	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
L490706	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
L490703	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
L490702	u7533	m509	ETHAN	My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
L490698	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
L490697	u7535	m509	GENERAL	I beg your pardon?
L490696	u7533	m509	ETHAN	<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
L490695	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
L490998	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
L490997	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
L490994	u7542	m509	MARTIN	She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
L490993	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
L490992	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
L490991	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It's what I'm countin' on.
L490990	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
L490877	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's goin' on?
L490876	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What's that got to do with us?
L490859	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
L490858	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
L490857	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not no more.
L490856	u7542	m509	MARTIN	'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
L490850	u7542	m509	MARTIN	We won't be here...Come on!
L490849	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They'll be back...
L490848	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Over there!
L490847	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Go on! Get out of here while you can...
L490830	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
L490829	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How? She's even forgot her own language!
L490823	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
L490822	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Why didn't he make his move back there?
L490821	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
L490820	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You figger Scar means to kill us?
L490796	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Not likely.
L490795	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stay out here.
L490774	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
L490773	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Never heard of him...
L490772	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
L490770	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
L490769	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Lemme alone...
L490719	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
L490718	u7542	m509	MARTIN	No...She's not...
L490678	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
L490677	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, you're a widower now...
L490667	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
L490666	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
L490665	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
L490663	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's the sense in it!
L490662	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Nine...  Ten!
L490661	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Ethan, quit it!
L490653	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
L490652	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I think maybe we oughta...
L490651	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
L490650	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Think she means for us to follow?
L490649	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
L490648	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
L490643	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
L490642	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ask her!
L490638	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Look?
L490637	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
L490633	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Cut it out, will ya...
L490632	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
L490628	u7533	m509	ETHAN	And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
L490627	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
L490626	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
L490625	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What?
L490624	u7533	m509	ETHAN	<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
L490619	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Think it might be...?
L490618	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
L490616	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Forget it...
L490615	u7542	m509	MARTIN	But I just bought a good blanket.
L490614	u7533	m509	ETHAN	When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
L490613	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Scar?
L490612	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
L490560	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Whatchu doin'?...
L490559	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He just couldn't wait...
L490558	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Futterman?
L490554	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You all settled an' comfortable now?
L490553	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Oh...
L490552	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
L490551	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's that?
L490550	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
L490548	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
L490547	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Hey! What's the idea...?
L490504	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Good night.
L490503	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
L490502	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
L490501	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
L490500	u7542	m509	MARTIN	All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
L490499	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That don't make 'em kin...
L490498	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
L490497	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
L490496	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Because she's my...my...
L490495	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Why?
L490494	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
L490493	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
L490492	u7542	m509	MARTIN	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
L490491	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
L490490	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Good night...
L490489	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Good night...Laurie...
L490446	u7533	m509	ETHAN	An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
L490445	u7542	m509	MARTIN	And you think we got a chance to find her?
L490444	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
L490443	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Say it. We're beat!
L490440	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...

L490425	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
L490424	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You all right, Ethan?
L490418	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
L490417	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You want us to fire a shot if...
L490411	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
L490410	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
L490409	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Easy on that!
L490402	u7533	m509	ETHAN	If they're still alive...
L490401	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
L490400	u7533	m509	ETHAN	All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
L490310	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Leggo...
L490309	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Nothing for you to see.
L490255	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
L490254	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Well, come on!
L490243	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Well, fust off...
L490242	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
L490241	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What you want me to call you?
L490240	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
L490239	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Yes, sir.
L490238	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
L490237	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
L490132	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You've done a lot of growin'...
L490131	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
L490731	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
L490730	u7538	m509	KEEFER	That's the breed...Course it might take time.
L490729	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Comancheros...
L490728	u7538	m509	KEEFER	There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
L490727	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
L490723	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
L490722	u7538	m509	KEEFER	Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
L490721	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not far from it...
L490720	u7538	m509	KEEFER	Was your niece about their age?
L490893	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I've seen her...and she's alive.
L490892	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	You've seen her!...She's alive?
L490891	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's not a little girl any more.
L490483	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...not yet...
L490482	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
L490481	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
L490480	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Why it's just a snip of calico...
L490471	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Don't go blamin' yourself...
L490470	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I got your boy killed.
L490469	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
L490323	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
L490322	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
L490739	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
L490738	u7537	m509	JORGENSEN	They never find that girl.
L490605	u7539	m509	LAURIE	A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
L490604	u7537	m509	JORGENSEN	Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
L490588	u7537	m509	JORGENSEN	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
L490587	u7539	m509	LAURIE	The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
L490586	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
L490585	u7537	m509	JORGENSEN	Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
L490584	u7539	m509	LAURIE	'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
L490583	u7537	m509	JORGENSEN	From the beginning...
L490582	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
L490982	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Only if I'm dead!
L490981	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
L490980	u7542	m509	MARTIN	<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
L490979	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
L490978	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I got to fetch her home...
L490977	u7539	m509	LAURIE	It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
L490976	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You crazy?
L490975	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Martie...don't go! Not this time.
L490903	u7539	m509	LAURIE	You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
L490902	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
L490900	u7539	m509	LAURIE	It isn't fair...
L490899	u7542	m509	MARTIN	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
L490898	u7539	m509	LAURIE	No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
L490897	u7542	m509	MARTIN	It wasn't much of a letter...
L490896	u7539	m509	LAURIE	One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
L490895	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
L490519	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
L490518	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
L490517	u7542	m509	MARTIN	But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.

L635670	u8711	m591	FUZZY	No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
L635669	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	He admit it?
L635668	u8711	m591	FUZZY	Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
L635667	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Alive?
L635666	u8711	m591	FUZZY	We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
L635098	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
L635097	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
L635096	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I could run off them whores.
L635095	u8716	m591	SKINNY	You could run off them two cowboys.
L635094	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	That much, huh?
L635093	u8716	m591	SKINNY	You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
L635092	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	They really got all that money, them whores?
L635091	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
L635090	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
L635089	u8716	m591	SKINNY	I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
L635088	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	All week?
L635087	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Yup.
L635086	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
L635085	u8716	m591	SKINNY	...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
L635084	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
L635083	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
L635082	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Yeah?
L635079	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
L635078	u8716	m591	SKINNY	What's all that wood?
L635077	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
L635076	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Heard you done the roof yourself.
L635075	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
L635074	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Hit your finger, huh?
L634981	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
L634980	u8716	m591	SKINNY	She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
L634979	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
L634978	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
L634977	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
L634976	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Property.
L634975	u8716	m591	SKINNY	This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
L634974	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	No?
L634973	u8716	m591	SKINNY	Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
L635831	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
L635830	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Deserve don't mean shit, Little Bill.
L635829	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
L635808	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
L635807	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
L635806	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
L635460	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
L635459	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
L635458	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Uh... yeah. Yeah.
L635457	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
L635456	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
L635455	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
L635454	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
L635453	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	What's your name?
L635452	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Like I said, I...
L635451	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
L635450	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
L635449	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
L635448	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
L635447	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
L635446	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
L635430	u8719	m591	WW	Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
L635429	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	What?
L635428	u8719	m591	WW	Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
L635427	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
L635426	u8719	m591	WW	Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
L635425	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
L635424	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
L635423	u8719	m591	WW	Did you... kill him?
L635422	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	"Well, Jim, I says, ""it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."""
L635379	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Give it to him.
L635378	u8719	m591	WW	R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
L635372	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
L635371	u8719	m591	WW	Is... is it... loaded?
L635370	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
L635368	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
L635367	u8719	m591	WW	But... if he doesn't miss?
L635366	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
L635365	u8719	m591	WW	But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
L635341	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
L635340	u8719	m591	WW	You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
L635339	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
L635338	u8719	m591	WW	And?
L635337	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
L635336	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	"Some folks did call Old Corky ""Two Gun"" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell."
L635335	u8719	m591	WW	But he was called...
L635334	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
L635333	u8719	m591	WW	You were there?
L635332	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
L635331	u8719	m591	WW	I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
L635330	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	"Duck, I says.  ""You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran,"" said the duck. ""You must apologize."" But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."" "
L635329	u8719	m591	WW	Duke.
L635328	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
L635327	u8719	m591	WW	Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
L635326	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
L635325	u8719	m591	WW	Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
L635323	u8719	m591	WW	Uh... Duke.
L635322	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
L635232	u8719	m591	WW	D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
L635231	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	The... Duck of Death.
L635225	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
L635224	u8719	m591	WW	It's only a b-b-b-book...
L635220	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	Letters?
L635219	u8719	m591	WW	N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
L635218	u8712	m591	LITTLE BILL	You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
L635775	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
L635774	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	N-no, sir?
L635773	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
L635772	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	"He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said ""Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?"" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73."
L635771	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
L635770	u8714	m591	MUNNY	An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
L635769	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
L635768	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Then... what?
L635767	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
L635766	u8714	m591	MUNNY	What'd Ned say?
L635765	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L635764	u8714	m591	MUNNY	The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
L635763	u8714	m591	MUNNY	They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
L635762	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	"In front of Greely's. It says, ""This here is what happens to..."""
L635761	u8714	m591	MUNNY	A sign on him?
L635760	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
L635759	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
L635758	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
L635757	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He hanged him?  Shot him down?
L635756	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
L635755	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Who killed him?
L635754	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
L635753	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
L635752	u8714	m591	MUNNY	No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
L635751	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	He's... he's dead.
L635750	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
L635749	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	Ned's share?
L635745	u8713	m591	LITTLE SUE	Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
L635744	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
L635791	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
L635790	u8717	m591	THE KID	You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
L635789	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
L635788	u8717	m591	THE KID	Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
L635787	u8714	m591	MUNNY	This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
L635785	u8717	m591	THE KID	I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
L635784	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
L635783	u8717	m591	THE KID	You could have it. All of it.
L635782	u8714	m591	MUNNY	You better get on back, Miss.

L635748	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
L635747	u8717	m591	THE KID	I trust you, Bill.

L635742	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.

L635735	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Yeah?
L635734	u8717	m591	THE KID	First one I ever killed.

L635683	u8714	m591	MUNNY	It's gonna get riper yet.
L635639	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Shut up, Kid.
L635638	u8717	m591	THE KID	You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...

L635584	u8714	m591	MUNNY	If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
L635583	u8717	m591	THE KID	What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
L635581	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
L635580	u8717	m591	THE KID	Did you kill him?
L635577	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He got the boy's horse.
L635576	u8717	m591	THE KID	He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
L635575	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Finish him, Ned.
L635360	u8717	m591	THE KID	You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
L635359	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Get some sleep, Kid.
L635351	u8717	m591	THE KID	You don't recollect!
L635350	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well... I don't recollect.
L635349	u8717	m591	THE KID	An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
L635348	u8714	m591	MUNNY	What business?
L635347	u8717	m591	THE KID	Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
L635318	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
L635317	u8717	m591	THE KID	Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
L635316	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
L635297	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Lookin' at?
L635296	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
L635295	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Huh?
L635294	u8717	m591	THE KID	What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
L635291	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
L635290	u8717	m591	THE KID	You're goin' back with him?
L635289	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
L635288	u8717	m591	THE KID	No.
L635287	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Three ways, I figured.
L635279	u8717	m591	THE KID	I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
L635278	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
L635275	u8717	m591	THE KID	Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
L635274	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
L635048	u8717	m591	THE KID	If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
L635047	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I don't never see nobody anyhow.
L635046	u8717	m591	THE KID	Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
L635045	u8717	m591	THE KID	Oh.
L635044	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Been gone near three years now.
L635043	u8717	m591	THE KID	Huh?
L635042	u8714	m591	MUNNY	She's passed on, Kid.
L635041	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
L635040	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
L635037	u8717	m591	THE KID	Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
L635036	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Jesus!
L635035	u8717	m591	THE KID	For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
L635034	u8714	m591	MUNNY	What for?
L635033	u8717	m591	THE KID	Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
L635032	u8714	m591	MUNNY	About what?
L635031	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, how about it?
L635030	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Oh.
L635029	u8717	m591	THE KID	On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
L635028	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Schofield? You from Schofield?
L635027	u8717	m591	THE KID	I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
L635026	u8714	m591	MUNNY	He said that, huh?
L635025	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
L635024	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Maybe I ain't.

L635021	u8717	m591	THE KID	I could of... easy.
L635020	u8714	m591	MUNNY	You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
L635017	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
L635016	u8717	m591	THE KID	You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
L635012	u8717	m591	THE KID	Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
L635011	u8714	m591	MUNNY	William Munny, yeah.
L635827	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I could tell you who was last, mister.
L635826	u8719	m591	WW	Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
L635825	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.

L635813	u8714	m591	MUNNY	You ain't shot.
L635812	u8719	m591	WW	I... I... think I'm... shot.
L635647	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
L635646	u8715	m591	NED	I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
L635645	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
L635644	u8715	m591	NED	Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
L635643	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.

L635135	u8715	m591	NED	Nor Quincy, I guess.
L635134	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
L635133	u8715	m591	NED	You ain't like that no more.
L635132	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
L635131	u8715	m591	NED	You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
L635130	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
L635129	u8715	m591	NED	Well, she...
L635128	u8714	m591	MUNNY	I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
L635127	u8715	m591	NED	It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
L635126	u8714	m591	MUNNY	She gave me the evil eye.
L635125	u8715	m591	NED	Sally?
L635124	u8714	m591	MUNNY	It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
L635123	u8715	m591	NED	Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
L635122	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
L635121	u8714	m591	MUNNY	We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
L635120	u8715	m591	NED	He musta been movin' right along.
L635118	u8715	m591	NED	Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.

L635110	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
L635109	u8715	m591	NED	Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
L635108	u8714	m591	MUNNY	We done stuff before for money, Ned.
L635107	u8715	m591	NED	Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
L635106	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Eleven.
L635105	u8715	m591	NED	How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
L635104	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
L635103	u8715	m591	NED	We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
L635862	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
L635861	u8718	m591	WILL	I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
L635860	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
L635859	u8718	m591	WILL	N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
L635858	u8714	m591	MUNNY	Who said that?

L635014	u8714	m591	MUNNY	What is it, son?
L635536	u8717	m591	THE KID	Hell, yeah.
L635535	u8715	m591	NED	Yeah?
L635534	u8717	m591	THE KID	I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
L635533	u8715	m591	NED	Just like that?
L635532	u8717	m591	THE KID	I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
L635531	u8715	m591	NED	An' if I spot 'em?
L635530	u8717	m591	THE KID	I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
L635529	u8715	m591	NED	You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
L635528	u8717	m591	THE KID	That ain't what I mean.
L635527	u8715	m591	NED	We'll bury him.
L635526	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, suppose he does?
L635525	u8715	m591	NED	Maybe.
L635524	u8717	m591	THE KID	He's gonna die, ain't he?
L635510	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
L635509	u8715	m591	NED	We done that stuff.
L635508	u8717	m591	THE KID	All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
L635507	u8715	m591	NED	Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
L635500	u8717	m591	THE KID	We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
L635499	u8715	m591	NED	I don't kill nobody without him. 
L635498	u8717	m591	THE KID	Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
L635497	u8715	m591	NED	We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
L635491	u8717	m591	THE KID	That was your idea, I wanted to...
L635490	u8715	m591	NED	Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
L635489	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
L635488	u8715	m591	NED	He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
L635487	u8717	m591	THE KID	He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
L635485	u8717	m591	THE KID	He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
L635484	u8715	m591	NED	Move the candle closer, I can't see.
L635483	u8717	m591	THE KID	His pistol must of jammed.
L635482	u8715	m591	NED	Plenty of times.
L635481	u8717	m591	THE KID	Jesus.  You done this before?
L635358	u8717	m591	THE KID	Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
L635357	u8715	m591	NED	How many you killed, Kid?
L635356	u8717	m591	THE KID	Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
L635355	u8715	m591	NED	I don't like the question.
L635354	u8717	m591	THE KID	How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
L635353	u8715	m591	NED	Yeah.
L635352	u8717	m591	THE KID	Say, Ned... ?
L635315	u8717	m591	THE KID	I ain't blind, you asshole.
L635314	u8715	m591	NED	He's blind, for Chri...
L635313	u8717	m591	THE KID	Fuck you.
L635312	u8715	m591	NED	See that scrub oak yonder?
L635311	u8717	m591	THE KID	More.
L635310	u8715	m591	NED	We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
L635309	u8717	m591	THE KID	Far enough.
L635302	u8715	m591	NED	I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
L635301	u8717	m591	THE KID	Yeah?
L635300	u8715	m591	NED	You was right to change your mind, Kid.
L635299	u8717	m591	THE KID	Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
L635298	u8715	m591	NED	Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
L635286	u8717	m591	THE KID	You gonna share your half with him?
L635285	u8715	m591	NED	Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
L635284	u8717	m591	THE KID	Nothin's bent.
L635283	u8715	m591	NED	I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
L635277	u8717	m591	THE KID	I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
L635276	u8715	m591	NED	Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
L635273	u8717	m591	THE KID	Thought you was followin' me.
L635272	u8715	m591	NED	What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
L657170	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'm sure we will.
L657169	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
L657163	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
L657162	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What is this?  A whole new train?
L657161	u8923	m607	JIM	Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
L657151	u8923	m607	JIM	In the next two minutes?
L657150	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
L657149	u8923	m607	JIM	He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
L657148	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
L657121	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, I see, an easy plan!
L657120	u8923	m607	JIM	Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
L657115	u8923	m607	JIM	Where have you been?
L657114	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My God!  He's so excessive!
L657078	u8923	m607	JIM	That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
L657077	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	God in heaven, what is that?!
L657070	u8923	m607	JIM	Thank you.
L657069	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My hat is off to you, sir.
L657066	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Of course not.
L657065	u8923	m607	JIM	Are those just button buttons or...?
L657064	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
L657063	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It was in your book.
L657058	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
L657057	u8923	m607	JIM	There's only seventy-eight.
L657056	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
L657055	u8923	m607	JIM	We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
L657054	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
L657053	u8923	m607	JIM	I know!  I know!
L657052	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What?  President Grant is...!
L657051	u8923	m607	JIM	Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
L657002	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My pleasure.
L657001	u8923	m607	JIM	Oh, thank you.
L657000	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
L656996	u8923	m607	JIM	Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
L656995	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
L656983	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
L656982	u8923	m607	JIM	When we find him, he is mine.
L656980	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
L656979	u8923	m607	JIM	So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
L656978	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I adjusted it.
L656977	u8923	m607	JIM	Not again.
L656976	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
L656975	u8923	m607	JIM	And people are actually fooled by that?
L656974	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
L656973	u8923	m607	JIM	What is that?
L656971	u8923	m607	JIM	We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
L656970	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Relax.  We're almost there.
L656969	u8923	m607	JIM	Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
L656968	u8923	m607	JIM	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
L656967	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	"Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was ""damnably hot."""
L656966	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It's a town!
L656965	u8923	m607	JIM	It's not a guy...
L656964	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Willard...
L656955	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
L656954	u8923	m607	JIM	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
L656953	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What's this?
L656952	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
L656951	u8923	m607	JIM	No record of him.
L656950	u8923	m607	JIM	He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
L656949	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It is?
L656948	u8923	m607	JIM	It's better than nothing.
L656947	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Oh, damn!  That's it.
L656945	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
L656944	u8923	m607	JIM	This is good.
L656938	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
L656937	u8923	m607	JIM	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
L656936	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Know what this is?
L656898	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
L656897	u8923	m607	JIM	Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
L656896	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Thank you.
L656895	u8923	m607	JIM	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
L656894	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Can you fill me in here?
L656884	u8923	m607	JIM	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
L656883	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	They're so precious when they're asleep.
L656881	u8923	m607	JIM	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
L656880	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
L656879	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
L656878	u8923	m607	JIM	You might have mentioned you had that.
L656874	u8923	m607	JIM	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
L656873	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Uh... how long ago was this?
L656872	u8923	m607	JIM	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
L656871	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	So... what happened?
L656870	u8923	m607	JIM	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
L656869	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well... that, too.
L656868	u8923	m607	JIM	"Spontaneous.  I like that.  Most people say something like ""hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."""
L656867	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
L656866	u8923	m607	JIM	What way is that?
L656865	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
L656864	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
L656863	u8923	m607	JIM	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
L656862	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Jim, are you all right?
L656858	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	That's right... That's good.
L656857	u8923	m607	JIM	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
L656856	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Damn it, this is ridiculous.
L656855	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Hey, I tried the board.
L656854	u8923	m607	JIM	At least I tried something.
L656850	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	It's a repeating steam cannon!
L656849	u8923	m607	JIM	Never seen a gun fire so fast!
L656848	u8923	m607	JIM	I'm going to hit you.
L656847	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
L656845	u8923	m607	JIM	And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
L656844	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
L656835	u8923	m607	JIM	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
L656834	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	All that jumping and kicking.
L656833	u8923	m607	JIM	All what?
L656832	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	What was all that back there?
L656811	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
L656810	u8923	m607	JIM	"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""
L656809	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Now, what was that?
L656808	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
L656807	u8923	m607	JIM	You feeling all right?
L656806	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  Now, observe....
L656805	u8923	m607	JIM	Almost?
L656804	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
L656800	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
L656799	u8923	m607	JIM	All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
L656798	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
L656797	u8923	m607	JIM	Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
L656720	u8923	m607	JIM	Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
L656719	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
L656718	u8923	m607	JIM	That's a lot of butler.
L656716	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
L656715	u8923	m607	JIM	Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
L656714	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
L656712	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	My disguise.  And here...
L656711	u8923	m607	JIM	Prepare what?
L656710	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
L656709	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
L656708	u8923	m607	JIM	Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
L656707	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Limestone quarry?
L656697	u8923	m607	JIM	What about the explosive?
L656696	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
L656695	u8923	m607	JIM	Starting with a screw?
L656694	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
L656693	u8923	m607	JIM	Is this leading somewhere?
L656692	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
L656691	u8923	m607	JIM	Aha?
L656690	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Aha!
L656667	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	I'll work on it.
L656666	u8923	m607	JIM	That should put us ahead of the criminals.
L656663	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
L656662	u8923	m607	JIM	Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
L656661	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Try what?
L656660	u8923	m607	JIM	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
L656659	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
L656658	u8923	m607	JIM	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
L656657	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Always hoping.  Or this...
L656656	u8923	m607	JIM	You need that real often?
L656655	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
L656653	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Gadget guy?  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
L656652	u8923	m607	JIM	Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
L656651	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
L656650	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Ay, there's the rub.  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
L656649	u8923	m607	JIM	Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
L656648	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
L656647	u8923	m607	JIM	Put them all together and what do we have?
L656646	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
L656645	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Wouldn't dream of it.
L656644	u8923	m607	JIM	But don't pull that again.
L656632	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
L656631	u8923	m607	JIM	You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
L656630	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
L656629	u8923	m607	JIM	Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
L656628	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
L656627	u8923	m607	JIM	Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
L656626	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
L656625	u8923	m607	JIM	Funny.  So am I.
L656624	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
L656623	u8923	m607	JIM	I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
L656622	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
L656621	u8923	m607	JIM	Jim West.
L656620	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	J. S. Bach.
L657107	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
L657106	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
L657088	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
L657087	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He's not giving up?
L657080	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	But it only has six legs.
L657079	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He calls it the Tarantula.
L657060	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
L657059	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You didn't tell us you had this on!
L656824	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
L656823	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Yes, me!
L656822	u8919	m607	ARTEMUS	Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
L657095	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
L657094	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
L657093	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	I could get used to this, looking down on people.
L656762	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
L656761	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
L656760	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Anyone?
L656749	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	We'll see.
L656748	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	A new friend?
L657128	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Fine, I'll stop.
L657127	u8923	m607	JIM	You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
L656910	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
L656909	u8923	m607	JIM	You bring the best out in a man.
L656908	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	My.  It's gotten longer.
L656905	u8923	m607	JIM	Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
L656904	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	She's perfectly safe.
L656789	u8923	m607	JIM	I've had some practice.
L656788	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You've... done... this... before.
L656787	u8923	m607	JIM	Oh, I would hope not.
L656786	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Would that include me?
L656785	u8923	m607	JIM	Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
L656782	u8923	m607	JIM	I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
L656781	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
L656780	u8923	m607	JIM	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
L656779	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
L656778	u8923	m607	JIM	You tell me.
L656777	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
L656774	u8923	m607	JIM	I don't like to lose, either.
L656773	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
L656743	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	You most certainly do.
L656742	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
L656741	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
L656740	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
L656739	u8923	m607	JIM	Your guests, ma'am?
L656738	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
L656735	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	My... the wild west.
L656734	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
L656733	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	Really?
L656732	u8923	m607	JIM	Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
L656731	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
L656730	u8923	m607	JIM	You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
L656729	u8920	m607	CASSANDRA	I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
L656728	u8923	m607	JIM	My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
L657105	u8923	m607	JIM	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
L657104	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
L656618	u8923	m607	JIM	My friend?
L656617	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
L656616	u8921	m607	DOYLE	That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
L656615	u8923	m607	JIM	Private train?
L656614	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Your private train, sir.
L656613	u8921	m607	DOYLE	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
L656612	u8923	m607	JIM	Look, I'm Captain James West...
L656594	u8922	m607	GRANT	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
L656593	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
L656584	u8922	m607	GRANT	French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
L656583	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Yes sir.
L656582	u8922	m607	GRANT	French?
L656581	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
L656580	u8922	m607	GRANT	Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
L656579	u8926	m607	RICHARDS	Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
L656578	u8922	m607	GRANT	Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
L656963	u8922	m607	GRANT	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
L656962	u8923	m607	JIM	Where'd he say he was going to do this?
L656958	u8922	m607	GRANT	On my way to Denver...
L656957	u8923	m607	JIM	... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
L656607	u8922	m607	GRANT	And now the job's yours.
L656606	u8923	m607	JIM	And?
L656605	u8922	m607	GRANT	Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
L656604	u8922	m607	GRANT	Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
L656603	u8923	m607	JIM	Nicely said, sir.
L656602	u8922	m607	GRANT	We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
L656601	u8922	m607	GRANT	Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
L656600	u8923	m607	JIM	But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
L656592	u8923	m607	JIM	Nice to finally meet you, sir.
L656591	u8922	m607	GRANT	This is Colonel Richards.
L656590	u8923	m607	JIM	Good work.  Really.
L656589	u8922	m607	GRANT	That'll be all, boys.
L656588	u8923	m607	JIM	Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
L657140	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
L657139	u8923	m607	JIM	Easy now.
L657027	u8923	m607	JIM	So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
L657026	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
L657025	u8923	m607	JIM	Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
L657024	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	The first.
L657023	u8923	m607	JIM	Emperor Miguelito...?
L657022	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	I've even printed my own currency.
L657019	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
L657018	u8923	m607	JIM	That would be... the Mexican War?
L657017	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
L657016	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
L657015	u8923	m607	JIM	The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
L657013	u8923	m607	JIM	Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
L657012	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
L657011	u8923	m607	JIM	You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
L657010	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Philistine.
L657009	u8923	m607	JIM	He had a pressing engagement.
L657008	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
L657006	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
L657005	u8923	m607	JIM	You're not that big.
L656940	u8923	m607	JIM	Dr. Loveless?
L656939	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
L656927	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
L656926	u8923	m607	JIM	Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
L656769	u8923	m607	JIM	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
L656768	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
L656766	u8923	m607	JIM	I deal with some tough customers.
L656765	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
L656764	u8923	m607	JIM	No, sir... just a businessman.
L656763	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
L656757	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
L656756	u8923	m607	JIM	I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
L656754	u8924	m607	MIGUELITO	When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
L656753	u8923	m607	JIM	I admire a man with a sense of humor.
L657076	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
L657075	u8923	m607	JIM	I beg your pardon?
L657042	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	It is?
L657041	u8923	m607	JIM	Now it's a bomb.
L657040	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	It's a smelting retort.
L657039	u8923	m607	JIM	This is something.
L657038	u8923	m607	JIM	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
L657037	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
L657034	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
L657033	u8923	m607	JIM	Are you all right?
L656843	u8923	m607	JIM	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
L656842	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
L656841	u8923	m607	JIM	Who was this partner of his?
L656840	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	"I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the ""rare and unparalleled opportunity"" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do."
L656831	u8923	m607	JIM	We'll explain on the way.
L656830	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
L656829	u8923	m607	JIM	Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
L656819	u8925	m607	PEMBERTON	Yes!
L656818	u8923	m607	JIM	Dr. Pemberton?
L656549	u8923	m607	JIM	Right.
L656548	u8927	m607	WALTERS	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
L656547	u8923	m607	JIM	You're not going to use it, are you?
L656546	u8927	m607	WALTERS	Hey...!
L656545	u8923	m607	JIM	In an hour they're gone!
L656544	u8927	m607	WALTERS	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
L656543	u8923	m607	JIM	When are they coming?
L656542	u8927	m607	WALTERS	They're coming.
L656541	u8923	m607	JIM	Well?
