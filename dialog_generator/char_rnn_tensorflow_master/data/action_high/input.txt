CORNELIUS	Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
LEELOO	Corn-i-Lius?
CORNELIUS	At your service.

CORNELIUS	What're you laughing about?
LEELOO	Napoleon... small.

CORNELIUS	The case..with the stones... Where is it?
LEELOO	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
CORNELIUS	The case was stolen?

LEELOO	Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
CORNELIUS	You know exactly where they are!

LEELOO	Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
CORNELIUS	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.

LEELOO	Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
CORNELIUS	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

CORNELIUS	...We're saved!
ZORG	I'm fucked!

ZORG	Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
CORNELIUS	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
ZORG	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
CORNELIUS	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
ZORG	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
CORNELIUS	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
ZORG	Why?  What's wrong with me?
CORNELIUS	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
ZORG	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...

ZORG	...would you like a drink?
CORNELIUS	No thank you.
ZORG	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.

ZORG	...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
CORNELIUS	They are robots!

ZORG	Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
CORNELIUS	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
ZORG	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.

CORNELIUS	You are a monster, Zorg!
ZORG	I know...

KORBEN	Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
CORNELIUS	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.

KORBEN	She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
CORNELIUS	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
KORBEN	She dropped in on me... holding this.

CORNELIUS	Who are you?
KORBEN	I brought the girl remember?
CORNELIUS	The girl?

CORNELIUS	He's a she!
KORBEN	You noticed...
CORNELIUS	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
KORBEN	So you do know her.
CORNELIUS	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

KORBEN	They all like this in your family, father?
CORNELIUS	She's an exception..
CORNELIUS	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
KORBEN	Dallas. Korben Dallas.

CORNELIUS	Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
KORBEN	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
CORNELIUS	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
KORBEN	I know. I was there when she arrived.

KORBEN	Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
CORNELIUS	It means, "Never without my permission".
KORBEN	That's what I thought.

CORNELIUS	I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
KORBEN	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
CORNELIUS	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
KORBEN	What kind of mission?
CORNELIUS	We have to save the world.
KORBEN	Good luck..
CORNELIUS	Of course.
KORBEN	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.

CORNELIUS	What are you doing?
KORBEN	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

CORNELIUS	You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
KORBEN	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
CORNELIUS	Leeloo's in trouble?
KORBEN	When is she not in trouble?
CORNELIUS	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

KORBEN	Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
CORNELIUS	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

KORBEN	There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
CORNELIUS	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
KORBEN	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
CORNELIUS	That's what I'm saying.

CORNELIUS	Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
PRESIDENT	One more reason to shoot first eh?

PRESIDENT	Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
CORNELIUS	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
PRESIDENT	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.

CORNELIUS	We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
PRESIDENT	And then?
CORNELIUS	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.

PRESIDENT	Is there anything that can stop it?
CORNELIUS	Yes..thank God..

PRESIDENT	But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
CORNELIUS	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.

PRESIDENT	Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
CORNELIUS	Thank you, Mr. President.

CORNELIUS	What are we going to do?
PRESIDENT	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.

CORNELIUS	It's a miracle!!!
DAVID	What is?
CORNELIUS	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!

DAVID	Father, will you please explain what's going on?
CORNELIUS	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

DAVID	Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
CORNELIUS	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!

DAVID	What's she doing?
CORNELIUS	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.

DAVID	Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
CORNELIUS	Yes. Of course..

CORNELIUS	There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
DAVID	I didn't know your size.

DAVID	They really made her...
CORNELIUS	Perfect.

DAVID	I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
CORNELIUS	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.

CORNELIUS	Where's Leeloo?
DAVID	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
CORNELIUS	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!

DAVID	You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
CORNELIUS	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!

DIVA	You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
KORBEN	Who?
DIVA	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...

KORBEN	Leeloo... is... she's...
DIVA	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
KORBEN	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

DIVA	She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
KORBEN	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
DIVA	Do you love her?
KORBEN	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
DIVA	I don't have time... I need to know.
KORBEN	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
DIVA	I would like to have died in peace...

KORBEN	I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
DIVA	They are... with me...

KORBEN	Yeah?
FINGER	Hey bud! Finger here.

FINGER	I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
KORBEN	I was talking to the cat.
FINGER	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.

KORBEN	At least, the cat comes back.
FINGER	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
KORBEN	I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
FINGER	Don't exist bud.

KORBEN	I just found a picture of you.
FINGER	How do I look?
KORBEN	Like shit.

KORBEN	I don't need one.
FINGER	You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
KORBEN	Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
FINGER	How many points you got left on your license?
KORBEN	Uh... at least fifty.
FINGER	In your dreams! See you tonight!

KORBEN	Hello?
FINGER	Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
KORBEN	Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
FINGER	So, just how big was this fare?
KORBEN	5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..

FINGER	Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
KORBEN	Leeloo..

GIRL	Akina delutan, nou-shan.
KORBEN	...'Scuse me?

GIRL	Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
KORBEN	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.

GIRL	...Priest...
KORBEN	You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

GIRL	Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
KORBEN	Vito Cornelius?

GIRL	Eto Akta Gamat!
KORBEN	I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

KORBEN	...What's your name?
GIRL	Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
KORBEN	Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
GIRL	...Leeloo.

PRIEST	The Fifth Element...
KOMMANDER	Take them and put them in a safe place.

PRIEST	Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
KOMMANDER	When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
PRIEST	Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
KOMMANDER	Time is of no importance, only life is important.

KOMMANDER	When EVIL returns so shall we.
PRIEST	We will be ready, Lord.

KORBEN	...Hello?
MOTHER	You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
KORBEN	Hi Ma...
MOTHER	I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

MOTHER	Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
KORBEN	Yes ma..

KORBEN	Other than that... You all right?
MOTHER	...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

KORBEN	I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
MOTHER	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
KORBEN	All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

MOTHER	You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
KORBEN	Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
MOTHER	They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

KORBEN	Yeah?
MOTHER	Have you pulled yourself together?
KORBEN	...Not yet.

KORBEN	Hello?
MOTHER	You little sleaze bag!
KORBEN	...Ma???
MOTHER	Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

VOICE	Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
KORBEN	How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.

VOICE	Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
KORBEN	I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
VOICE	You have nine points left on your license..
KORBEN	Thanks for reminding me..

KORBEN	I'm sorry..
VOICE	This is a police control action..

VOICE	30 seconds...
KORBEN	Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?

VOICE	6... 5...
KORBEN	Found it?

KORBEN	...Hi.
LOC RHOD	Does it get any better or what!

LOC RHOD	...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
KORBEN	Uh... not really.

KORBEN	I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
LOC RHOD	Crystal.

LOC RHOD	My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
KORBEN	I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
LOC RHOD	Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
KORBEN	I don't think this is a good time...
LOC RHOD	...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
KORBEN	Yeah, very big, a giant.
LOC RHOD	I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...

KORBEN	You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
LOC RHOD	Got it...

KORBEN	Six to the left. One to the right.
LOC RHOD	He's on vacation.
KORBEN	We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.

LOC RHOD	Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
KORBEN	Not without Leeloo.

LOC RHOD	Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
KORBEN	I'll be right back.

LOC RHOD	You know how to fly this thing?
KORBEN	It's like a cab isn't it?

LOC RHOD	I don't even know what I'm looking for!
KORBEN	Fuck it! Hold tight!

KORBEN	Solid little jobs, aren't they?
LOC RHOD	Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

KORBEN	What did you say? What did you do?
LOC RHOD	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
KORBEN	Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!

KORBEN	Is that all?
LOC RHOD	Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

MUNRO	Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
KORBEN	What mission?
MUNRO	To save the world.
KORBEN	Where have I heard this song before?
MUNRO	You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
KORBEN	Just one... why me?
MUNRO	Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.

MUNRO	Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
KORBEN	And the third one?
MUNRO	You're the only one left alive...

MUNRO	Don't you open your messages?
KORBEN	I've had enough good news for today
MUNRO	You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.

KORBEN	You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
MUNRO	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
KORBEN	I'm not going.
MUNRO	Why not?
KORBEN	One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.

KORBEN	...Shit!
MUNRO	What is it?

KORBEN	It's my wife.
MUNRO	I thought you were divorced.
KORBEN	I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...

KORBEN	...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
MUNRO	Three of us will never fit in there!
KORBEN	Oh, yes you will...

LEELOO	Apipoulai!
KORBEN	I suppose that means "Hi" ?

LEELOO	Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
KORBEN	Uh..you're welcome.

KORBEN	You hear that?
LEELOO	Cornelius..
KORBEN	Oh god!

LEELOO	Dinoine chagantakat!
KORBEN	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.

LEELOO	Apipoulai!
KORBEN	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...

LEELOO	Love...
KORBEN	Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!

KORBEN	Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
LEELOO	What is... Make Love?

KORBEN	Finished what?
LEELOO	Learning language.
KORBEN	Which one?
LEELOO	All 900.

KORBEN	You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
LEELOO	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
KORBEN	I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
LEELOO	Apipoussan!
KORBEN	Apipoussan?
LEELOO	Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
KORBEN	Uh...
LEELOO	...Hoppi-hoppa.

KORBEN	Here we go again...
LEELOO	You know women normally change five times more than men.
KORBEN	You get that off the screen?
LEELOO	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
KORBEN	You noticed..
LEELOO	OK, you can turn around!

KORBEN	Where you going?
LEELOO	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
KORBEN	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!

KORBEN	I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
LEELOO	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
KORBEN	It's difficult.

LEELOO	You're nothing but a... a...
KORBEN	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.

LEELOO	I'm so very sad.
KORBEN	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
LEELOO	Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
KORBEN	I told you not to read all that crap!
LEELOO	Protect life... Until death.

KORBEN	Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
LEELOO	The wind blows... the fire burns...
KORBEN	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
LEELOO	...The rain falls...

KORBEN	It's up to you now, Angel!
LEELOO	I'm so tired...
KORBEN	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
LEELOO	I want to sleep... forever...
KORBEN	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!

LEELOO	What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
KORBEN	You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
LEELOO	...Like love...
KORBEN	Exactly.
LEELOO	But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.

LEELOO	I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
KORBEN	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
LEELOO	Why?... Why would you need me?
KORBEN	Because...

LEELOO	Tell me...
KORBEN	I love you...

THAI	Not going to open?
KORBEN	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
THAI	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
KORBEN	The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
THAI	You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

KORBEN	At least I won lunch.
THAI	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..

MUGGER	The cash man!
KORBEN	Been here long?
MUGGER	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!

KORBEN	Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
MUGGER	Uh..
KORBEN	You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

MUGGER	It's not?
KORBEN	You gotta push the little yellow button...

MUGGER	Thanks..
KORBEN	You're welcome..

MUNRO	This is all that survived?
MACTILBURGH	Actually only one cell survived..
MUNRO	Have you identified it?
MACTILBURGH	It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
MUNRO	Talk English Doc.
MACTILBURGH	This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
MUNRO	Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
MACTILBURGH	Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

MACTILBURGH	The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
MUNRO	Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
MACTILBURGH	We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

MACTILBURGH	...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
MUNRO	Wonderful!

MUNRO	This thing solid?
MACTILBURGH	An elephant couldn't crack it.

MUNRO	Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
MACTILBURGH	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

MUNRO	I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
PRESIDENT	And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
MUNRO	The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
PRESIDENT	...What do you mean?

PRESIDENT	I want your best man on this!
MUNRO	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

MUNRO	They just landed in the desert.
PRESIDENT	How much time is left?

PRESIDENT	Staedert, do you read me?
STAEDERT	I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .

PRESIDENT	Is that better?
STAEDERT	Perfect, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT	I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
STAEDERT	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
PRESIDENT	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.

STAEDERT	Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
PRESIDENT	Options.
STAEDERT	Wait or act.
PRESIDENT	Recommendations.
STAEDERT	My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
PRESIDENT	Gentlemen?

PRESIDENT	Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
STAEDERT	I'm about to, Mr. President.

PRIEST	Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
PROFESSOR	..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..
PRIEST	Amen..

PROFESSOR	Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
PRIEST	Only too well... here you must be parched..

PROFESSOR	A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
PRIEST	Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

PRIEST	Drink!
PROFESSOR	To fame.. salud..

ZORG	How's that? Can you hear me better now?
SECRETARY	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
ZORG	Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
SECRETARY	Yes, Sir!
ZORG	Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
SECRETARY	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
ZORG	I'm not at the hotel!

SHADOW	Am I disturbing you?
ZORG	No... not at all.  Where are you?

SHADOW	...Not far, now.
ZORG	Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!

SHADOW	Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
ZORG	Got it.
SHADOW	How's our deal coming along?
ZORG	Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

ZORG	The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
SHADOW	...I can't wait to be among you.

HUDSON	This floor's freezing.
APONE	Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
HUDSON	Would you, Sir?

HUDSON	Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
APONE	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

HUDSON	Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
APONE	Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.

HUDSON	Movement!
APONE	Position?
HUDSON	Can't lock up...
APONE	Talk to me, Hudson.
HUDSON	Uh, seems to be in front and behind.

GORMAN	...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
APONE	Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.

GORMAN	Okay, let's do it.
APONE	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.

GORMAN	Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
APONE	Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

GORMAN	First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
APONE	Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

GORMAN	Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
APONE	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

GORMAN	Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
APONE	Say again?  All after incinerators?

BISHOP	I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
RIPLEY	Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...

RIPLEY	Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
BISHOP	Yes.  That follows.
RIPLEY	But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
BISHOP	That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
RIPLEY	You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
BISHOP	Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
RIPLEY	Could it be intelligent?
BISHOP	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.

BISHOP	That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
RIPLEY	How long until it blows?
BISHOP	I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.

RIPLEY	And it's too late to shut it down?
BISHOP	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.

BISHOP	I'll go.
RIPLEY	What?
BISHOP	I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
RIPLEY	All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?

RIPLEY	It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
BISHOP	See you soon.

RIPLEY	HOW MUCH TIME?
BISHOP	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
RIPLEY	WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

BISHOP	Ripley...
RIPLEY	She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
BISHOP	In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.

RIPLEY	You did okay, Bishop.
BISHOP	Well, thanks, I --

RIPLEY	Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
BURKE	You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?

RIPLEY	Have they located my daughter yet?
BURKE	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

RIPLEY	Is she...?
BURKE	Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.

RIPLEY	Amy.
BURKE	Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.

RIPLEY	You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
BURKE	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
RIPLEY	I get the picture.
BURKE	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.

BURKE	You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
RIPLEY	They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
BURKE	You are a head case.  Have a donut.

RIPLEY	No.  There's no way!
BURKE	Hear me out...
RIPLEY	I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.

RIPLEY	What about you?  What's your interest in this?
BURKE	Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'

RIPLEY	Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
BURKE	I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
RIPLEY	That's right.
BURKE	Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
RIPLEY	It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
BURKE	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
RIPLEY	If I go.
BURKE	If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
RIPLEY	Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.

BURKE	Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
RIPLEY	No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.

BURKE	Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
RIPLEY	Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
BURKE	That's the plan.  My word on it.

RIPLEY	You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
BURKE	Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

RIPLEY	I hope you're right.  I really do.
BURKE	I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.

RIPLEY	That the atmosphere processor?
BURKE	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.

RIPLEY	They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
BURKE	Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
RIPLEY	That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
BURKE	She's right.

RIPLEY	No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
BURKE	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
RIPLEY	Why not?

BURKE	Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
RIPLEY	They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
BURKE	This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
RIPLEY	Bullshit!

RIPLEY	You son of a bitch.
BURKE	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
RIPLEY	What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
BURKE	Corporal Hicks!?
RIPLEY	This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?

BURKE	Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
RIPLEY	You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
BURKE	You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
RIPLEY	But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
BURKE	Now, wait a second --
RIPLEY	You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

RIPLEY	You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
BURKE	Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.

BURKE	I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
RIPLEY	Sorry to disappoint you.

BURKE	Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
GORMAN	You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
BURKE	These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
GORMAN	We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.

BURKE	Still nothing from the colony?
GORMAN	Dead on all channels.

GORMAN	Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
BURKE	It's insured.

BURKE	What's he scanning for?
GORMAN	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

BURKE	We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
GORMAN	Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.

RIPLEY	How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
GORMAN	Thirty-eight...simulated.

GORMAN	Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
RIPLEY	The structure seems intact.  They have power.

RIPLEY	One of us?
GORMAN	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?

GORMAN	Where are your parents?  You have to try...
RIPLEY	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.

GORMAN	What is it?
RIPLEY	I don't know.
GORMAN	Proceed inside.

GORMAN	So.
RIPLEY	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
GORMAN	So?  So?

RIPLEY	GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
GORMAN	Shut up.  Just shut up!

GORMAN	I told them to fall back...
RIPLEY	They're but off!  Do something!

RIPLEY	How do you feel?
GORMAN	All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
RIPLEY	Forget it.

GORMAN	At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
HUDSON	Sir?
GORMAN	Yes, Hicks?
HUDSON	Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
GORMAN	What's the question?
HUDSON	Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
GORMAN	All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.

GORMAN	Are there any questions?  Hudson?
HUDSON	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?

GORMAN	All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
GORMAN	...We're coming in.
HUDSON	He's coming in.  I feel safer already.

HUDSON	Sir, the CPU is on-line.
GORMAN	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.

HUDSON	Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
GORMAN	Alive?
HUDSON	Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.

GORMAN	We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
HUDSON	You tell me.  I only work here.

HICKS	Save it.
HUDSON	Sure, Hicks.

HUDSON	Let's get the fuck out of here!
HICKS	Not that tunnel, the other one!

HUDSON	Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
HICKS	Are you finished?  You okay?

HICKS	Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
HUDSON	Aye-firmative.

HICKS	We got problems.
HUDSON	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?

HUDSON	Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
HICKS	I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.

HICKS	The corner!  Ready?
HUDSON	Do it!

HUDSON	Seventeen meters.
HICKS	Let's get these things lit.

HICKS	Well you're not reading it right!
HUDSON	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

HUDSON	Let's go!  Let's go!
HICKS	Fuckin' A!

RIPLEY	Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
HICKS	Poor bastard.

RIPLEY	How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
HICKS	About seventeen days.

RIPLEY	All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
HICKS	We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
RIPLEY	That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.

HICKS	They're in the approach corridor.
RIPLEY	On my way.

RIPLEY	Now many?
HICKS	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

HICKS	Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
RIPLEY	But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

RIPLEY	They'll get us.
HICKS	Maybe.  Maybe not.
RIPLEY	Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
HICKS	If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.

RIPLEY	What's this?
HICKS	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
RIPLEY	Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
HICKS	Yeah.  I've noticed.

HICKS	Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
RIPLEY	The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.

RIPLEY	You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
HICKS	Let's waste him.  No offense.

HICKS	It's game time.
RIPLEY	Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.

RIPLEY	They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
HICKS	We didn't miss anything.

RIPLEY	Locked.
HICKS	Stand back.

RIPLEY	No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
HICKS	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!

RIPLEY	Hicks, don't let him leave.
HICKS	We ain't going anywhere.

RIPLEY	Ellen.
HICKS	Don't be long, Ellen.

HUDSON	Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
VASQUEZ	No.  Have you?

HUDSON	Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
VASQUEZ	Fuck you.
HUDSON	Anytime.  Anywhere.

VASQUEZ	All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
HUDSON	Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?

VASQUEZ	Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
HUDSON	Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!

HUDSON	Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
VASQUEZ	Hudson, give us a break.

HUDSON	It's inside the complex.
VASQUEZ	You're just reading me.
HUDSON	No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.

HUDSON	Sounds like you, Hicks.
RIPLEY	The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --

RIPLEY	Looks like it stung him.
HUDSON	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.

RIPLEY	You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
HUDSON	Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.

HUDSON	Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
RIPLEY	She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.

RIPLEY	This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
HUDSON	Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.

RIPLEY	Thanks.
HUDSON	Uh, what's next?

RIPLEY	We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
HUDSON	How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
RIPLEY	I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
HUDSON	Think of what?  We're fucked.
RIPLEY	What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?

RIPLEY	Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
HUDSON	Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.

RIPLEY	They cut the power.
HUDSON	What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.

HUDSON	This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
RIPLEY	Just get back here!

HUDSON	Range twenty meters.
RIPLEY	Seal the door.

HUDSON	Fifteen meters.
RIPLEY	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!

HUDSON	Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
RIPLEY	They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?

HUDSON	Nine meters.  Eight.
RIPLEY	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
HUDSON	It's readin' right.  Look!

LYDECKER	You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
SIMPSON	Yeah.  What?
LYDECKER	There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
SIMPSON	Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
LYDECKER	So what do I tell this guy?
SIMPSON	Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.

MED-TECH	And how are we today?
RIPLEY	Terrible.
MED-TECH	Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
RIPLEY	How long have I been on Gateway station?
MED-TECH	Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?

MED-TECH	Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
RIPLEY	No.. I've slept enough.

RIPLEY	What did you say?
NEWT	Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.

NEWT	Casey.  She's my only friend.
RIPLEY	What about me?

NEWT	I don't want you for a friend.
RIPLEY	Why not?
NEWT	Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.

RIPLEY	They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
NEWT	They're dead.
RIPLEY	Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
NEWT	You promise?
RIPLEY	Cross my heart.
NEWT	And hope to die?

NEWT	I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
RIPLEY	The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
NEWT	Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
RIPLEY	You're really something, ace.

NEWT	I guess we're not leaving, right?
RIPLEY	I'm sorry, Newt.
NEWT	You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.

RIPLEY	Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
NEWT	I don't want to...I have scary dreams.

NEWT	Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
RIPLEY	Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
NEWT	My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.

RIPLEY	Yes, there are, aren't there.
NEWT	Why do they tell little kids that?

RIPLEY	Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
NEWT	Did one of those things grow inside her?

RIPLEY	I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
NEWT	Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
RIPLEY	No, it's different, honey.
NEWT	Did you ever have a baby?
RIPLEY	Yes.  A little girl.
NEWT	Where is she?
RIPLEY	Gone.
NEWT	You mean dead.

NEWT	Don't go!  Please.
RIPLEY	I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

RIPLEY	Newt.  Newt, wake up.
NEWT	Wah...?  Where are...?
RIPLEY	Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.

NEWT	Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
RIPLEY	I know, honey.  Me too.

RIPLEY	Burke!  Open the door!
NEWT	Look!

NEWT	Come on.  Crawl faster.
RIPLEY	DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
NEWT	Sure.  Go left.

NEWT	This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
RIPLEY	Newt, wait!

NEWT	I knew you'd come.
RIPLEY	Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.

NEWT	Mommy...Mommy?
RIPLEY	Right here, baby.  Right here.

NEWT	Are we going to sleep now?
RIPLEY	That's right.
NEWT	Can we dream?
RIPLEY	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

RIPLEY	Look, I told you...
VAN LEUWEN	It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.

VAN LEUWEN	The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
RIPLEY	That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.

RIPLEY	Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
VAN LEUWEN	Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
RIPLEY	...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...

RIPLEY	Why won't you check out LV-426?
VAN LEUWEN	Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
RIPLEY	What are you talking about. What people?

RIPLEY	How many colonists?
VAN LEUWEN	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
RIPLEY	Sweet Jesus.

SMECKER	What did he bring him in for?
AUGUSTUS	Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
SMECKER	Just for him?
AUGUSTUS	Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
SMECKER	Up where?
AUGUSTUS	Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
SMECKER	Oh fuck! 

AUGUSTUS	Fuck you.
YAKAVETTA	Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
AUGUSTUS	I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?

YAKAVETTA	Hey, I just...
AUGUSTUS	Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
YAKAVETTA	I need Il Duce.
AUGUSTUS	The Duke?  What did you do?
YAKAVETTA	This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.

AUGUSTUS	Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
YAKAVETTA	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
AUGUSTUS	Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.

YAKAVETTA	There's ways around that.
AUGUSTUS	Go find one.

MOM	Lord's name.
BOTH	Mother Mary, full of grace.
MOM	What did you do, Connor?

MOM	Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
BOTH	Yes mother.
MOM	I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!

MOM	Are ya ready?
BOTH	Aye.

CHAFFEY	Yes sir.
SMECKER	Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.

SMECKER	Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
CHAFFEY	I can't find the second one, sir.
SMECKER	Look under the body.
CHAFFEY	Got it.

CHAFFEY	Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
SMECKER	Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.

SMECKER	Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
CHAFFEY	Any tips on where these guys may be?
SMECKER	Any word back from the E.R.s?

CHAFFEY	Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
SMECKER	What?
CHAFFEY	The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
SMECKER	You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?

ROCCO	Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
CONNOR	Where's your gun?
ROCCO	Chest pocket.  Shit!
CONNOR	This is a six-shooter.

ROCCO	Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
CONNOR	Let's do him right here.

ROCCO	What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
CONNOR	Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.

ROCCO	What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
CONNOR	Get a hold of yourself, man.

ROCCO	Anybody you think is evil?
CONNOR	Yes.
ROCCO	Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
CONNOR	Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.

CONNOR	Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
ROCCO	Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.

CONNOR	Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
ROCCO	Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
CONNOR	You sound real remorseful.

ROCCO	She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
CONNOR	Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
ROCCO	What?
CONNOR	Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
ROCCO	What are you saying?
CONNOR	Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
ROCCO	You think they sold me out? No way.
CONNOR	He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
ROCCO	No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
CONNOR	He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
ROCCO	No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
CONNOR	Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
ROCCO	No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.

ROCCO	Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
CONNOR	What happened?
ROCCO	I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!

ROCCO	What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
CONNOR	Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!

CONNOR	Anybody see ya?
ROCCO	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.

CONNOR	Yeah, well...
ROCCO	Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?

CONNOR	I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
ROCCO	MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!

CONNOR	What the fuck are you doing?
ROCCO	I-I'll tip her.

ROCCO	What? What is it?
CONNOR	This place is like a scumbag yard sale.

ROCCO	Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
CONNOR	No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
ROCCO	Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.

ROCCO	You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
CONNOR	Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
ROCCO	C'mon!

CONNOR	Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
ROCCO	Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!

CONNOR	Look again for fuck sake!
ROCCO	I know what the fuck he looks like!

CONNOR	Shit.
ROCCO	What?  What, that guy?

ROCCO	They got nothing.
CONNOR	This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

CONNOR	You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
ROCCO	Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
CONNOR	Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
ROCCO	You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.

ROCCO	You guys?
CONNOR	We're here brother.
ROCCO	You gotta keep going.

CONNOR	Hello.
MOM	Connor, is that you?

CONNOR	Mother, is that you?
MOM	Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
CONNOR	Ma, what's wrong?

MOM	It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
CONNOR	Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.

MOM	I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
CONNOR	What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?

CONNOR	What?! What are you doin'?
MOM	I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
CONNOR	Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.

CONNOR	No ma! No!
MOM	BLAME...

CONNOR	How's Uncle Sibeal?
MOM	Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.

CONNOR	Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
MOM	What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
CONNOR	Well, I didn't but...

CONNOR	Yeah, we promise.
MOM	Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.

MOM	Still bickerin' over that, huh?
CONNOR	Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
MOM	All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.

SMECKER	You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
CONNOR	We... met them last night.
SMECKER	They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?

SMECKER	So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
CONNOR	We paid attention in school.
SMECKER	Know any other languages?

SMECKER	Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
CONNOR	Our mother can see through bags.

CONNOR	Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
SMECKER	So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
CONNOR	I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
SMECKER	I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
CONNOR	We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
SMECKER	Be careful.
CONNOR	I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 

CONNOR	We're alive.
DOC	An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.

DOC	What are you going to do?
CONNOR	We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
DOC	y-y-yeah that's what he said.

CONNOR	Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
DOC	Right.

CONNOR	Would someone please come over here and...
DOC	Fuck!
CONNOR	me up the...
DOC	Ass!

CONNOR	I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
MURPHY	Aye.

CONNOR	Hey Murphy?
MURPHY	Aye.
CONNOR	How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
MURPHY	How many?
CONNOR	Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.

MURPHY	No fuckin' hot water man. That...
CONNOR	Shut it. It's Ma.

CONNOR	Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
MURPHY	Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.

CONNOR	Oh, Jesus.
MURPHY	I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
CONNOR	Don't even do it, ya bastard.
MURPHY	He got beat up by a girl.
CONNOR	If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.

MURPHY	All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
CONNOR	Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.

MURPHY	What do we tell him about the guns and money?
CONNOR	We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there.
MURPHY	Okay. We're ready.

CONNOR	A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
MURPHY	Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.

CONNOR	Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
MURPHY	Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?

CONNOR	Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?
MURPHY	I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan.

MURPHY	How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
CONNOR	Italian.

CONNOR	I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
MURPHY	German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
CONNOR	Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.

CONNOR	Absolutely not.
MURPHY	No pictures, either.

CONNOR	Destroy all that which is evil...
MURPHY	...so that which is good may flourish

CONNOR	Know what we need, man?... some rope.
MURPHY	For what?
CONNOR	Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
MURPHY	What?
CONNOR	Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
MURPHY	Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
CONNOR	I'm serious.
MURPHY	Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
CONNOR	I don't know they just always need it.
MURPHY	What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.

CONNOR	Is that right, Rambo?
MURPHY	All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.

MURPHY	Nervous?
CONNOR	A bit.
MURPHY	Me, too.

CONNOR	See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
MURPHY	Just like on TV.

MURPHY	Where the fuck are you going?
CONNOR	We'll find it. Just calm down.
MURPHY	No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.

CONNOR	We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
MURPHY	Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
CONNOR	Sh, sh! Fuck you!

MURPHY	That was way easier than I thought.
CONNOR	Aye.
MURPHY	On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
CONNOR	Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
MURPHY	Oh, we're good man.
CONNOR	Yes, we are.

MURPHY	Nine bodies.
CONNOR	Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?

MURPHY	Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
CONNOR	Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
MURPHY	Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.

MURPHY	Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
CONNOR	Yes.
MURPHY	Then what the fuck?

CONNOR	Who did you kill?
MURPHY	Holy shit. Who? How many?

MURPHY	So what do you think?
CONNOR	I'm strangely comfortable with it.

MURPHY	We've teamed up with a sex offender.
CONNOR	So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?

MURPHY	Give the guy a shot.
CONNOR	Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.

MURPHY	There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
CONNOR	A-fuckin'-men!

MURPHY	That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
CONNOR	And he is one smart man.

CONNOR	He isn't to be touched.
MURPHY	He's a good man.

CONNOR	Now, you will receive us.
MURPHY	We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
CONNOR	We do not want your tired and sick.
MURPHY	It is your corrupt we claim.
CONNOR	It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
MURPHY	With every breath we shall hunt them down.
CONNOR	Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
MURPHY	Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
CONNOR	These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
MURPHY	There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
CONNOR	For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
MURPHY	And we will send you to whatever God you wish.

ROZ	I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
CONNOR	Okay then... let's get ya started.

CONNOR	Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
ROZ	Rule of thumb?
CONNOR	Yeah?
ROZ	Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.

ROZ	I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
CONNOR	Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.

ROZ	Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
CONNOR	Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.

DOLLY	Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
SMECKER	Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.

SMECKER	And number three, Dolly.
DOLLY	Uh... two shooters!
SMECKER	Fan-fuckin-tastic!

DOLLY	So, what do we do now?
SMECKER	That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.

DOLLY	She was in here when it went down.
SMECKER	Can she I.D. them?
DOLLY	They were wearing masks.
SMECKER	Of course they were. How many?
DOLLY	Three.

DOLLY	Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
SMECKER	Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.

DOLLY	Maybe the three of them had something in common.
SMECKER	No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.

SMECKER	And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
DOLLY	That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.

SMECKER	The shooter knew these guys, huh?
DOLLY	How do you figure?
SMECKER	Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.

ROCCO	No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
DONNA	Rocco!

ROCCO	What?
DONNA	Where's my cat?
ROCCO	I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
DONNA	You... oh god, why?
ROCCO	I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
DONNA	You killed my... my...

ROCCO	Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
DONNA	My, my...
ROCCO	Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
DONNA	Pee...Per...Man.
ROCCO	Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
DONNA	It was... It was...
ROCCO	Male or female, bitch?!!

DUFFY	So what are you thinkin' here?
SMECKER	Really want to know?

SMECKER	So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
DUFFY	These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
SMECKER	The what man?
DUFFY	The fat man.
SMECKER	Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
DUFFY	He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
SMECKER	And the pennies?
DUFFY	New hitman wants to leave his mark
SMECKER	That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
DUFFY	Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
SMECKER	The Greeks. The Italians.
DUFFY	The Sicilians.

SMECKER	The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
DUFFY	They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
SMECKER	Excellent! Number two. Greenly.

SMECKER	Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
DUFFY	What about one guy with two guns?
SMECKER	Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.

SMECKER	Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
DUFFY	It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
SMECKER	And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.

SMECKER	Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
DUFFY	No way they could have seen it?
SMECKER	Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?

DUFFY	Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
SMECKER	What?
DUFFY	A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
SMECKER	Why was I not informed of this?

SMECKER	These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
DUFFY	Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
SMECKER	Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
DUFFY	Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
SMECKER	Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.

GREENLY	That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
SMECKER	Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
GREENLY	Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?

GREENLY	Who the...
SMECKER	Twist of lemon!
GREENLY	Chief, what the fuck is this?
SMECKER	Sweet-n-low!

SMECKER	He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
GREENLY	Why do you always disrespect me like that?
SMECKER	Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.

SMECKER	How many bodies, Greenly?
GREENLY	Eight.

SMECKER	While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
GREENLY	Shit! Shit!

GREENLY	Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
SMECKER	It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!

SMECKER	After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
GREENLY	Witness?
SMECKER	No way they could have seen it.

GREENLY	They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
SMECKER	Who were the victims?
GREENLY	A couple of peons for the mob and...
SMECKER	Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!

GREENLY	What if it was just one guy with six guns?
SMECKER	Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?

MURPHY	What the...?
MOM	I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.

MURPHY	Oh my god!
MOM	I...

MURPHY	Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
MOM	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.

MOM	It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
MURPHY	Just called ta torture us did ya?

MOM	But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
MURPHY	Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.

MOM	Promise me boys.
MURPHY	We promise.

MURPHY	Right now.
ROCCO	Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.

ROCCO	This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
MURPHY	Hallelujah, Jaffar.
ROCCO	So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?

ROCCO	Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
MURPHY	We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.

ROCCO	You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
MURPHY	Who says that? You could take credit on it.
ROCCO	What are you serious?
MURPHY	Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.

ROCCO	Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
MURPHY	Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
ROCCO	Fuck you!
MURPHY	Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
ROCCO	Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!

MURPHY	Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
ROCCO	I'll be back at 9:00.

MURPHY	Hello?
ROCCO	Hey Murph.
MURPHY	Roc. You okay?
ROCCO	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY	No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO	I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.

MURPHY	Hello?
ROCCO	Hey, Murph.
MURPHY	Roc. You okay?
ROCCO	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY	No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO	I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.

ROCCO	Hurry the fuck up!
MURPHY	This is some crazy shit, man!
ROCCO	Those cocksuckers sold me out!

ROCCO	Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
MURPHY	You sure you killed them?

MURPHY	Liberating isn't it?
ROCCO	Y'know it is, a bit.

ROCCO	Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
MURPHY	So?
ROCCO	So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?

MURPHY	Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
ROCCO	Well, what'ya do?

MURPHY	You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
ROCCO	Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...

ROCCO	Worst day of my life, man.
MURPHY	Well, I'm sold.

MURPHY	Well he sure as fuck knew you!
ROCCO	Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!

ROCCO	Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
MURPHY	What the fuck do you mean?
ROCCO	I mean he ain't here.

MURPHY	You bet your ass he will.
ROCCO	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.

ROCCO	Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
MURPHY	We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.

MURPHY	We'll keep going, Roc.
ROCCO	You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.

SMECKER	Hello? You there?
PRIEST	Y-Yes my son.

PRIEST	Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
SMECKER	Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
PRIEST	What is it my son?
SMECKER	It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
PRIEST	God's permission? God doesn't...

SMECKER	But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
PRIEST	You believe?
SMECKER	Yes.
PRIEST	You feel?
SMECKER	Yes.
PRIEST	You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.

SMECKER	Has he now?
PRIEST	You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
SMECKER	I guess not.
PRIEST	It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.

SMECKER	You're right.
PRIEST	Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
SMECKER	I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
PRIEST	Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
SMECKER	I believe these young men are right.
PRIEST	You know them personally?
SMECKER	Yes.
PRIEST	Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
SMECKER	No. They would never do that.

PRIEST	The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
SMECKER	Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
PRIEST	Forgive me father.
SMECKER	Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.

ROCCO	You gonna do what I say, got it?
PRIEST	Yes.
ROCCO	I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
PRIEST	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
ROCCO	Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

PRIEST	Don't do this my son.
ROCCO	Open it!
PRIEST	Have you no fear of God?
ROCCO	That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.

ROCCO	Father, I'll do you right here.
PRIEST	God have mercy on my soul.

ROCCO	Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
PRIEST	What do you want me to say?
ROCCO	Just be natural, goddamit.
PRIEST	How long since your last confession, my son?

ROCCO	I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
PRIEST	Just go!

ROCCO	Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
YAKAVETTA	Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

YAKAVETTA	Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
ROCCO	Yeah boss?

YAKAVETTA	I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
ROCCO	The... The funny man.
YAKAVETTA	The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
ROCCO	Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
YAKAVETTA	He's a nigger.
ROCCO	Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...

YAKAVETTA	Continue the joke.
ROCCO	He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."

VINCENZO	Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
ROCCO	Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
VINCENZO	Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!

VINCENZO	I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
ROCCO	Fuck you Vincenzo.
VINCENZO	Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
ROCCO	I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.

ABBOTT	You told me Bourne was dead.
GRETKOV	There was a mistake.
ABBOTT	I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
GRETKOV	Will it track back to us?
ABBOTT	No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
GRETKOV	And the Landy woman?
ABBOTT	She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
GRETKOV	Anything else?

ABBOTT	Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
GRETKOV	One last push. One.

GRETKOV	Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
ABBOTT	What do you mean?
GRETKOV	Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
ABBOTT	Save it for Bourne.
GRETKOV	What?

ABBOTT	He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
GRETKOV	Bourne comes here? Why?

PAMELA	Treadstone.
ABBOTT	Never heard of it.
PAMELA	That's not gonna fly.
ABBOTT	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.

ABBOTT	And what are we looking for?
PAMELA	I want to know about Treadstone.
ABBOTT	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
PAMELA	He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.

PAMELA	Let's talk about Conklin.
ABBOTT	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
PAMELA	I want to know what happened.
ABBOTT	What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
PAMELA	So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
ABBOTT	I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
PAMELA	And Bourne? Where's he now?
ABBOTT	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
PAMELA	I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.

PAMELA	...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
PAMELA	...this is Conklin's computer.
PAMELA	...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
ABBOTT	Do you know what his budget was?
PAMELA	Excuse me.
ABBOTT	We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
PAMELA	May I finish?
ABBOTT	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
PAMELA	What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
ABBOTT	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.

ABBOTT	Berlin!
PAMELA	I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
ABBOTT	You don't know what you're getting into here.
PAMELA	And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...

ABBOTT	Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
PAMELA	Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
ABBOTT	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
PAMELA	Don't you want answers?
ABBOTT	There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?

PAMELA	So what's he doing? You believe him?
ABBOTT	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
PAMELA	Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.

PAMELA	Sorry to wake you.
ABBOTT	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?

ABBOTT	What?
PAMELA	They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
ABBOTT	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
PAMELA	Did he say anything to you?
ABBOTT	No... It must have been Bourne.

ABBOTT	Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
PAMELA	Don't know.
ABBOTT	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
PAMELA	I'm sorry, Ward.

ABBOTT	Sit down.
PAMELA	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
ABBOTT	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
PAMELA	'Why' would be enough for me.
ABBOTT	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
PAMELA	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
ABBOTT	Why not? It was just money.
PAMELA	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
ABBOTT	Had to be done.
PAMELA	No good options left?
ABBOTT	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
PAMELA	No. You lost your way.
ABBOTT	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.

ZORN	Sir...
ABBOTT	Thanks.

ABBOTT	She say what time I should call?
ZORN	The sooner the better.

ZORN	I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
ABBOTT	What do you have, Danny?
ZORN	You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
ABBOTT	And?
ZORN	There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
ABBOTT	It was staged?
ZORN	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
ABBOTT	Jesus...
ZORN	Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
ABBOTT	Keep going...
ZORN	Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
ABBOTT	Lots of people...
ZORN	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.

ABBOTT	Who else knows about this?
ZORN	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
ABBOTT	Show me again...
ZORN	Okay... 

BOURNE	Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
IRENA	I speak English.

BOURNE	Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
IRENA	Okay.

BOURNE	It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
IRENA	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
BOURNE	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
IRENA	No, I do.

BOURNE	I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
IRENA	What?

BOURNE	It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
IRENA	Yes...
BOURNE	That's not what happened to your parents.
IRENA	Then what?
BOURNE	I killed them.

BOURNE	It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
IRENA	You killed them.

BOURNE	They loved you.  And I killed them.
IRENA	How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
BOURNE	I don't want you to forgive me.

BOURNE	It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
IRENA	You're a liar.
BOURNE	You know I'm not.
IRENA	YOU'RE A LIAR!
BOURNE	Look at me.

IRENA	I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
BOURNE	I can't let you do that either.
IRENA	Because you're afraid!
BOURNE	No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.

BOURNE	I have to go now.
IRENA	Is this really happening?
BOURNE	I'm sorry.

BOURNE	I emptied it.
JARDA	Felt a little light.
BOURNE	Drop it.

BOURNE	Front. Use your teeth.
JARDA	Sorry. Old habits.

BOURNE	You still should've moved.
JARDA	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.

JARDA	So why didn't you kill me then?
BOURNE	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.

JARDA	What do you want?
BOURNE	Conklin.
JARDA	He's dead.

BOURNE	Try again.
JARDA	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.

BOURNE	You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
JARDA	I don't know.
BOURNE	Who sent you to Greece?
JARDA	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
BOURNE	Pamela Landy?
JARDA	I don't know who that is.
BOURNE	What's going on in Berlin?
JARDA	I don't know! Why would I lie?

JARDA	She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
BOURNE	I did.

BOURNE	You called it in?
JARDA	I'm sorry.
BOURNE	How long? How long do I have -- 

BOURNE	-- car keys?
JARDA	-- my coat -- but we should --
BOURNE	-- what? --
JARDA	-- take the back -- get another car --

MARIE	Where were you, Jason? In the car.
BOURNE	Conklin up front.
MARIE	I'll get the book.
BOURNE	No. There's nothing new.
MARIE	You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
BOURNE	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
MARIE	-- it hasn't been two years --
BOURNE	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?

MARIE	We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
BOURNE	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.

BOURNE	I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
MARIE	I worry when you get like this.
BOURNE	It's just a nightmare.
MARIE	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.

MARIE	Sleep. Sleep now.
BOURNE	I should be better by now.
MARIE	You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
BOURNE	But it ends up the same.
MARIE	One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.

MARIE	No... How?
BOURNE	The Telegraph office.
MARIE	But we were so careful.
BOURNE	We pushed it. We got lazy.

MARIE	But you're sure?
BOURNE	He was at the campground yesterday.
MARIE	So...
BOURNE	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

MARIE	That's crazy.
BOURNE	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
MARIE	Where --
BOURNE	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --

MARIE	...but you're not -- you're not sure...
BOURNE	We can't wait to be sure.
MARIE	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
BOURNE	Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
MARIE	-- where's left to go? --
BOURNE	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!

BOURNE	You drive.
MARIE	What?
BOURNE	Switch! You drive!
MARIE	-- where? -
BOURNE	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --

MARIE	Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
BOURNE	-- not yet --
MARIE	-- it's just him? --
BOURNE	-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
MARIE	-- hang on --

BOURNE	You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
MARIE	Where are you going?
BOURNE	I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
MARIE	What if it's not who you think it is?
BOURNE	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
MARIE	There must be another way!
BOURNE	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
MARIE	Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
BOURNE	There's no choice.

MARIE	I love you, too.
BOURNE	Tell me later.

BOURNE	I wanted to kill him.
MARIE	But you found another choice.
BOURNE	I did.
MARIE	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
BOURNE	It might have.

BOURNE	I know it's a dream.
MARIE	You do?
BOURNE	I only dream about people who are dead.

BOURNE	God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
MARIE	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.

BOURNE	See that tram coming around the corner?
NICKY	Yes.
BOURNE	Get on it.

NICKY	I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
BOURNE	Who is Pamela Landy?
NICKY	You hear me? I believed you.
BOURNE	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?

BOURNE	Why is she trying to kill me?
NICKY	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!

BOURNE	How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
NICKY	What is this, a game?
BOURNE	I want to hear it from you.

BOURNE	Say it.
NICKY	Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
BOURNE	A Russian?
NICKY	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
BOURNE	Last week? When?

NICKY	And you got to him before we could.
BOURNE	I killed him???
NICKY	You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
BOURNE	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.

BOURNE	What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
NICKY	Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 

BOURNE	Why are you here, then?
NICKY	Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
BOURNE	Abbott?
NICKY	He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
BOURNE	So when was I here?
NICKY	What do you mean?
BOURNE	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
NICKY	No. You never worked Berlin.
BOURNE	My first job.
NICKY	Your first assignment was Geneva.
BOURNE	That's a lie!
NICKY	You never worked Berlin...

NICKY	No... Jason... please...
BOURNE	I was here!
NICKY	...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...

BOURNE	It's me.
PAMELA	Bourne?

PAMELA	What do you want?
BOURNE	I want to come in.

PAMELA	Okay, how do you want to do it?
BOURNE	I want someone I know to take me in.
PAMELA	Who?
BOURNE	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.

PAMELA	Okay, Jason, your move.
BOURNE	Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.

BOURNE	Where am I?
PAMELA	Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.

BOURNE	Oh, shit...
PAMELA	Careful...

BOURNE	Why am I alive?
PAMELA	Are you disappointed?

PAMELA	Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
BOURNE	What's that?
PAMELA	Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?

BOURNE	Don't need it. I remember everything.
PAMELA	Sounds like a threat.
BOURNE	You didn't answer my question.
PAMELA	Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.

PAMELA	We need to get in there.
CRONIN	I'm working on it.

CRONIN	-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
PAMELA	And the Germans can't match it?

CRONIN	Looks like he's been detained.
PAMELA	Who's going? Us?
CRONIN	There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
PAMELA	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.

CRONIN	-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
PAMELA	-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --

CRONIN	-- go -- take the van! --
PAMELA	-- the hotel -- how far? --

CRONIN	Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
PAMELA	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.

PAMELA	Alright... take it down.
CRONIN	What?
PAMELA	This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.

PAMELA	We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
CRONIN	But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.

CRONIN	You're sure?
PAMELA	What? The tapes?
CRONIN	Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...

IVAN	Show me.
VIC	Here?
IVAN	Now. Show now.

VIC	This is everything? Is there.
IVAN	Is there. Is all there.

VIC	-- who? -- who else is here? --
IVAN	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
VIC	-- shut up! -- just shut the --

MARSHALL	I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
PAMELA	That's where we came out.
MARSHALL	It's a lot of money, Pam.
PAMELA	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
MARSHALL	Still...
PAMELA	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.

MARSHALL	Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
PAMELA	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?

PAMELA/PHONE	Mr. Nevins?
NEVINS/PHONE	Who's this?
PAMELA/PHONE	Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?

PAMELA/PHONE	How long have you worked for the agency?
NEVINS/PHONE	Me? Four years.
PAMELA/PHONE	If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 

PAMELA/PHONE	I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
NEVINS/PHONE	Yes, sir -- ma'am...
PAMELA/PHONE	I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...

PAMELA	What kind of problems?
NICKY	Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
PAMELA	Amnesia?
NICKY	Before this? Before Bourne? No.

NICKY	Good luck.
PAMELA	You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.

PAMELA	I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
NICKY	Am I a doctor, no, but...
PAMELA	Are you an expert in amnesia?
NICKY	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
PAMELA	Believed what?
NICKY	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
PAMELA	So he fooled you.
NICKY	If you say so.
PAMELA	Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
NICKY	You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
PAMELA	You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
NICKY	You mean, did I want a date?
PAMELA	Did you?
NICKY	These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
PAMELA	Some women like Dobermans --
NICKY	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
PAMELA	See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.

NICKY	I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
PAMELA	And why is that?
NICKY	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.

PAMELA	Is it fresh?
NICKY	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.

PAMELA	What do you think? Is he coming in?
NICKY	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
PAMELA	Alright...

PAMELA	Let's give him half an hour.
NICKY	So?
PAMELA	Felt promising. It's a start.

PAMELA	Do we know what this says?
TEDDY	Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
PAMELA	What the hell is a "Treadstone?"

PAMELA	Anything?
TEDDY	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
PAMELA	Are we locked up?

TEDDY	Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
PAMELA	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?

TEDDY	Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
PAMELA	By who?
TEDDY	His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
PAMELA	Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...

TEDDY	We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
PAMELA	Are we hacking or asking?
TEDDY	Yes. In that order.
PAMELA	And what about you, anything?

LEADER	Someone dead from this household?
ARGYLE	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
LEADER	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
ARGYLE	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
LEADER	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
ARGYLE	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.

ARGYLE	We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
WILLIAM	I don't want to leave.
ARGYLE	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.

ARGYLE	Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
WILLIAM	It was in Latin, sir.
ARGYLE	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.

WILLIAM	What are they doing?
ARGYLE	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

CRAIG	But... what will you do?
WALLACE	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
CRAIG	Invade?! That's impossible, it --

WALLACE	A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
CRAIG	We must sue for peace.
WALLACE	Peace?!
CRAIG	We cannot defeat this --
WALLACE	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
CRAIG	It is suicide.

CRAIG	Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
WALLACE	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
CRAIG	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
WALLACE	So let the council swear publicly.
CRAIG	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.

WALLACE	I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
CRAIG	He has already agreed to come.

CRAIG	Young Robert, we are honored --
ROBERT	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
CRAIG	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.

CRAIG	A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
ROBERT	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

ROBERT	Does anyone know his politics?
CRAIG	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.

CRAIG	May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
ROBERT	He was a modest man.
CRAIG	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.

ROBERT	If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
CRAIG	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
ROBERT	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
CRAIG	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.

CRAIG	He won't come.
ROBERT	He will. I know he will.

ROBERT	Longshanks promised!
CRAIG	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.

LONGSHANKS	Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
EDWARD	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.

LONGSHANKS	What news of the north?
EDWARD	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
LONGSHANKS	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
EDWARD	I have ordered conscriptions...

EDWARD	Wallace has sacked York!
LONGSHANKS	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.

EDWARD	The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
LONGSHANKS	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.

LONGSHANKS	Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
EDWARD	The Scots will fight for us?
LONGSHANKS	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
EDWARD	But if we have not caught Wallace --
LONGSHANKS	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?

LONGSHANKS	His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
EDWARD	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.

EDWARD	What is it?!
PRINCESS	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
EDWARD	So I did! And what was so important about it?
PRINCESS	Scotland. He intends --

EDWARD	Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
PRINCESS	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
EDWARD	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!

PRINCESS	No, M'lord.
EDWARD	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!

EDWARD	Now, my flower, do you understand?
PRINCESS	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
EDWARD	You may.

PRINCESS	Good day to you, M'Lords.
EDWARD	You mock us with a smile?
PRINCESS	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
EDWARD	Wallace's followers.
PRINCESS	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.

EDWARD	The little cow is insane --
PRINCESS	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.

PRINCESS	Is it true? Wallace is captured?
EDWARD	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
PRINCESS	When will his trial be?
EDWARD	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.

PRINCESS	I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
EDWARD	You fancy him.
PRINCESS	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.

PRINCESS	Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
EDWARD	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.

HAMISH	I'll wait... back there.
WALLACE	Hamish, I... thank...

WALLACE	We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
HAMISH	Fourteen? --

HAMISH	The Bruce is not coming, William.
WALLACE	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.

WALLACE	Stephen ready?
HAMISH	Aye.

WALLACE	Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
HAMISH	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.

HAMISH	Rest, William.
WALLACE	I rest.
HAMISH	Your rest is making me exhausted.

HAMISH	You know it's a trap.
WALLACE	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
HAMISH	I don't want to be a martyr.
WALLACE	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
HAMISH	That's just a dream, William!
WALLACE	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
HAMISH	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
WALLACE	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.

HAMISH	Keep these. We're going too.
WALLACE	No. One of us is enough.

WILLIAM	They're coming!
HAMISH	How many?
WILLIAM	Three, maybe more!
HAMISH	Armed?
WILLIAM	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
HAMISH	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
WILLIAM	It's up to us, Hamish!

HAMISH	Wanna stay with me tonight?
WILLIAM	I wanna have supper waitin'.
HAMISH	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
WILLIAM	Aye, we'll get 'em.

HAMISH	Test of manhood.
WILLIAM	You win.
HAMISH	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
WILLIAM	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.

WILLIAM	I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
HAMISH	That depends on the man.

WILLIAM	Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
HAMISH	I could crush you like a roach.

HAMISH	You'll move
WILLIAM	I will not.

WILLIAM	Good to see you again.
HAMISH	I should'a remembered the eggs.

STEPHEN	All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
HAMISH	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
STEPHEN	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.

STEPHEN	Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
HAMISH	A common thief.
STEPHEN	A patriot!

STEPHEN	We must run in different directions!
HAMISH	We don't split up!
STEPHEN	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!

LEPER	I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
ROBERT	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
LEPER	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
ROBERT	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
LEPER	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
ROBERT	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
LEPER	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.

LONGSHANKS	Where is my son?
PRINCESS	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.

LONGSHANKS	I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
PRINCESS	Shall I leave, M'lord?
LONGSHANKS	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.

LONGSHANKS	My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
PRINCESS	No. He did not.
LONGSHANKS	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
PRINCESS	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
LONGSHANKS	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
PRINCESS	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
LONGSHANKS	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
PRINCESS	Humbly, M'lord.

PRINCESS	No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
LONGSHANKS	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
PRINCESS	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
LONGSHANKS	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.

PRINCESS	I have faced him. Have you?
LONGSHANKS	Let her speak.
PRINCESS	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.

WALLACE	Treason. Against whom?
MAGISTRATE	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
WALLACE	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
MAGISTRATE	It matters not, he is thy king!
WALLACE	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
MAGISTRATE	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
WALLACE	I do not confess.
MAGISTRATE	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.

WILLIAM	Your father doesn't like me, does he?
MARION	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
WILLIAM	Thank you for accepting.
MARION	Thank you for inviting.
WILLIAM	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
MARION	You are. And I'll come again.

MARION	You've been here before?
WILLIAM	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
MARION	Did it work?
WILLIAM	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.

WILLIAM	I want... to marry you!
MARION	I... accept your proposal!
WILLIAM	I'm not just saying it!
MARION	Nor I!
WILLIAM	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
MARION	You scare me.
WILLIAM	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
MARION	This night is too beautiful to have again.
WILLIAM	I will be with you, like this. Forever.

WILLIAM	I've missed you.
MARION	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
WILLIAM	Tonight then.
MARION	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!

WILLIAM	Then when?
MARION	...Tonight!

WALLACE	I'm dreaming.
MARION	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
WALLACE	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
MARION	And I with you. But you must wake.
WALLACE	I need you so much! I love you!
MARION	Wake up, William. Wake up!

NICOLETTE	When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
PRINCESS	How do you know this?
NICOLETTE	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
PRINCESS	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
NICOLETTE	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.

PRINCESS	This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
NICOLETTE	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.

NICOLETTE	Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
PRINCESS	...I wouldn't know.

PRINCESS	I am the Princess of Wales.
WALLACE	Wife of Edward, the king's son?

PRINCESS	I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
WALLACE	It's battle I want, not talk.
PRINCESS	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?

PRINCESS	I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
WALLACE	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
PRINCESS	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
WALLACE	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
PRINCESS	That is not possible.

PRINCESS	Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
WALLACE	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
PRINCESS	Peace is made is such ways.
WALLACE	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!

PRINCESS	I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
WALLACE	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.

WALLACE	A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
PRINCESS	It does me good to see you.

WALLACE	Why did you?
PRINCESS	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.

WALLACE	You have... you have a husband.
PRINCESS	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.

PRINCESS	You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
WALLACE	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
PRINCESS	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?

WALLACE	M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
PRINCESS	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
WALLACE	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
PRINCESS	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
WALLACE	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.

PRINCESS	You will die! It will be awful!
WALLACE	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.

PRINCESS	Drink this! It will dull your pain.
WALLACE	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
PRINCESS	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!

ROBERT	Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
WALLACE	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
ROBERT	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
WALLACE	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.

ROBERT	I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
WALLACE	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.

WALLACE	War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
ROBERT	I am trying.
WALLACE	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
ROBERT	I must... consult with my father.
WALLACE	And I will consult with mine.

STEPHEN	We can't stop!
WALLACE	They've tricked us.
STEPHEN	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
WALLACE	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
STEPHEN	Who would do such a thing?
WALLACE	Exactly.

STEPHEN	I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
WALLACE	No English lord would trust an Irishman!

STEPHEN	Fine speech. Now what do we do?
WALLACE	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.

STEPHEN	Come, it'll help you sleep.
WALLACE	Aye. But it won't let me dream.

LUCILLA	Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
COMMODUS	We're nearly there, Lucilla.
LUCILLA	That's what you told me two days ago!
COMMODUS	Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
LUCILLA	I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.

COMMODUS	More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
LUCILLA	I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
COMMODUS	Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.

COMMODUS	Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
LUCILLA	And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!

LUCILLA	Don't you think you should at least wave?
COMMODUS	Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?

COMMODUS	They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
LUCILLA	Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.

COMMODUS	I should at least have you, don't you think?
LUCILLA	If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.

COMMODUS	Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
LUCILLA	I'm sure, I don't know.

LUCILLA	No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
COMMODUS	Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.

LUCILLA	Those are priceless sculptures.
COMMODUS	I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!

COMMODUS	It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
LUCILLA	Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.

COMMODUS	How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
LUCILLA	If I may be so bold...
COMMODUS	For the gods, spit it out!
LUCILLA	Why not do it in the Colosseum?

COMMODUS	Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
LUCILLA	You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.

COMMODUS	Tribuus... tomorrow.
LUCILLA	You're coming back?
COMMODUS	I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?

COMMODUS	Where have you been?
LUCILLA	Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
COMMODUS	You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
LUCILLA	Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
COMMODUS	What is that... wailing?
LUCILLA	The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.

COMMODUS	Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
LUCILLA	What are you talking about?
COMMODUS	Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
LUCILLA	If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
COMMODUS	But I get what I want, always, don't I?

LUCILLA	... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast...
COMMODUS	Yes?  Go on!
LUCILLA	... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?

COMMODUS	Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
LUCILLA	You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
COMMODUS	I want that bastard dead!
LUCILLA	You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
COMMODUS	I am their hero!
LUCILLA	Not yet, dear brother...
COMMODUS	Send them out!

COMMODUS	Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
LUCILLA	Do you want posters, too?

COMMODUS	Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
LUCILLA	You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
COMMODUS	What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.

COMMODUS	Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
NARCISSUS	Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
COMMODUS	Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.

NARCISSUS	Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
COMMODUS	That's difficult to say, general.
NARCISSUS	Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.

COMMODUS	Then you'd be out of a job.
NARCISSUS	Gladly Caesar.
COMMODUS	Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...

NARCISSUS	I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
COMMODUS	Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?

COMMODUS	I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
NARCISSUS	The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.

NARCISSUS	But they're not destroyed, not yet.
COMMODUS	Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.

COMMODUS	You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
NARCISSUS	You flatter me, Caesar.
COMMODUS	Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
NARCISSUS	Caesar?
COMMODUS	That this illness has clouded his mind.

COMMODUS	I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
NARCISSUS	We have to stop the Germans now!

NARCISSUS	Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
COMMODUS	They won't break this one.
NARCISSUS	Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.

NARCISSUS	Where is my family?
COMMODUS	Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
NARCISSUS	And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.

COMMODUS	The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
NARCISSUS	On what charge?

COMMODUS	Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
NARCISSUS	If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.

FALCO	Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
COMMODUS	Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.

FALCO	The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
COMMODUS	How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...

FALCO	Caesar, ignore them.
COMMODUS	Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
FALCO	At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...

COMMODUS	Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
FALCO	Until your confirmation date.

FALCO	And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
COMMODUS	At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...

COMMODUS	Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
FALCO	Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
COMMODUS	Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
FALCO	I'm serious.
COMMODUS	So am I.
FALCO	We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
COMMODUS	Give away food?
FALCO	Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
COMMODUS	Take grain away from the army?
FALCO	Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.

FALCO	Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
COMMODUS	I wouldn't know who to bet on.

QUINTUS	Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
COMMODUS	I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.

QUINTUS	Marcus Aurelius has died.
COMMODUS	He left us at dawn.

QUINTUS	We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
COMMODUS	I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.

COMMODUS	This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
QUINTUS	Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.

QUINTUS	It's because he comes off as the underdog.
COMMODUS	Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
QUINTUS	You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.

COMMODUS	Where is my father?
TRIBUUS	Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?

COMMODUS	Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
TRIBUUS	He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.

COMMODUS	Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
TRIBUUS	Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...

TRIBUUS	Yes, Caesar?
COMMODUS	Jerses -- tomorrow...

COMMODUS	Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
TRIBUUS	Yes, Caesar.
COMMODUS	We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...

COS	You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
PROXIMO	This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
COS	I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?

COS	Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens.  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
PROXIMO	Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

PROXIMO	Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
COS	I don't know...
PROXIMO	AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
COS	I'll nose around...
PROXIMO	You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...

COS	So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
NARCISSUS	That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
COS	I am prepared to write anything you tell me.

NARCISSUS	My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
COS	The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!

NARCISSUS	The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
COS	That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
NARCISSUS	Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?

NARCISSUS	It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
COS	Yes, because I know they'll read it.

NARCISSUS	The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
FALCO	God of passages and changes?
NARCISSUS	I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
FALCO	You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
NARCISSUS	I've read of it.
FALCO	But have never been?
NARCISSUS	My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.

NARCISSUS	I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
GAIUS	Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?

NARCISSUS	A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
GAIUS	The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
NARCISSUS	We all know what right is, Senator.

NARCISSUS	The Senate too?
GAIUS	The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
NARCISSUS	I hope you live to see what I believe...

GRACCHUS	Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
NARCISSUS	You're hearing about somebody else.
GRACCHUS	How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
NARCISSUS	When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
GRACCHUS	Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
NARCISSUS	I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
GRACCHUS	You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
NARCISSUS	You don't know how wrong you are.

JUBA	You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
NARCISSUS	Why you?
JUBA	My loyalties... were in doubt.
NARCISSUS	Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
JUBA	That's what worries me...

JUBA	Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
NARCISSUS	They can't... if this is Rome...

NARCISSUS	No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
LUCILLA	Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.

LUCILLA	You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
NARCISSUS	Only from a distance.

LUCILLA	I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
NARCISSUS	Sneaking around with your brother?
LUCILLA	Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
NARCISSUS	I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
LUCILLA	Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
NARCISSUS	Why do you play at being drunk?
LUCILLA	How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
NARCISSUS	I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
LUCILLA	Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.

LUCILLA	It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
NARCISSUS	Yours will do!

LUCILLA	I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
NARCISSUS	You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
LUCILLA	But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.

NARCISSUS	Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
LUCILLA	For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.

NARCISSUS	To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
LUCILLA	Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?

LUCILLA	If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But...
NARCISSUS	But what if I wish to be purple?

LUCILLA	You cannot die.
NARCISSUS	Would that Marcus had lived.
LUCILLA	Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
NARCISSUS	He killed his father and then my family...
LUCILLA	Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.

NARCISSUS	Where are they?
LUCILLA	Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.

MARCUS AURELIUS	Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
NARCISSUS	The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
MARCUS AURELIUS	Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!

MARCUS AURELIUS	I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
NARCISSUS	I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
MARCUS AURELIUS	I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
NARCISSUS	There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
MARCUS AURELIUS	Servis made it through again?
NARCISSUS	He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.

MARCUS AURELIUS	If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
NARCISSUS	Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
MARCUS AURELIUS	It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
NARCISSUS	So I understand.
MARCUS AURELIUS	Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
NARCISSUS	You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
MARCUS AURELIUS	A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
NARCISSUS	Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
MARCUS AURELIUS	The Senators admire you.
NARCISSUS	They fear me.
MARCUS AURELIUS	They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
NARCISSUS	I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.

THEMIS	I made the plume from a quail feather.
NARCISSUS	Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.

NARCISSUS	Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
THEMIS	Tomorrow?
NARCISSUS	As soon as I can.
THEMIS	On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
NARCISSUS	On my honor as your daddy...

QUINTUS	I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
NARCISSUS	Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.

NARCISSUS	What the hell was all that about?
QUINTUS	What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
NARCISSUS	Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
QUINTUS	Well, we can try...

QUINTUS	Serious stuff...
NARCISSUS	Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.

QUINTUS	Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
NARCISSUS	What deal?
QUINTUS	Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.

NARCISSUS	Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
QUINTUS	My troops don't make policy.
NARCISSUS	Well, they die for it!

NARCISSUS	On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
QUINTUS	I can't let you do that.

NARCISSUS	You brought the army into Rome.
QUINTUS	I was summoned.
NARCISSUS	It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
QUINTUS	It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
NARCISSUS	Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
QUINTUS	You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
NARCISSUS	Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
QUINTUS	The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!

QUINTUS	What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
NARCISSUS	Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?

NARCISSUS	He's very realistic.
SELENE	Isn't the helmet magnificent?

SELENE	Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
NARCISSUS	Greeks?
SELENE	Athenians...

NARCISSUS	What about their philosophy lessons?
SELENE	They're studying with Cynics.
NARCISSUS	Of course...

SELENE	You need to come home!
NARCISSUS	I can see that...
SELENE	The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
NARCISSUS	If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.

NARCISSUS	This is our oil from our estates?
SELENE	I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.

NARCISSUS	Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
SELENE	Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
NARCISSUS	I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
SELENE	We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.

NARCISSUS	I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
SELENE	Let him trust Quintus.
NARCISSUS	Quintus is overly idealistic.
SELENE	I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
NARCISSUS	Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
SELENE	I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
NARCISSUS	What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.

NARCISSUS	When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
SELENE	No!

SELENE	You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
NARCISSUS	How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
SELENE	Narcissus!
NARCISSUS	Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
SELENE	I don't want you to die!

NARCISSUS	I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
SELENE	Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
NARCISSUS	They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
SELENE	You teach them!
NARCISSUS	That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...

PROXIMO	You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
NARCISSUS	I killed too many barbarians.
PROXIMO	I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.

NARCISSUS	Who the hell are you?
PROXIMO	I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
NARCISSUS	Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
PROXIMO	General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
NARCISSUS	Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!

NARCISSUS	Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
PROXIMO	You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
NARCISSUS	Death is a very light thing for you.
PROXIMO	Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.

NARCISSUS	Take your hands off me animal!
PROXIMO	Chain him.

PROXIMO	Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
NARCISSUS	I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
PROXIMO	-- to fight?  We'll see...

PROXIMO	Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
NARCISSUS	I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
PROXIMO	Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...

PROXIMO	General, do you realize what happened out there today?
NARCISSUS	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
PROXIMO	That's one way to look at it.

PROXIMO	At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
NARCISSUS	What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
PROXIMO	Think about it!  Just think about it!

PROXIMO	General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
NARCISSUS	Alive... I'm alive...

NARCISSUS	Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
PROXIMO	Don't be ridiculous.

PROXIMO	It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
NARCISSUS	Lucky it didn't step on his head.

PROXIMO	No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
NARCISSUS	Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...

PROXIMO	Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
NARCISSUS	What the hell are you talking about, Greek?

PROXIMO	You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
NARCISSUS	So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
PROXIMO	You get to come alive again in the country!
NARCISSUS	As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
PROXIMO	The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
NARCISSUS	Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
PROXIMO	But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
NARCISSUS	Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
PROXIMO	It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!

NARCISSUS	Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
PROXIMO	On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
NARCISSUS	Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
PROXIMO	Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!

NARCISSUS	How much money is involved?
PROXIMO	A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
NARCISSUS	They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
PROXIMO	I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
NARCISSUS	No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
PROXIMO	Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
NARCISSUS	Then get a large cash advance.
PROXIMO	Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
NARCISSUS	Before they leave, get gold.
PROXIMO	Right, right, what am I thinking of?
NARCISSUS	I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
PROXIMO	I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!

PROXIMO	So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
NARCISSUS	You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
PROXIMO	Was I?

PROXIMO	Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
NARCISSUS	I want nothing to do with the arena.
PROXIMO	Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?

NARCISSUS	Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
PROXIMO	Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.

BRODY	Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
SALLAH	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
BRODY	Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
SALLAH	You are on your own?

BRODY	Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
SALLAH	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
BRODY	Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...

BRODY	Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
SALLAH	And I am his.

BRODY	My reputation precedes me.
SALLAH	There is no museum in Iskenderun.

BRODY	Yes.
SALLAH	Papers, sir. Got it here.

BRODY	Yes.
SALLAH	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
BRODY	Did you say...? Uh, uh...

BRODY	May we go home now, please?
SALLAH	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...

INDY	Marcus!  I did it!
BRODY	You've got it!

INDY	You know how long I've been looking for that?!
BRODY	All your life.
INDY	All my life!
BRODY	Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.

INDY	Your treat.
BRODY	Yes. My treat.

BRODY	What has the old fool got himself into now?
INDY	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!

INDY	Dad?
BRODY	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.

INDY	Venice, Italy!
BRODY	What is it?

INDY	It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
BRODY	I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
INDY	Do you believe, Marcus?

INDY	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
BRODY	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.

BRODY	But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
INDY	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
BRODY	I'll tell him we'll take two.

INDY	Ah, Venice...
BRODY	Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
INDY	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

INDY	That doesn't look much like a library.
BRODY	It looks like a converted church.

INDY	Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
BRODY	Where?

BRODY	Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
INDY	Dad was onto something here!
BRODY	Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.

INDY	How's the head?
BRODY	It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

INDY	The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
BRODY	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.

BRODY	Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
INDY	Alexandretta. Now we know.
BRODY	Yes. Now we know.
INDY	Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

BRODY	What about you?
INDY	I'm going after Dad.

BRODY	Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
INDY	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.

HENRY	Marcus!
BRODY	Arghhh! Oh!

BRODY	Henry! What are you doing here?!
HENRY	It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

BRODY	Henry, the pen --
HENRY	What?
BRODY	But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.

BRODY	Look what you did!
HENRY	It's war.

HENRY	The Word of God...
BRODY	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
HENRY	The Name of God...

BRODY	Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
HENRY	Got lost in his own museum, huh?

BRODY	Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
DONOVAN	Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
BRODY	Schneider?
DONOVAN	I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
BRODY	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.

DONOVAN	Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
BRODY	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...

DONOVAN	Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
BRODY	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.

BUTLER	Are you expected?
INDY	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
BUTLER	Tapestries?
INDY	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
BUTLER	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
INDY	How dare he?!

DONOVAN	My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
INDY	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
DONOVAN	Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.

INDY	Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
DONOVAN	That was our assessment as well.
INDY	Where did this come from?
DONOVAN	My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?

INDY	Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
DONOVAN	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.

INDY	The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
DONOVAN	Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
INDY	An old man's dream.
DONOVAN	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.

DONOVAN	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
INDY	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
DONOVAN	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.

DONOVAN	Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
INDY	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
DONOVAN	Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

DONOVAN	This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
INDY	That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
DONOVAN	You could be more right than you know.
INDY	Yes?
DONOVAN	We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
INDY	You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
DONOVAN	We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.

INDY	DONOVAN!
DONOVAN	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?

DONOVAN	Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
INDY	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
DONOVAN	Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
INDY	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
DONOVAN	You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.

INDY	I'm through!
DONOVAN	We're through!

ELSA	Doctor Jones?
INDY	Yes?
ELSA	I knew it was you --

INDY	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
ELSA	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.

ELSA	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
INDY	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!

INDY	Fraulein -- will you permit me?
ELSA	I usually don't.
INDY	I usually don't either.
ELSA	In that case, I permit you.

INDY	It would make me very happy.
ELSA	But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
INDY	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

INDY	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
ELSA	Find something?

INDY	Bingo.
ELSA	You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
INDY	Except he's lost, and I'm not.
ELSA	Lower me down.

ELSA	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
INDY	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
ELSA	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.

INDY	The Ark of the Covenant.
ELSA	Are you sure?
INDY	Pretty sure.

INDY	It must be one of these...
ELSA	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.

ELSA	What's that?
INDY	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.

ELSA	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
INDY	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!

INDY	Don't wander off.
ELSA	What?

INDY	I said go around!
ELSA	You said go between them!
INDY	I said don't go between them!

ELSA	My room!
INDY	Mine, too.
ELSA	What were they looking for?

INDY	This.
ELSA	The Grail Diary.
INDY	Uh-huh.
ELSA	You had it? You didn't trust me!

INDY	At least I let you tag along.
ELSA	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
INDY	Knock it off. You're not mad.
ELSA	No?
INDY	No. You like the way I do things.
ELSA	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.

INDY	What do you know about this place?
ELSA	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.

ELSA	What are you going to do?
INDY	Don't know. Think of something.

INDY	This one. I think he's in here.
ELSA	How do you know?

ELSA	This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
INDY	So it did.

ELSA	How did you get here?
INDY	Where is it? I want it.

ELSA	You came back for the book? Why?
INDY	My father didn't want it incinerated.

ELSA	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
INDY	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
ELSA	You do.

INDY	All I have to do is squeeze.
ELSA	All I have to do is scream.

ELSA	I never expected to see you again.
INDY	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.

INDY	Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
ELSA	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
INDY	Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.

INDY	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
ELSA	I can reach it. I can reach it...

INDY	Dad!
HENRY	Out!
INDY	It's important!
HENRY	Then wait -- count to twenty.
INDY	No, Dad. You listen to me --
HENRY	Junior!

HENRY	It is you Junior!
INDY	Don't call me that, please.
HENRY	But what are you doing here?
INDY	I came to get you! What do you think?

HENRY	Oh, it breaks the heart.
INDY	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
HENRY	I'll never forgive myself --
INDY	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
HENRY	Thank God!

INDY	No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
HENRY	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
INDY	Dad, they come in through the doors.
HENRY	Good point.

HENRY	Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
INDY	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
HENRY	Through the library?
INDY	Right.
HENRY	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?

INDY	Found it.
HENRY	He was actually there? You saw him?
INDY	Well, what was left of him.
HENRY	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
INDY	Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
HENRY	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...

HENRY	...you did it.
INDY	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
HENRY	If only I could have been with you.
INDY	There were rats, Dad.
HENRY	Rats?
INDY	Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
HENRY	They want my diary.
INDY	Yeah?

HENRY	You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
INDY	Well, uh...
HENRY	You did!!
INDY	Look, can we discuss this later?
HENRY	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
INDY	Will you take it easy!
HENRY	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
INDY	I came here to save you.
HENRY	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??

INDY	No! Don't Shoot!
HENRY	Don't worry. He won't.

INDY	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
HENRY	Umh?
INDY	How did you she was a Nazi?
HENRY	She talks in her sleep.

INDY	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
HENRY	So did I.
INDY	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
HENRY	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
INDY	Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!

HENRY	What am I looking for?
INDY	My lucky charm.
HENRY	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
INDY	Try and burn through the ropes.

HENRY	I ought to tell you something.
INDY	Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
HENRY	The floor's on fire! See?!
INDY	What???
HENRY	And the chair.
INDY	All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.

INDY	Dad!
HENRY	What?
INDY	Dad!
HENRY	What?
INDY	Dad!

HENRY	What?
INDY	Head for the fireplace!
HENRY	Oh.

HENRY	This is intolerable!
INDY	I'm out, Dad!

INDY	Dad!
HENRY	...the solution presents itself.

INDY	Come on, Dad. Come on!
HENRY	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?

HENRY	Stop!
INDY	What?
HENRY	Stop! Stop!

HENRY	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
INDY	Brody's this way.
HENRY	My Diary's in Berlin.
INDY	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
HENRY	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
INDY	All right Dad -- tell me.
HENRY	Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
INDY	What final challenge?
HENRY	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
INDY	Booby traps?
HENRY	Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
INDY	But what are they? Can't you remember?
HENRY	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
INDY	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
HENRY	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
INDY	What about Marcus?
HENRY	Marcus would agree with me.
INDY	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!

HENRY	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
INDY	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
HENRY	Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.

HENRY	What did you get?
INDY	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
HENRY	Good.

HENRY	When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
INDY	Relax.

HENRY	You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
INDY	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
HENRY	Well, I'm as human as the next man.
INDY	I was the next man.
HENRY	Ships that pass in the night...

INDY	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
HENRY	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
INDY	We didn't talk. We never talked.
HENRY	And do I detect a rebuke?
INDY	A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
HENRY	Actually, I was a wonderful father.
INDY	When?

HENRY	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
INDY	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
HENRY	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
INDY	Dad, how can you?
HENRY	Very well. I'm here now.

INDY	Well... I can't think of anything.
HENRY	Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
INDY	What does that mean?
HENRY	I don't know. We'll find out.

HENRY	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
INDY	Fly... yes. Land... no.

INDY	Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
HENRY	What happens at eleven o'clock?

INDY	Dad, are we hit?!
HENRY	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

HENRY	Nice landing.
INDY	Thanks.

HENRY	Those people are trying to kill us!
INDY	I know, Dad!
HENRY	It's a new experience for me.
INDY	It happens to me all the time.

HENRY	This is intolerable!
INDY	This could be close.

HENRY	What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
INDY	Dad, we're well out of range.

HENRY	Now, who are all these people?
INDY	Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

INDY	Dad?
HENRY	You call this archaeology?
INDY	Get out of there, Dad!

INDY	Dad?!
HENRY	Junior...

HENRY	Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.
INDY	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
HENRY	The penitent man. The penitent...

INDY	The penitent man is humble before God.
HENRY	Penitent. Penitent...
INDY	The penitent man is humble...

HENRY	But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
INDY	J.

HENRY	Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
INDY	I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.

HENRY	Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
INDY	What did you find, Dad?
HENRY	Me?... Illumination.

HENRY	What did you find, Junior?
INDY	Junior?! Dad...

INDY	I like Indiana.
HENRY	We named the dog Indiana.

INDY	Ready?
HENRY	Ready.

INDY	Uh-huh.
HENRY	After you, Junior.
INDY	Yes, sir!  Haaa!

KNIGHT	I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
INDY	Who are you?
KNIGHT	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
INDY	That was seven hundred years ago.
KNIGHT	A long time to wait.

KNIGHT	You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
INDY	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
KNIGHT	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.

SALLAH	Get that camel out of the way!
INDY	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
SALLAH	Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.

SALLAH	That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
INDY	Come on -- come on!

INDY	I'm going after those horses.
SALLAH	I'll take the camels.
INDY	I don't need camels.
SALLAH	But, Indy --
INDY	No camels!

INDY	Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
SALLAH	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
INDY	Where's my father?
SALLAH	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

INDY	Why are you trying to kill us?
KAZIM	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
INDY	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
KAZIM	No.
INDY	Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
KAZIM	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
INDY	Then we'll die.
KAZIM	My soul is prepared. How's yours?

INDY	This is your last chance.
KAZIM	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

INDY	All right! Where's my father
KAZIM	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
INDY	Who are you?
KAZIM	My name is Kazim.
INDY	And why were you trying to kill me?
KAZIM	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.

KAZIM	Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
INDY	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
KAZIM	In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.

CHATTAR LAL	Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Just a routine inspection tour.
CHATTAR LAL	The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.

CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
CHATTAR LAL	I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Interested in local curios?
INDIANA	No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Charming.
INDIANA	It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
INDIANA	You think so?
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.

INDIANA	You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.

INDIANA	The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
INDIANA	Something magical. A sacred rock.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
INDIANA	Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...

INDIANA	I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Miss Scott panicked?
INDIANA	When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.

INDIANA	Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	I believe we're being called to dinner.
WILLIE	Finally!

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
WILLIE	No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
CAPT. BLUMBURTT	What?
WILLIE	We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!

CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Who?
WILLIE	It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.

WILLIE	Hard to believe, isn't it...?
CHATTAR LAL	I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

CHATTAR LAL	The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
WILLIE	You should have been there...

WILLIE	He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
CHATTAR LAL	No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
WILLIE	Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?

CHATTAR LAL	They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
WILLIE	Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!

WILLIE	Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
CHATTAR LAL	His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
WILLIE	No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...

CHATTAR LAL	Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
WILLIE	I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!

CHATTAR LAL	I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
WILLIE	What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!

CHATTAR LAL	I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
INDIANA	Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?

INDIANA	We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
CHATTAR LAL	I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.

INDIANA	I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
CHATTAR LAL	A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
INDIANA	Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.

INDIANA	I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
CHATTAR LAL	There are no stories anymore.
INDIANA	Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.

CHATTAR LAL	Their stories are just fear and folklore.
INDIANA	Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?

INDIANA	You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
INDIANA	Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.

CHATTAR LAL	There, you see, Captain. A rock!
INDIANA	When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
CHATTAR LAL	I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...

INDIANA	I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
INDIANA	The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
CHATTAR LAL	And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
INDIANA	That was a misunderstanding.
CHATTAR LAL	Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

CHATTAR LAL	Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
INDIANA	Yes, I understand.

CHATTAR LAL	You understand what he tells us?
INDIANA	Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!

LAO	Dr. Jones.
INDIANA	Lao She.
LAO	Nee chin lie how ma?

LAO	You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
INDIANA	I don't like to show off.

LAO	So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
INDIANA	Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.

LAO	You have insulted my son.
INDIANA	Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
LAO	Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

INDIANA	What's that?
LAO	A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.

INDIANA	Now what about the antidote, Lao.
LAO	At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!

SHORT ROUND	Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
INDIANA	Step on it, Short Round!
SHORT ROUND	Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!

INDIANA	You got the tickets, Short Round?
SHORT ROUND	Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --

SHORT ROUND	Indy?
INDIANA	Okay, Shorty.

SHORT ROUND	Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
INDIANA	It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.

SHORT ROUND	I ride with you, Indy?
INDIANA	Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.

SHORT ROUND	Indy, look!
INDIANA	That's it. Pankot Palace.

SHORT ROUND	What you look at, Indy?
INDIANA	Just a statue.

SHORT ROUND	That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
INDIANA	You don't like him do you?
SHORT ROUND	Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
INDIANA	No.
SHORT ROUND	Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!

INDIANA	He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
SHORT ROUND	Yeah, that's what happened...

SHORT ROUND	Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
INDIANA	Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.

SHORT ROUND	What does it mean, Indy?
INDIANA	Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth.

INDIANA	The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
SHORT ROUND	Why they glow like that?
INDIANA	Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.

SHORT ROUND	This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
INDIANA	Why?

INDIANA	Come one, what's wrong?
SHORT ROUND	Behind you!

INDIANA	Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
SHORT ROUND	Read you loud and clear, Indy!

INDIANA	Let up on the brake!
SHORT ROUND	What?

MOLA RAM	You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
INDIANA	Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.

MOLA RAM	There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
INDIANA	Two are still missing.
MOLA RAM	No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
INDIANA	That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
MOLA RAM	They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
INDIANA	Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
MOLA RAM	You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.

INDIANA	That's far enough!
MOLA RAM	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.

MOLA RAM	Give me the stones!
INDIANA	Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!

MOLA RAM	No, the stones are mine!
INDIANA	You're betrayed Shiva. 

SHAMAN	On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
INDIANA	Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
SHAMAN	You will go to palace there.
INDIANA	Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
SHAMAN	No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.

SHAMAN	It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
INDIANA	I don't understand. What's happened here?
SHAMAN	The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
INDIANA	What evil?
SHAMAN	They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.

SHAMAN	It is why Krishna brought you here.
INDIANA	Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
SHAMAN	No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.

INDIANA	Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
SHAMAN	Long ago -- before my father's father.
INDIANA	And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.

INDIANA	But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
SHAMAN	They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.

SHAMAN	You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
INDIANA	I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.

INDIANA	I like the service here.
WILLIE	Hey, he's not a waiter...
INDIANA	No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.

INDIANA	Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
WILLIE	Who cares? Where's that diamond!

WILLIE	For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
INDIANA	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

WILLIE	Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
INDIANA	Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?

WILLIE	You don't look very good.
INDIANA	Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!

WILLIE	What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
INDIANA	The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!

WILLIE	I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
INDIANA	Siam.
WILLIE	Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...

WILLIE	So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
INDIANA	Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?

WILLIE	I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
INDIANA	Oh yeah?

WILLIE	Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
INDIANA	Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!

INDIANA	You all right?
WILLIE	No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?

INDIANA	India...
WILLIE	Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --

WILLIE	What'd he say?
INDIANA	He told me they knew I was coming here.
WILLIE	What do you mean -- how?
INDIANA	The old man saw it in a dream.
WILLIE	Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
INDIANA	He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.

WILLIE	God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
INDIANA	That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...

WILLIE	Took what?
INDIANA	It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.

INDIANA	And then they took their children.
WILLIE	Their children?

WILLIE	What'd he say now?
INDIANA	It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...

INDIANA	Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
WILLIE	Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
INDIANA	Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
WILLIE	Somehow I feel safer in here.

WILLIE	Indy! Help me!
INDIANA	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
WILLIE	A snake!

INDIANA	A what...?
WILLIE	A SNAKE!!

WILLIE	Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
INDIANA	Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
WILLIE	What?!
INDIANA	First of all -- don't panic!

INDIANA	Don't let it pull you deeper!
WILLIE	It's pulling me deeper!
INDIANA	Don't let it curl around you!
WILLIE	It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!

INDIANA	Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
WILLIE	What?!
INDIANA	Can you move your arm?
WILLIE	Just one arm!
INDIANA	Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
WILLIE	PET IT??!!
INDIANA	Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
WILLIE	THE WHAT?!
INDIANA	Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!

WILLIE	Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
INDIANA	Keep stroking it!

INDIANA	What's happening?
WILLIE	It's starting to let go!
INDIANA	That's good -- you're doing fine.

WILLIE	Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
INDIANA	I know the feeling...

WILLIE	Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
INDIANA	I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.

INDIANA	Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
WILLIE	He'll be okay. He's a good kid.

INDIANA	By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
WILLIE	Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.

INDIANA	What about the future?
WILLIE	Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.

INDIANA	I'd like to find one of those myself.
WILLIE	Oh really?
INDIANA	Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
WILLIE	Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
INDIANA	Maybe...

INDIANA	The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
WILLIE	What does the writing say?
INDIANA	It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
WILLIE	That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
INDIANA	Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
WILLIE	You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?

INDIANA	I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
WILLIE	I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.

INDIANA	Couldn't keep away, huh?
WILLIE	Just try and control yourself.

WILLIE	He's afraid of something.
INDIANA	He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
WILLIE	You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?

INDIANA	Any more complaints?
WILLIE	Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...

INDIANA	I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
WILLIE	She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.

WILLIE	That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
INDIANA	Maybe he likes older women.

INDIANA	Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
WILLIE	I've never been so hungry in my life...

WILLIE	Not leftovers?
INDIANA	No -- real food.

WILLIE	You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
INDIANA	Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?

WILLIE	Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
INDIANA	I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --

WILLIE	Primitive sexual practices?
INDIANA	You're talking to an authority in that area.

WILLIE	You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
INDIANA	You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
WILLIE	Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
INDIANA	I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...

WILLIE	We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
INDIANA	Don't catch cold.
WILLIE	Dr. Jones?

WILLIE	Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
INDIANA	You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.

WILLIE	No -- don't you see -- crawling --
INDIANA	What -- the bug?

WILLIE	Get -- the -- bug -- off!
INDIANA	Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!

WILLIE	Oh no -- oh no!!
INDIANA	You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
WILLIE	Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!

WILLIE	What?!
INDIANA	Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!

INDIANA	WILLIE?!
WILLIE	I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!

WILLIE	There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
INDIANA	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!

INDIANA	GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
WILLIE	A what?!

INDIANA	A fulcrum release lever!
WILLIE	I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!

WILLIE	There's a hole! I found a square hole!
INDIANA	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
WILLIE	I am -- it looks horrible!

WILLIE	Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
INDIANA	Willie!

WILLIE	What is it...?
INDIANA	It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.

WILLIE	Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
INDIANA	No... the heart's still beating!

WILLIE	Let's go! Let's get out of here!
INDIANA	Quiet!

WILLIE	Wait -- what're you doing?
INDIANA	I'm going down.
WILLIE	Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
INDIANA	I'm not leaving without those stones.
WILLIE	You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
INDIANA	Maybe... someday.  Not today.

INDIANA	It's okay. You're all right now.
WILLIE	They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...

WILLIE	What?
INDIANA	You've got to go to sleep now.
WILLIE	I want to go home...
INDIANA	I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...

WILLIE	Indy? Did you talk to them?
INDIANA	Yes.
WILLIE	So now they believe me.
INDIANA	Yes, they believe you.

WILLIE	I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
INDIANA	No... they won't kill me.
WILLIE	You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...

WILLIE	What're we going to do?!
INDIANA	There's got to be another way out.

WILLIE	I can't!
INDIANA	Go!

INDIANA	Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
WILLIE	What above the curves?!

WILLIE	Anymore ideas...?
INDIANA	Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!

WILLIE	I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
INDIANA	Not quite.

INDIANA	The last Sankara Stone.
WILLIE	And they don't even know what it really is.
INDIANA	Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
WILLIE	You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
INDIANA	It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.

SHORT ROUND	I get it!
WILLIE	You got it!

WILLIE	This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
SHORT ROUND	They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
WILLIE	Figures...
SHORT ROUND	They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.

WILLIE	Give me your hat...
SHORT ROUND	What for?
WILLIE	I'm going to puke in it...

WILLIE	I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
SHORT ROUND	Willie, come on!

ANDERTON	Wally!
AGATHA	Can you see?

ANDERTON	I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
AGATHA	Is it now?
ANDERTON	What?
AGATHA	Is it now?

ANDERTON	What?
AGATHA	They're inside.
ANDERTON	Who?

AGATHA	Take it.
ANDERTON	Agatha...

ANDERTON	Agatha --
AGATHA	Can you see the balloon man?
ANDERTON	What?

AGATHA	Drop some money.
ANDERTON	Forget that guy --
AGATHA	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.

AGATHA	No.  Follow him.
ANDERTON	He'll turn around.
AGATHA	He won't.

ANDERTON	Agatha...
AGATHA	Wait.

ANDERTON	He's here.
AGATHA	Anderton, leave.

ANDERTON	I can't.  I have to know.
AGATHA	Please --
ANDERTON	I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.

ANDERTON	Oh, God...
AGATHA	What is it?

ANDERTON	Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
AGATHA	Anderton --
ANDERTON	You were right.  I'm not being set up.

AGATHA	Please, I want to go back...
ANDERTON	I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
AGATHA	But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.

AGATHA	Where are we going?
ANDERTON	Someplace safe.
AGATHA	I have to go back.
ANDERTON	Why?
AGATHA	The other two will die without me.
ANDERTON	You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?

AGATHA	I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
ANDERTON	Agatha, you're never going back there.
AGATHA	I am going back.  I see myself there.

AGATHA	Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
ANDERTON	Who wanted her little girl back?
AGATHA	The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
ANDERTON	She died?
AGATHA	She grew up.
ANDERTON	She's still alive?

AGATHA	She's not alive, but she didn't die.
ANDERTON	Oh, Jesus...

AGATHA	I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
ANDERTON	What --
AGATHA	RUN!

ANDERTON	-- but he didn't.
LARA	Then who was he?
ANDERTON	Just some guy... they found.
LARA	Found?  Where?
ANDERTON	Somewhere.

LARA	Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
ANDERTON	Because I found out about her...
LARA	About who?
ANDERTON	Anne Lively...

ANDERTON	I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
LARA	I know... I do, too...

LARA	John?  What is it?
ANDERTON	How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?

DR. EDDIE	Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
ANDERTON	That's comforting.
DR. EDDIE	You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
ANDERTON	Right.  I know --

DR. EDDIE	Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
ANDERTON	Yeah --
DR. EDDIE	And replace them with new ones.
ANDERTON	I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
DR. EDDIE	Why?
ANDERTON	Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
DR. EDDIE	Whatever you say, John.

DR. EDDIE	That's not much.
ANDERTON	It's all I could safely move.
DR. EDDIE	Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?

DR. EDDIE	You don't remember me, do you?
ANDERTON	We know each other?
DR. EDDIE	Oh, yes.

ANDERTON	From where?  D.C.?
DR. EDDIE	Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.

ANDERTON	I put you away --
DR. EDDIE	Yes, you did.
ANDERTON	You made those tapes...
DR. EDDIE	They were performance pieces.
ANDERTON	You set your patients on fire!
DR. EDDIE	And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?

ANDERTON	So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
DR. EDDIE	How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.

DR. EDDIE	There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
ANDERTON	How do I find the --
DR. EDDIE	Here --

DR. EDDIE	It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
ANDERTON	I can't even stand up --
DR. EDDIE	I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
ANDERTON	The nano... what?
DR. EDDIE	Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.

DR. EDDIE	I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
ANDERTON	-- go blind.  I know.

ANDERTON	You the sentry?
GIDEON	Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.

GIDEON	I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
ANDERTON	No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
GIDEON	Kill type?
ANDERTON	Drowning.

ANDERTON	Victim's a white female.
GIDEON	This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?

GIDEON	That's an old one.  One of our first.
ANDERTON	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
GIDEON	That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
ANDERTON	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
GIDEON	For that, we have to go for a ride.

ANDERTON	You the only sentry?
GIDEON	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.

GIDEON	Hence the expression...
ANDERTON	... Graveyard shift.
GIDEON	Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".

ANDERTON	Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
GIDEON	On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.

GIDEON	Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
ANDERTON	Try again.
GIDEON	No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.

GIDEON	Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
ANDERTON	Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...

GIDEON	Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
ANDERTON	So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?

GIDEON	You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
ANDERTON	Lara --
GIDEON	It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.

BURGESS	Tell me not to worry, John.
ANDERTON	Don't worry, Lamar.
BURGESS	The nation votes this week...

BURGESS	Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
ANDERTON	Uh-huh...
BURGESS	Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
ANDERTON	Hang on, Lamar --

BURGESS	And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
ANDERTON	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
BURGESS	Don't apologize, John.

BURGESS	You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
ANDERTON	I understand.  Sir.

BURGESS	I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
ANDERTON	Yes, sir.
BURGESS	You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
ANDERTON	I understand.  What's the other thing?
BURGESS	Tuck in your shirt.

BURGESS	And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
ANDERTON	I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.

ANDERTON	Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
BURGESS	So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
ANDERTON	If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
BURGESS	He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.

BURGESS	Lara called me.
ANDERTON	What?
BURGESS	She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
ANDERTON	I'm fine.
BURGESS	I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
ANDERTON	I go running down there.
BURGESS	In the middle of the night?

BURGESS	What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
ANDERTON	I'm fine, Lamar.

BURGESS	You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
ANDERTON	We won't let them.
BURGESS	No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?

ANDERTON	Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
BURGESS	Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
ANDERTON	This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
BURGESS	Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
ANDERTON	Somebody named Leo Crow.
BURGESS	And who the hell is that?
ANDERTON	I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
BURGESS	All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
ANDERTON	I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
BURGESS	Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
ANDERTON	I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
BURGESS	How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
ANDERTON	Can you fake the cerebral output?
BURGESS	We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
ANDERTON	You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
BURGESS	John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

BURGESS	John.  Please.  Listen to me --
ANDERTON	I'm not getting halo'd.
BURGESS	You can't run --
ANDERTON	Everybody runs.

BURGESS	John --
ANDERTON	I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.

BURGESS	People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
ANDERTON	Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!

ANDERTON	No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
BURGESS	No doubt.
ANDERTON	Then go ahead, pull the trigger.

FLETCHER	Seventeen minutes.
ANDERTON	Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.

FLETCHER	Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
ANDERTON	You're kidding, that's today?
FLETCHER	I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
ANDERTON	All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
FLETCHER	Uh, sir...
ANDERTON	Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.

FLETCHER	What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
ANDERTON	The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
FLETCHER	Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
ANDERTON	I show a cop on horseback.

FLETCHER	Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
FLETCHER	You don't have to do this, Chief.
ANDERTON	You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.

ANDERTON	Okay, Jad, what's coming?
JAD	Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.

JAD	We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
ANDERTON	Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

JAD	We can't grab it...
ANDERTON	Run the subscription list...

JAD	Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
ANDERTON	Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
JAD	From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.

JAD	Somewhere near the capital?
ANDERTON	No maglev system.
JAD	The mall?
ANDERTON	Georgetown.

ANDERTON	Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
JAD	Yeah?  So?
ANDERTON	Now look at him...

JAD	Go ahead.
ANDERTON	Did he close the front door?
JAD	What?
ANDERTON	Did Marks close the front door?!

ANDERTON	You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
JAD	Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
ANDERTON	Uh-huh.  Jad?
JAD	Sir?
ANDERTON	Go back to work.  All of you.

ANDERTON	Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
JAD	We're in motion on something.

ANDERTON	Red Ball?
JAD	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
ANDERTON	Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.

JAD	The victim's name is Leo Crow.
ANDERTON	Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
JAD	I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
ANDERTON	Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.

ANDERTON	I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
JAD	That was easy.

ANDERTON	Confirm with trig and image.
JAD	Any ID on the shooter yet?
ANDERTON	Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...

ANDERTON	Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
JAD	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
ANDERTON	Take your time.

ANDERTON	I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
WITWER	Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...

WITWER	As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
ANDERTON	They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
WITWER	You mind if I tag along?

WITWER	But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
ANDERTON	Yes, it is.

ANDERTON	Why did you catch that?
WITWER	Because it was going to fall.
ANDERTON	You're certain?
WITWER	Yes.
ANDERTON	But it didn't fall.  You caught it.

ANDERTON	The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
WITWER	You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
ANDERTON	The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
WITWER	Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?

ANDERTON	It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
WITWER	Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
ANDERTON	To Hineman?

WITWER	To them.
ANDERTON	Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
WITWER	Really?  You've never been inside?
ANDERTON	We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
WITWER	So I'll be the first one to go in then?
ANDERTON	Maybe you didn't hear me.
WITWER	If it's a question of authority.
ANDERTON	There's no question.  You don't have any.
WITWER	I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.

WITWER	I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
ANDERTON	The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
WITWER	But you call this room the "temple".
ANDERTON	Just a nickname.
WITWER	The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.

WITWER	Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
ANDERTON	What does he think of your chosen line of work?
WITWER	I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.

WITWER	At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
ANDERTON	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
WITWER	Flaws.
ANDERTON	There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
WITWER	I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.

ANDERTON	You set me up...
WITWER	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.

WITWER	It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
ANDERTON	You gonna tell on me?
WITWER	Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.

WALLY	I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
ANDERTON	Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.

WALLY	They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
ANDERTON	It helps if you don't think of them as human.

WALLY	Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
ANDERTON	Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
WALLY	She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.

ANDERTON	She was looking right at me.
WALLY	It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.

ANDERTON	She spoke to me.
WALLY	To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
ANDERTON	She said...

ANDERTON	Wally, listen to me...
WALLY	Do I know you?  Who are you?

ANDERTON	I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
WALLY	Oh... Hi, John.

ANDERTON	Are these all of her previsions?
WALLY	There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...

ANDERTON	Just go to the beginning!
WALLY	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?

RUFUS	Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
ANDERTON	I need your help.
RUFUS	Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
ANDERTON	I need help with her.
RUFUS	Well, hello there, honey-pie.

RUFUS	I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
ANDERTON	Rufus.  She's a precog.
RUFUS	She's a precog?
ANDERTON	That's right.

RUFUS	Are you reading my mind right now?
ANDERTON	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
RUFUS	I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!

ANDERTON	She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
RUFUS	No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
ANDERTON	C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
RUFUS	So?
ANDERTON	So now I need you to hack into her.

RUFUS	I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
ANDERTON	They don't belong to anybody.
RUFUS	Then take her to Radio Shack.

ANDERTON	Stop --
RUFUS	Tell me how.

ANDERTON	What happened?  Where's the rest?
RUFUS	I guess that's all of it.

ANDERTON	Rufus, play it back...
RUFUS	Uh, I'll try...

SEAN	I scored a goal!
ANDERTON	That's great.

SEAN	I won!
ANDERTON	What a big boy.  How old are you?

ANDERTON	Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
SEAN	I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.

SEAN	Okay... now let me time you.
ANDERTON	Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
SEAN	Come on!
ANDERTON	All right, I'll try...

ANDERTON	Sean -- you're not real.
SEAN	You gotta have faith, Dad.
ANDERTON	It's a little late for that.
SEAN	Wanna hear something funny?
ANDERTON	What the hell.
SEAN	I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.

ANDERTON	You're alive?
SEAN	No.  He got tired of pretending.
ANDERTON	Oh, Sean --
SEAN	The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
ANDERTON	Sean --
SEAN	I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
ANDERTON	I forgive you.
SEAN	Once I even told him I loved him.
ANDERTON	I forgive you...
SEAN	The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
ANDERTON	I was looking for you...
SEAN	I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
ANDERTON	I wanted to.
SEAN	Good-bye, Dad...

ANDERTON	Who are you?
SEAN	I'm your son.  I'm you.
ANDERTON	Sean, wait...
SEAN	Hold your breath, Dad...

ANDERTON	Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
CROW	Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --

ANDERTON	Do you know who I am?
CROW	Some -- somebody's father?
ANDERTON	His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.

CROW	... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
ANDERTON	He's alive?

ANDERTON	Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
CROW	I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.

CROW	It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
ANDERTON	NO!

CROW	You're not gonna kill me?
ANDERTON	No.

CROW	But you have to.  They said you would.
ANDERTON	The precogs were wrong.
CROW	If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!

CROW	You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
ANDERTON	Who said I would?

CROW	Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
ANDERTON	Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
CROW	Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
ANDERTON	I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
CROW	I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
ANDERTON	What the fuck is going on?

ANDERTON	What about the picture --
CROW	Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
ANDERTON	Tell me, who was it, set this up?
CROW	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
ANDERTON	Who made you do this?
CROW	Kill me!
ANDERTON	Tell me!

ANDERTON	Let go of the gun.
CROW	You're not gonna kill me...
ANDERTON	Good-bye, Crow.

IRIS	Something wrong?
ANDERTON	I'm a little dizzy...

IRIS	Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
ANDERTON	The what?
IRIS	The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...

IRIS	You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
ANDERTON	I'm... not... a... killer.

IRIS	Just what is it you think I can do for you?
ANDERTON	You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
IRIS	And how would I know that?

ANDERTON	What's so funny?
IRIS	If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
ANDERTON	You don't seem all that proud.
IRIS	I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
ANDERTON	Heal who?
IRIS	The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
ANDERTON	You're talking about the precogs...
IRIS	You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.

IRIS	It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
ANDERTON	And how did Lamar become involved?
IRIS	Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
ANDERTON	You say some of the children died?
IRIS	So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
ANDERTON	I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
IRIS	And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
ANDERTON	Not if I stay away from him.
IRIS	How can you avoid a man you've never met?
ANDERTON	So you won't help me?
IRIS	I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.

ANDERTON	What?
IRIS	Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
ANDERTON	Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
IRIS	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
ANDERTON	Why?
IRIS	Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

ANDERTON	You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
IRIS	I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
ANDERTON	Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
IRIS	I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
ANDERTON	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
IRIS	Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
ANDERTON	Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
IRIS	The system would collapse.
ANDERTON	I believe in that system...
IRIS	Do you?  Really?

ANDERTON	You want to bring it down.
IRIS	But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
ANDERTON	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
IRIS	Hold that thought.
ANDERTON	Why should I trust you?
IRIS	You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
ANDERTON	You said they're destroyed.
IRIS	I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
ANDERTON	What safe place is that?
IRIS	The safest place of all.

ANDERTON	Where?
IRIS	Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
ANDERTON	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
IRIS	If... you have one.
ANDERTON	-- and then walk out.
IRIS	Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
ANDERTON	You're insane or you think I am.

ANDERTON	I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
IRIS	Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.

ANDERTON	How do I even know which one has it?
IRIS	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
ANDERTON	Which one is that?
IRIS	The female.

LARA	John?
ANDERTON'S VOICE	He's dead, Lara.
LARA	Oh, God, what did you do?
ANDERTON'S VOICE	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
LARA	Then how did he --
ANDERTON'S VOICE	Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?

BURGESS	This is all my fault.
LARA	No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.

BURGESS	I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
LARA	You look great.

BURGESS	It's insanity around here.
LARA	I thought you were retiring?
BURGESS	I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.

BURGESS	Who?
LARA	Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
BURGESS	I don't know who that is.

LARA	John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
BURGESS	We know why John was tagged.
LARA	He also said Crow was a fake.

LARA	Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
BURGESS	Sean --
LARA	No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.

BURGESS	I understand.
LARA	No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.

BURGESS	But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
LARA	Lamar --
BURGESS	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
LARA	Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.

SECRETARY	The guy from USA Today is here.
BURGESS	Tell him not now.
SECRETARY	He just wanted a few minutes before --
BURGESS	Not.  Now.

SECRETARY	Sir, the press conference is starting.
BURGESS	I'll be right there.

SECRETARY	Congratulations, sir.
BURGESS	My God...

BURGESS	How did you get this?
SECRETARY	I padded your expense account for the last six months.

SECRETARY	You have an emergency call on your private line.
BURGESS	Thank you.  This is Burgess.

WITWER	He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
BURGESS	The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
WITWER	Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
BURGESS	The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
WITWER	Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
BURGESS	None of your damn business.
WITWER	Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
BURGESS	He's my subordinate!

WITWER	Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
BURGESS	I don't want John Anderton hurt.

WITWER	Lamar, I found something.
BURGESS	What?
WITWER	I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
BURGESS	Where are you?

BURGESS	Good God.  What was that?
WITWER	Wait, just a second...

BURGESS	He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
WITWER	Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...

BURGESS	It's the same prevision.
WITWER	Not quite.

WITWER	Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
BURGESS	I don't understand --
WITWER	This murder is happening at two different times.

WITWER	According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
BURGESS	I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
WITWER	I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
BURGESS	Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
WITWER	I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
BURGESS	How?

WITWER	By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
BURGESS	Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
WITWER	Precog Deja Vu...
BURGESS	We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...

WITWER	So there is a way to fool the system?
BURGESS	Yes.

WITWER	Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
BURGESS	Shhh.  You know what I hear?
WITWER	What?
BURGESS	Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.

RUFUS	Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
CUSTOMER	I wanna kill my boss.
RUFUS	Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
CUSTOMER	Right here.
RUFUS	Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --

RUFUS	Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
CUSTOMER	No, I wanna kill my boss!
RUFUS	Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.

FLETCHER	This is Evanna, the team pilot.
WITWER	Nice to meet you.  Gum?

WITWER	So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
FLETCHER	Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.

WITWER	Can't they shut that off?
FLETCHER	That's the Red Ball Alarm.

FLETCHER	Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
WITWER	People have gotten the message.  Gum?

FLETCHER	The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
WITWER	I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.

FLETCHER	Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
WITWER	Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.

FLETCHER	Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
WITWER	Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
FLETCHER	What?!

FLETCHER	Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
WITWER	Yes, I know.

FLETCHER	Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
WITWER	There's thousands of units like this one.
FLETCHER	They're everywhere.

WITWER	Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
FLETCHER	No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
WITWER	Because he thinks he's innocent.

WITWER	There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
FLETCHER	Two?

WITWER	It doesn't matter.  He wins.
FLETCHER	We can stop him.
WITWER	She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.

WITWER	He's trying to prove his innocence.
FLETCHER	He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
WITWER	No.  He can't...

WITWER	There a maid in this hotel?
FLETCHER	I don't know, why?
WITWER	If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
FLETCHER	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
WITWER	What kind of cop were you before this?
FLETCHER	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
WITWER	Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.

WITWER	I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
FLETCHER	How many?
WITWER	None.  This was arranged.

KNOTT	That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
FLETCHER	I think you're swell company, Knott.
KNOTT	It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...

KNOTT	People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
FLETCHER	Knott!

FLETCHER	Why don't I feel like celebrating?
KNOTT	Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.

FLETCHER	John Anderton was my friend!
KNOTT	You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...

HOWARD	He looks familiar.
SARAH	Who?
HOWARD	The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
SARAH	How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.

SARAH	What about your meeting?
HOWARD	I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.

HOWARD	We could have lunch together.
SARAH	I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
HOWARD	Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.

SARAH	Raincheck?
HOWARD	Sure.  Raincheck.

SARAH	Howard --
HOWARD	I forgot my glasses.

WITWER	My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
LARA	I know who you are.

WITWER	This your work?
LARA	Yes.

WITWER	I like it.
LARA	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
WITWER	Cream and sugar.
LARA	I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
WITWER	Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
LARA	We used to, every summer.
WITWER	He's not here now, is he?

LARA	I don't have any sugar either.
WITWER	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
LARA	No.
WITWER	You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
LARA	No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
WITWER	So you haven't seen his apartment?
LARA	That was our apartment.
WITWER	Have you been there recently?

LARA	Since right after we lost our son.
WITWER	You mean after he lost your son.
LARA	It was nobody's fault.
WITWER	But John was with him at the pool?
LARA	Yes.

WITWER	You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
LARA	It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
WITWER	What was it then?
LARA	The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
WITWER	He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
LARA	He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
WITWER	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...

WITWER	Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
LARA	I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.

WITWER	You know I need to use you.
LARA	To what?  Trap him?
WITWER	To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
LARA	I haven't seen him in two years.
WITWER	But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.

WITWER	Nice to meet you, Wally.
WALLY	Shhh!  They're sleeping.
WITWER	Tell me how all this works.

WALLY	They've never been separated before.
WITWER	What does he want with a precog?
WALLY	What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
WITWER	But there's still the other two.

WITWER	Wally, the other two can still function, right?
WALLY	You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
WITWER	Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
WALLY	Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
WITWER	Jesus...

CREASY	What am I doing here?
MANZANO	Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
CREASY	No.

MANZANO	You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
CREASY	Am I a suspect?
MANZANO	No. It would be convenient, but no.

CREASY	Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
MANZANO	All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.

MANZANO	Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
CREASY	It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
MANZANO	Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.

MANZANO	The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
CREASY	What do you want?
MANZANO	The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
CREASY	I don't know shit about you.
MANZANO	He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.

MANZANO	My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
CREASY	It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
MANZANO	It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
CREASY	Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?

MANZANO	My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
CREASY	So you are going to talk me to death.
MANZANO	You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
CREASY	Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
MANZANO	I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
CREASY	My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
MANZANO	No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
CREASY	Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
MANZANO	You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
CREASY	I'm not... easy.

MANZANO	Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
CREASY	Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.

CUSTOMS	[Where are you coming from?]
CREASY	[South America.]
CUSTOMS	[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
CREASY	[I'm on to Juarez.]
CUSTOMS	[Why?]
CREASY	[I have a friend there.]

CUSTOMS	[Senor?]
CREASY	[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]

ROSANNA	A lot of people are looking for you.
CREASY	I guess that makes you the smart one.
ROSANNA	We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.

ROSANNA	It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
CREASY	It's a little late.

CREASY	Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
ROSANNA	So where do we begin?
CREASY	I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
ROSANNA	So what do I get in return?
CREASY	Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.

CREASY	I need something. Do you have banking connections?
ROSANNA	I have connections.

ROSANNA	Where do I find you?
CREASY	I'll call you tomorrow.

CREASY	What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
ROSANNA	He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
CREASY	Where does he live?
ROSANNA	He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
CREASY	Give me the address.

CREASY	Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
ROSANNA	How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
CREASY	You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.

ROSANNA	I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
CREASY	I show, you give me the information?
ROSANNA	Deal.
CREASY	Where?

CREASY	[Reina Rosas.]
REINA	[Si.]
CREASY	[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]

REINA	[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
CREASY	[What is his name?]
REINA	[Daniel.]
CREASY	[Daniel what?]

REINA	[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
CREASY	[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]

CREASY	[What is his name?]
REINA	[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]

CREASY	[How does it work?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]

CREASY	[Who pays you?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]

CREASY	[What's the PIN number?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[The what?]
CREASY	[The number you use at the bank machine.]
GUARDIAN TWO	[Four-seven-four-seven.]
CREASY	[Who killed her? You?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[No!]
CREASY	[Don't lie to me.]
GUARDIAN TWO	[The boss did or his brother.]
CREASY	[Who's the boss?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]

CREASY	[What money?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
CREASY	[Who's Tazinari?]
GUARDIAN TWO	[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]

SISTER ANNA	[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
CREASY	[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
SISTER ANNA	[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
CREASY	[So am I, Sister.]
SISTER ANNA	[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
CREASY	[Not for a long time, sister.]
SISTER ANNA	[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
CREASY	[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]

CREASY	[Drive.]
JORGE	[Do you know who I am?]
CREASY	[You are Jorge Ramirez.]

JORGE	[Do you know who I am?]
CREASY	[Who are you?]
JORGE	[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]

CREASY	[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
JORGE	[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
CREASY	[Ordered by who?]

JORGE	[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
CREASY	[Who ordered it?]
JORGE	[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
CREASY	[Where do I find him?]
JORGE	[I don't know. No one knows.]

JORGE	[I don't know, I swear.]
CREASY	[I believe you.]
JORGE	[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
CREASY	[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
JORGE	[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
CREASY	[Who's he?]
JORGE	[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]

CREASY	Who's he?
JORGE	I don't know, but I know his face.

JORGE	[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
CREASY	[How do I recognize him.]
JORGE	[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
CREASY	[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
JORGE	[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]

CREASY	[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
DANIEL	[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
CREASY	[I want you.]

DANIEL	[How much do you want?]
CREASY	[It's non-negotiable.]
DANIEL	[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
CREASY	[I told you, non-negotiable.]

DANIEL	[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
CREASY	[I want you.]
DANIEL	[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
CREASY	[Your brother wants to talk to you.]

CREASY	[Yeah.  Yes.]
DANIEL	[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
CREASY	[What do you mean?]
DANIEL	[Her life for your life.]

DANIEL	[The girl's. Pinta's.]
CREASY	[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
DANIEL	[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]

TAZINARI	[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
CREASY	[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
TAZINARI	[Correct!]

TAZINARI	[Please, don't...]
CREASY	[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]

TAZINARI	[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
CREASY	[Lucky how?]
TAZINARI	[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
CREASY	[And?]
TAZINARI	[And I had my men ready.]
CREASY	[You stole the drop.]

TAZINARI	[Yes. Many times.]
CREASY	[O.K. So tell me more.]
TAZINARI	[There was no ten million dollars.]
CREASY	[The ransom was ten.]
TAZINARI	[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
CREASY	[Don't lie to me!]
TAZINARI	[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]

CREASY	[Maybe your men stole from you.]
TAZINARI	[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
CREASY	[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
TAZINARI	[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]

TAZINARI	[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
CREASY	[That's what everybody keeps saying.]

SAMUEL	Were you provided with a gun?
CREASY	Yes.
SAMUEL	Show me, please.

SAMUEL	What is it?
CREASY	Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
SAMUEL	Have you used this type before?

SAMUEL	Is it loaded?
CREASY	It's loaded.

SAMUEL	Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
CREASY	I drink.
SAMUEL	How does it affect you?
CREASY	My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
SAMUEL	And what if amateurs try it?
CREASY	I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
SAMUEL	No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.

CREASY	When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
RAYBURN	Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
CREASY	I'm here.
RAYBURN	What do you mean, I'm here?
CREASY	I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

RAYBURN	You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
CREASY	Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
RAYBURN	Everything happens once if you live long enough.
CREASY	It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
RAYBURN	This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.

RAYBURN	So what's wrong?
CREASY	Nothing wrong.
RAYBURN	Don't give me that bullshit.

CREASY	So how's business?
RAYBURN	Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
CREASY	But don't you stay in El Paso?
RAYBURN	Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

CREASY	Yeah, right...
RAYBURN	Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
CREASY	And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.

RAYBURN	You been working?
CREASY	Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
RAYBURN	How long you staying, Crease?
CREASY	Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.

RAYBURN	You did something on impulse?
CREASY	Everything happens once if you live long enough.

RAYBURN	Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
CREASY	You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
RAYBURN	Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
CREASY	And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
RAYBURN	You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.

RAYBURN	It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
CREASY	A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
RAYBURN	So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.

RAYBURN	What are you doing here?
CREASY	I came to visit you.
RAYBURN	Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
CREASY	A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
RAYBURN	Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
CREASY	Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
RAYBURN	Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.

CREASY	There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
RAYBURN	You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?

RAYBURN	You mean a misfire?
CREASY	I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
RAYBURN	I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
CREASY	Maybe...

RAYBURN	Creasy?
CREASY	Sorry I woke you, Ray.

CREASY	Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
RAYBURN	I said the plan was right here.

RAYBURN	You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
CREASY	Pinta...
RAYBURN	Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.

CREASY	Stomach's gone. But... okay.
RAYBURN	I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.

RAYBURN	Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
CREASY	Yes or no?
RAYBURN	I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.

CREASY	I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
RAYBURN	I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.

CREASY	Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
RAYBURN	Different door. Not far from here.

PINTA	Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY	If they like me.
PINTA	Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
CREASY	Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
PINTA	Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.

PINTA	That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
CREASY	Who's Emilio?
PINTA	My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.

PINTA	In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY	Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
PINTA	Creasy...

PINTA	Where are you from, Creasy?
CREASY	The United States.
PINTA	I know. But which state?

CREASY	No.
PINTA	You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
CREASY	No.
PINTA	Why not?
CREASY	I'm looking for potential.

PINTA	Potential? I don't understand.
CREASY	Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
PINTA	Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
CREASY	Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
PINTA	Someone gave him more money than we could.
CREASY	I'm a bargain.
PINTA	Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
CREASY	Time will tell.
PINTA	There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY	Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.

PINTA	We're taking a different way home.
CREASY	That's right.

PINTA	Did you like school, Creasy?
CREASY	No.
PINTA	Not at all?
CREASY	No.
PINTA	But why not?

PINTA	Hmmm?
CREASY	It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
PINTA	So you were unhappy?
CREASY	Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
PINTA	Oh...

CREASY	And don't start crying.
PINTA	I'm not crying.

CREASY	Pinta, do you have a pencil?
PINTA	I go to school, don't I?

CREASY	You're fast.
PINTA	Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.

CREASY	What are you doing?
PINTA	Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
CREASY	Do you think he'll come back?
PINTA	Maybe. Did you hear him?
CREASY	No.
PINTA	How do you think he got out?
CREASY	Well, I let him go.
PINTA	It's better to be free, right?
CREASY	Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.

CREASY	They'll be back in a week.
PINTA	They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.

PINTA	It hurts.
CREASY	Where?
PINTA	Everywhere!

CREASY	I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
PINTA	My ankle.

PINTA	The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
CREASY	White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.

CREASY	Do you always sleep with him?
PINTA	I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
CREASY	I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?

CREASY	Did you sleep alright?
PINTA	Yes.
CREASY	How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
PINTA	It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
CREASY	In a week you should be fine.

PINTA	Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
CREASY	You need to practice.

CREASY	Why do you ask?
PINTA	It was in a book at school. Concubine.

CREASY	Well, it's a sort of wife.
PINTA	But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
CREASY	In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
PINTA	It must be difficult having lots of wives.
CREASY	You feel sorry for the husband?
PINTA	[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]

PINTA	So how come you know so much about those countries?
CREASY	I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
PINTA	What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
CREASY	No, that was in Columbia.

CREASY	You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
PINTA	I don't understand.
CREASY	Don't worry. You will.

CREASY	Remember you asked me what state I was from?
PINTA	Yes.
CREASY	Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
PINTA	Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
CREASY	I guess that really does make me a hard case.

PINTA	Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
CREASY	No.
PINTA	Did you used to?
CREASY	Yeah. Two or three.

PINTA	You're late.
CREASY	I'm sorry.
PINTA	You were never late before, I was worried.

PINTA	Where's my mother?
CREASY	I dropped her at home.
PINTA	It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?

PINTA	I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
CREASY	I know you're not.
PINTA	Are you afraid of me?

CREASY	The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
PINTA	The gunshot holds no fear.
CREASY	You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.

PINTA	I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
CREASY	There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.

PINTA	What's so important in Los Angeles?
CREASY	Your father has business.
PINTA	Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?

CREASY	The blocks.
PINTA	I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.

PINTA	Could I ask you a question?
CREASY	Could I stop you?
PINTA	You don't drink like you used to.
CREASY	That's not a question.
PINTA	I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
CREASY	Still not a question.
PINTA	My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
CREASY	Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
PINTA	You think too much?
CREASY	Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.

CREASY	Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
PINTA	Frank. Frankie.

CREASY	That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
PINTA	You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
CREASY	Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
PINTA	There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
CREASY	Then be trained.
PINTA	I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
CREASY	Be a swimmer.
PINTA	I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.

CREASY	Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
PINTA	Dyslexic?
CREASY	Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
PINTA	You got that right.
CREASY	You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.

LISA	The world of our children. How dare they?
CREASY	It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
LISA	You're American.
CREASY	So are you.

LISA	You've done much of this work before?
CREASY	Never.

LISA	Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
CREASY	I'm fine.
LISA	Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
CREASY	The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
LISA	It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?

LISA	How are you getting along with Pinta?
CREASY	We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
LISA	Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY	No.
LISA	You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
CREASY	You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?

CREASY	Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
LISA	No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.

LISA	It makes it all seem so serious.
CREASY	It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
LISA	Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.

CREASY	Sorry.
LISA	The traffic takes some getting used to.

LISA	Jordan!
CREASY	If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.

LISA	Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
CREASY	Because...  I was already dead.

CREASY	They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
LISA	Planned what?
CREASY	An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.

LISA	I don't believe you.
CREASY	I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
LISA	You're lying. I don't believe you.
CREASY	Then don't come.

LISA	Creasy... Wait.
CREASY	Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

ROSANNA	Rosanna Guerrero.
CREASY'S VOICE	It's Creasy.
ROSANNA	Where are you?
CREASY'S VOICE	Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
ROSANNA	Last night. Do you know something?
CREASY'S VOICE	What was her name?
ROSANNA	Camila. Camila Valencias.

JORDAN	The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
SAMUEL	And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
JORDAN	If she pisses you off, you get another one.
SAMUEL	Do you know what she told me last night?

SAMUEL	Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
JORDAN	Yeah? And if she was ugly?

JORDAN	All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
SAMUEL	I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
JORDAN	I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
SAMUEL	I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!

JORDAN	You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
SAMUEL	For a year?
JORDAN	For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.

SAMUEL	And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
JORDAN	Her beauty fucks with your mind.
SAMUEL	For an American she understands this country very well.
JORDAN	She understands men.

VOICE	[You have the money.]
JORDAN	[Yes.]
VOICE	[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
JORDAN	[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
VOICE	[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]

JORDAN	[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
VOICE	[No. Why?]
JORDAN	[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
VOICE	[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]

LISA	You should be sleeping, baby.
PINTA	I'm trying, mom.

LISA	Good news. You're going back to school.
PINTA	When?
LISA	Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.

PINTA	Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
LISA	We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.

PINTA	Yes, mom?
LISA	This is Mr. Creasy.

PINTA	I like him, Mom.
LISA	You do?
PINTA	He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...

PINTA	I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
LISA	Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.

PINTA	Bye, Mom.
LISA	Don't forget your towel.

LISA	I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
PINTA	You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.

LISA	A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
SAMUEL	And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
LISA	I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
SAMUEL	Our daughter.

LISA	Our child's safety is at stake.
SAMUEL	These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
LISA	Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.

SAMUEL	My wife, Mr. Creasy.
LISA	Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

SAMUEL	He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
LISA	Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

LISA	I think it's nice he's American.
SAMUEL	I think it's fantastic.
LISA	You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.

LISA	She likes him.
SAMUEL	Hmm?
LISA	Creasy. Pinta likes him.
SAMUEL	Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.

LISA	He has to go, Samuel.
SAMUEL	What? Who?
LISA	Creasy.
SAMUEL	Why? You were so pleased with him.
LISA	Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
SAMUEL	That's ridiculous.
LISA	It's not.

SAMUEL	I've just been so busy, Lisa.
LISA	He has to go.

SAMUEL	It will be a hard break.
LISA	She's young. She'll get over it.
SAMUEL	I wasn't thinking of Pinta.

ROSANNA	[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
MANZANO	[Is that good or bad?]
ROSANNA	[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]

MANZANO	[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
ROSANNA	[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]

ROSANNA	[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
MANZANO	[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]

MANZANO	[I know this. Your point?]
ROSANNA	[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]

ROSANNA	[Then what do you have to lose?]
MANZANO	[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]

MANZANO	[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
ROSANNA	[And left three more dead men.]

MANZANO	[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
ROSANNA	[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
MANZANO	[I think he's... magnificent.]

MANZANO	[You only fuck me to get information.]
ROSANNA	[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
MANZANO	[A beautiful circle.]

ROSANNA	[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
MANZANO	[I should start going for your tits first.]

ROSANNA	[Who's that?]
MANZANO	[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]

RAYBURN	He's not a cop killer.
MANZANO	I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
RAYBURN	He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
MANZANO	So am I.

MANZANO	Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
RAYBURN	I already ate.

MANZANO	Tell me about your friend Creasy.
RAYBURN	You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
MANZANO	I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
RAYBURN	Two tourists who never went home.
MANZANO	You helped him get this job.
RAYBURN	That's what friends do.
MANZANO	Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
RAYBURN	I can take care of myself.
MANZANO	You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
RAYBURN	The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
MANZANO	What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?

RAYBURN	None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
MANZANO	This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
RAYBURN	He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
MANZANO	I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
RAYBURN	Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
MANZANO	What was she to Creasy then?
RAYBURN	Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
MANZANO	And they took that away.
RAYBURN	A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.

ADAM	We've got him locked!
BILLY	Speed?

ADAM	He's on us!!
BILLY	Wait a second...  What time is it?

BILLY	It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
ADAM	Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
BILLY	We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--

ADAM	WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
BILLY	IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!

AISHA	Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
ALPHA 5	... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.

ALPHA 5	It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
AISHA	If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!

ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
AISHA	How can we reach Phaedos?

ALPHA 5	Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
AISHA	What?!
ALPHA 5	Zordon...  he's gone.

AISHA	Is this... food!
DULCEA	They're called squirbs.

AISHA	So how can we get to it?
DULCEA	The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

DULCEA	He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
AISHA	Ah... sure.

DULCEA	In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
AISHA	Yeah, right.
DULCEA	It will not harm you.

AISHA	Wow.  Sand.
DULCEA	Now tell me... what do you see?

DULCEA	Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
AISHA	Stylin'!

AISHA	I heard that!
BILLY	I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.

AISHA	... What's happening to him?'
BILLY	Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!

BILLY	I can hardly walk...
AISHA	I've never been this sore in my life.

AISHA	We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
BILLY	There should be a way to open it.

AISHA	Release the power with the power.
BILLY	I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!

BILLY	SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
AISHA	OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!

AISHA	Anybody see anything?
TOMMY	... Let's take a look over there.

AISHA	SABER TOOTH TIGER!
TOMMY	WHITE TIGER!

TOMMY	Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
AISHA	Activating Power Beam!

AISHA	That's pretty bad.
TOMMY	Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.

TOMMY	Release the power WITH the power.
AISHA	What does that mean?!

AISHA	1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
TOMMY	Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!

ALPHA 5	In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
ZORDON	The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
ALPHA 5	To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
ZORDON	Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.

ZORDON	Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
ALPHA 5	Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!

ZORDON	... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
ALPHA 5	I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
ZORDON	... We must try to communicate with them.

ALPHA 5	By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
ZORDON	... I just pray we're not too late.

ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
ZORDON	Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

DULCEA	It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
BILLY	Where did it originate?
DULCEA	In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.

BILLY	I see... a fox
DULCEA	Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.

DULCEA	It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
BILLY	What's a Triac?
DULCEA	About twenty seconds in your time.

KIMBERLY	PTERODACTYL!
BILLY	TRICERATOPS!

KIMBERLY	You okay?
BILLY	I think so.

BILLY	I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
KIMBERLY	I am the crane, agile and sublime!

BILLY	Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
KIMBERLY	WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!

KIMBERLY	NINJA CRANE ZORD!
BILLY	NINJA WOLF ZORD!

BILLY	All systems go!
KIMBERLY	This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!

BILLY	That's the only way to the Monolith...
ROCKY	We can take these guys!

BILLY	... Nothing.
ROCKY	Release the power with the power.

ROCKY	NEW POWER COINS!!
BILLY	OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!

ROCKY	Two thirty three a.m.
BILLY	Ryan's Comet!!

BILLY	THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
ROCKY	GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

BILLY	009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
ROCKY	THERE'S THE COMET!

BILLY	... Not bad.
TOMMY	Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.

BILLY	Let's go after him!!
TOMMY	Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!

TOMMY	I'm in!
BILLY	LET'S FLY!

BILLY	IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
TOMMY	WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!

BILLY	FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
TOMMY	WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

BULK	The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
SKULL	Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

BULK	Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
SKULL	Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...

BULK	The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
SKULL	We could smell it's breath.

SKULL	Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
BULK	A stellar idea, Skull.

BULK	Here you go!  No pushing!
SKULL	There's enough for everybody!

SKULL	Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
BULK	If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.

BULK	There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL	A real shame.

BULK	SKULL!!
SKULL	BULK!!

TOMMY	And how do we do that?
DULCEA	By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.

TOMMY	It's... an eagle?
DULCEA	Look closer.
TOMMY	... A falcon?
DULCEA	Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.

TOMMY	And how do we release the power?
DULCEA	The legend goes that you release the power with the power.

GOLDAR	We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
MORDANT	Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...

GOLDAR	Hey, boss!
MORDANT	What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky

MORDANT	As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
GOLDAR	How about Major Moron?

MORDANT	Just shut your gap!
GOLDAR	Did I say anything?

GOLDAR	I'm outta here.
MORDANT	Wait for me!

GOLDAR	GET OFF ME!
MORDANT	BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GOLDAR	SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!

IVAN	Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
GOLDAR	You want me to place a few calls?

GOLDAR	No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
IVAN	Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

GOLDAR	But boss, what about their parents?
IVAN	Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.

IVAN	Simon says...
GOLDAR	Quack like a'duck!

IVAN	What!
GOLDAR	You forgot to say 'Simon says."

IVAN	THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
GOLDAR	GO IVAN!!

IVAN	Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
MORDANT	You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--

MORDANT	That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
IVAN	So they've been destroyed?

MORDANT	Basically.
IVAN	What do you mean "basically"?
MORDANT	Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!

IVAN	Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
MORDANT	How'd you know?
IVAN	Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

MORDANT	What is THAT!
IVAN	Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD

ZEDD	Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
RITA	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!

RITA	Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
ZEDD	How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!

ZEDD	Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
RITA	From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!

RITA	I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
ZEDD	GO POWER RANGERS!

ZEDD	That was a CHEAP shot!
RITA	We couldn't have done it better ourselves.

TOMMY	Anybody see them?
ROCKY	Activating Power Scope!

TOMMY	How the heck?!...
ROCKY	What's going on?!

TOMMY	Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
ROCKY	Strength in numbers!!

ROCKY	I am the mighty ape!
TOMMY	And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!

ROCKY	THREE SECONDS!!
TOMMY	LET'S DO IT!?

ROCKY	NINJA APE ZORD!
TOMMY	NINJA FALCON ZORD!

BONES	But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
SPOCK	It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
BONES	It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
SPOCK	I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
BONES	Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
SPOCK	I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
BONES	Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?

BONES	Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
SPOCK	But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
BONES	You're not going in there -- !
SPOCK	I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --

KIRK	Physician, heal thyself.
BONES	That's all you have to say?
KIRK	I'm not a drama critic.

BONES	Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
KIRK	They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.

KIRK	Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
BONES	'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...

KIRK	Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
BONES	I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
KIRK	Twenty-two, eighty-three...
BONES	Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.

KIRK	I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
BONES	More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!

KIRK	Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
BONES	Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
KIRK	Uh -- what are they?
BONES	For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
KIRK	But I'm allergic to Retlax.
BONES	Exactly. Happy birthday.

BONES	Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
KIRK	Amazing! I don't know what to say --
BONES	Say thank you.
KIRK	Thank you.

BONES	Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
KIRK	Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
BONES	What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
KIRK	Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
BONES	Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
KIRK	And who am I hiding from?
BONES	From yourself, Admiral.

KIRK	Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
BONES	I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.

BONES	Shore leave, Admiral.
KIRK	Ah.

BONES	What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
KIRK	The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.

BONES	It never rains but when it pours --
KIRK	As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.

BONES	I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
KIRK	Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.

BONES	Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
KIRK	At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
BONES	There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
KIRK	I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.

BONES	Khan could be down there!
KIRK	He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
BONES	I can spare me...

KIRK	They even killed the galley chief.
BONES	This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.

BONES	Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
KIRK	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.

BONES	But what if they went -- nowhere?
KIRK	Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.

KIRK	Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
BONES	How can you think of food at a time like this?
KIRK	Our first order of business is survival.

KIRK	Now that's what I call a meal.
BONES	It's like the Garden of Eden...

BONES	Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
KIRK	And almost got tossed out of the Academy...

BONES	Until now.
KIRK	We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.

KIRK	Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
BONES	I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

BONES	You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
KIRK	Young. I feel young, Doctor.

CHEKOV	... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
CAROL	Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
CHEKOV	Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
CAROL	En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
CHEKOV	All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

CAROL	I still don't under --
CHEKOV	We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.

CAROL	<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
CHEKOV	The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
CAROL	But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
CHEKOV	I have my orders.

CAROL	This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
CHEKOV	I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

CAROL	Jim... read me? Can you read me?
KIRK	Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
CAROL	... Can't read you... repeat...
KIRK	Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
CAROL	... taking Genesis away from us...
KIRK	Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
CAROL	... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
KIRK	What order? Who's taking Genesis?
CAROL	... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
KIRK	Carol!
CAROL	Jim please --

KIRK	Wait --
CAROL	Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.

CAROL	David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
KIRK	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
CAROL	How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.

KIRK	You did this -- in a day?!
CAROL	The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?

KIRK	It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
CAROL	Is that a poem?
KIRK	Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.

DAVID	How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
CAROL	And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
DAVID	Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
CAROL	I know, I know...

DAVID	Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
CAROL	Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
DAVID	Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
CAROL	Maybe...
DAVID	Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --

DAVID	Does that about do it?
CAROL	I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
DAVID	Who --

CAROL	Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
DAVID	Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.

DAVID	I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
CAROL	Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.

CAROL	David --
DAVID	Mother, go back!

CAROL	Jim --
DAVID	Go back. I'm going to kill him.
CAROL	You do that and you'll have murdered your father.

DAVID	So are we, it looks like.
CAROL	I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?

CAROL	This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
DAVID	But we can't just sit here -- !

CAROL	David. Please.
DAVID	This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.

TERRELL	Don't tell me you've got something.
CHEKOV	We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
TERRELL	Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
CHEKOV	I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
TERRELL	All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
CHEKOV	You know what she'll say...

TERRELL	Are you sure these are the coordinates?
CHEKOV	Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
TERRELL	I can hardly see --

TERRELL	You're crazy -- !
CHEKOV	I saw it -- !
TERRELL	There's an air-lock.

CHEKOV	I told you! I told you I saw a --
TERRELL	Ssssh!

CHEKOV	<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
TERRELL	What's the matter -- ?

TERRELL	But the child --
CHEKOV	Never mind! Hurry!

CHEKOV	A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
TERRELL	What do you want with us? I demand --

CHEKOV	He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
TERRELL	Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...

CHEKOV	You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
KHAN	<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
CHEKOV	Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
KHAN	And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!

CHEKOV	Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
KHAN	There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.

CHEKOV	Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
KHAN	Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
CHEKOV	I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
KHAN	Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
CHEKOV	To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
KHAN	I see. Helmsman?

KHAN	Well done, Commander.
CHEKOV	You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.

KIRK	I'm Admiral Kirk...
DAVID	<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --

KIRK	Where's Dr. Marcus --
DAVID	I'm Doctor Marcus!

KIRK	Why didn't you tell me?
DAVID	She's making it up! My father was Professor --

KIRK	It's a long story.
DAVID	We appear to have plenty of time.

DAVID	It's the Genesis Wave!
KIRK	What?
DAVID	He's on a build up to detonation!
KIRK	How soon --
DAVID	We encoded four minutes --
KIRK	We'll beam aboard and stop it --
DAVID	You can't!

DAVID	I don't mean to intrude.
KIRK	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
DAVID	Are you running away from me?

KIRK	I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
DAVID	No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
KIRK	I didn't expect anything.
DAVID	That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
KIRK	Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
DAVID	You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
KIRK	It was just words.
DAVID	But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
KIRK	I'm trying, David.
DAVID	So am I. My friends were killed, too.
KIRK	I am truly sorry.

DAVID	I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
KIRK	Is that what you came here to say?
DAVID	Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.

DAVID	Let go -- he can't -- !
SAAVIK	Only half of you would get there.

DAVID	What are you looking at?
SAAVIK	The Admiral's son.
DAVID	Don't you believe it.
SAAVIK	Oh, I believe it.

SAAVIK	What are <u>you</u> looking at?
DAVID	I don't know.

JOACHIM	Steady on course. All systems normal.
KHAN	It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?

JOACHIM	They're requesting visual communications, sir.
KHAN	Let them eat static.
JOACHIM	They're still running with shields down.
KHAN	Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.

KHAN	Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
JOACHIM	Locking phasers on target.

JOACHIM	Sir -- our shields are dropping!
KHAN	Raise them --

JOACHIM	They won't --
KHAN	<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??

KHAN	At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
JOACHIM	We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
KHAN	No!
JOACHIM	Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.

KHAN	Well?
JOACHIM	Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.

JOACHIM	Departing dark side, Regula.
KHAN	Visual --

JOACHIM	We'll lose them if they go in there.
KHAN	Rake her.

JOACHIM	No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
KHAN	<u>Full power damn you</u>!

KHAN	Tactical!
JOACHIM	Inoperative.
KHAN	Raise the shields...

JOACHIM	Yours... is... the superior...
KHAN	I shall avenge you --

KHAN	You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
KIRK	What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
KHAN	Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --

KHAN	-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
KIRK	Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
KHAN	That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.

KIRK	Genesis, what's that?
KHAN	Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
KIRK	Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
KHAN	I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

KHAN	Thirty seconds...
KIRK	... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...

KIRK	Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
KHAN	I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
KIRK	I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.

KHAN	Time's up, Admiral...
KIRK	Here it comes. Now, Spock.

KHAN	Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
KIRK	Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
KHAN	Perhaps I no longer need to try.

KHAN	Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
KIRK	KHAN!

KHAN	I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
TERRELL	Chekov, who is this man?

KHAN	You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
TERRELL	Listen to me -- you men and women --
KHAN	Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
TERRELL	I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
KHAN	Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?

KHAN	Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
TERRELL	All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
KHAN	First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.

KIRK	An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir.
KIRK	We'll be going to warp speed --
SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir --

KIRK	Scotty -- what's left?
SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
KIRK	We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
SCOTTY'S VOICE	A few shots, sir.

SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just barely, sir.
KIRK	I'm going down to the station.

SCOTTY'S VOICE	I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
KIRK	Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.

KIRK	Uhura. Can't you augment?
UHURA	I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

UHURA	She's not responding...
KIRK	Try the emergency channels...
UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
KIRK	Picture, Mr. Saavik.

UHURA	I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
KIRK	Spock?

UHURA	Mr. Scott on discrete.
KIRK	Scotty, let's have it.

KIRK	On screen.
UHURA	Admiral --
KIRK	Do it, while we have time.

UHURA	... No response, sir.
KIRK	Sensors, Captain?

KIRK	Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
UHURA	I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --

UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
KIRK	We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --

KIRK	Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
SCOTTY	I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
KIRK	Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

KIRK	Midshipman, you're a tiger.
SCOTTY	My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
KIRK	Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
SCOTTY	Give the word, Admiral.
KIRK	Mr. Scott, the word is given.
SCOTTY	Aye, sir.

SCOTTY	<u>WHY</u>?
KIRK	He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.

SCOTTY	The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
KIRK	No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

SCOTTY	Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
KIRK	All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.

SCOTTY	No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
KIRK	He'll die -- !

KIRK	If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, this is Spock.

KIRK	Yes, Spock.
SPOCK'S VOICE	Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
KIRK	Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?

KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
KIRK	I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

KIRK	Meaning you can't even beam us back?
SPOCK'S VOICE	Not at present.

KIRK	Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
SPOCK'S VOICE	Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.

KIRK	And who is this?
PRESTON	Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.

KIRK	Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
PRESTON	Yes, SIR.
KIRK	I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?

PRESTON	I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
KIRK	Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
PRESTON	Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --

PRESTON	Is the word given?
KIRK	The word is given: warp speed.
PRESTON	Aye...

KIRK	I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
SPOCK	I am understandably curious.

KIRK	They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
SPOCK	The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
KIRK	It had the virtue of never having been tried.
SPOCK	Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
KIRK	So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
SPOCK	She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
KIRK	Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.

SPOCK	I know of your fondness for antiques.
KIRK	'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
SPOCK	None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.

KIRK	Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
SPOCK	The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
KIRK	Home.

KIRK	Permission to come aboard, Captain?
SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
KIRK	Yes, we've been through death and life together.

SPOCK	There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
KIRK	To be sure, Captain.

KIRK	Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
SPOCK	Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
KIRK	I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
SPOCK	Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
KIRK	That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
SPOCK	Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
KIRK	But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
SPOCK	You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

KIRK	You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
SPOCK	I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
KIRK	I would not presume to debate you.
SPOCK	That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
KIRK	Or the one.

KIRK	Will you accompany me to the bridge?
SPOCK	I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.

SPOCK	There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
KIRK	How far?
SPOCK	Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
KIRK	Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
SPOCK	It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.

SPOCK	Carol Marcus --
KIRK	Yes.

SPOCK	It literally is Genesis...
KIRK	The power of creation --
SPOCK	Have they proceeded with their experiments?
KIRK	The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --

KIRK	Gentlemen, this isn't --
SPOCK	Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --

SPOCK	What's she doing here?
KIRK	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?

KIRK	Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
SPOCK	It would explain a great many things --

SPOCK	Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
KIRK	Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --

SPOCK	They knew just where to hit us.
KIRK	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
SPOCK	One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
KIRK	Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
SPOCK	Too late --

SPOCK	Not enough against their shields.
KIRK	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?

SPOCK	Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
KIRK	At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...

SPOCK	The prefix code?
KIRK	It's all we've got.

KIRK	You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
SPOCK	The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...

SPOCK	Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
KIRK	Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.

SPOCK	Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
KIRK	And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
SPOCK	Affirmative, Admiral.
KIRK	... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
SPOCK	Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
KIRK	Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
SPOCK	A distinct possibility.
KIRK	Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?

KIRK	All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
SPOCK	Aye sir --
KIRK	Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
SPOCK	Be careful, Jim...

KIRK	What IS working around here?
SPOCK	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
KIRK	That's it?
SPOCK	Best we could do in two hours.

KIRK	Uh oh.
SPOCK	She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
KIRK	Scotty, can we make it inside?

SPOCK	I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
KIRK	Best speed, Scotty...

SPOCK	Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
KIRK	Steady as you go...

SPOCK	Admiral, they're reducing speed.
KIRK	Uhura, patch me in --

SPOCK	Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
KIRK	He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
SPOCK	He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...

KIRK	Spock!
SPOCK	The ship -- out of danger?
KIRK	Yes --

KIRK	... the good of the few...
SPOCK	Or the one.

SPOCK	I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
KIRK	Spock...!
SPOCK	I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.

KIRK	Kirk here.
UHURA'S VOICE	I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
KIRK	In my quarters, Uhura.
UHURA'S VOICE	Yes, sir.

KIRK	Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
UHURA'S VOICE	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
KIRK	Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.

KIRK	Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
UHURA'S VOICE	Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
KIRK	Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...

SAAVIK	Any suggestions, Admiral?
KIRK	Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.

KIRK	Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
SAAVIK	Permission to speak candidly, sir?
KIRK	Very well.
SAAVIK	I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
KIRK	And why not?
SAAVIK	Because... there was no way to win.
KIRK	A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
SAAVIK	... No, sir. It has not.
KIRK	How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
SAAVIK	As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
KIRK	Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.

KIRK	Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
SAAVIK	It is still regulation, Admiral.

SAAVIK	May I speak, sir?
KIRK	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
SAAVIK	I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
KIRK	You earned it.
SAAVIK	I did not think so.
KIRK	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
SAAVIK	I failed to resolve the situation.
KIRK	There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
SAAVIK	May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
KIRK	You may ask, Lieutenant.

KIRK	That was a little joke.
SAAVIK	Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
KIRK	We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

SAAVIK	Yes.
KIRK	Take the test again.

KIRK	This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
SAAVIK	Energize defense fields.

KIRK	Khan!
SAAVIK	Who?

SAAVIK	Reliant's command...
KIRK	HURRY.

SAAVIK	On screen...
KIRK	We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...

SAAVIK	Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
KIRK	There is no such regulation.

SAAVIK	Indeterminate life signs.
KIRK	Phasers on stun. Move out.

SAAVIK	That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
KIRK	Erased...

SAAVIK	It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
KIRK	If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
SAAVIK	Stage Two of what?

SAAVIK	Admiral?
KIRK	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.

KIRK	What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.

KIRK	Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK	On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

SAAVIK	How?
KIRK	I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
SAAVIK	<u>WHAT</u>?
KIRK	I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
SAAVIK	Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...

SAAVIK	But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
KIRK	Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

KIRK	Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
SAAVIK	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'

SAAVIK	That was close --
KIRK	They just don't want us going in there.

KIRK	Hold your course. Look sharp...
SAAVIK	At what.

KIRK	Mr. Saavik, all stop.
SAAVIK	All stop, sir.
KIRK	Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.

KIRK	Cease fire. Look sharp.
SAAVIK	Power levels quite low, sir.
KIRK	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?

KIRK	Saavik, get us out, best speed!
SAAVIK	Aye, sir.

KIRK	Time from my mark...
SAAVIK	Two minutes, ten seconds.
KIRK	Engine room! What's happening?!

KIRK	Time!
SAAVIK	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
KIRK	Distance from Reliant...

KIRK	After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
KIRK	I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
SAAVIK	Understood, sir.
KIRK	Dismiss the company.

SAAVIK	Admiral on the bridge!
KIRK	As you were, Mr. Saavik.
SAAVIK	Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
KIRK	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --

KIRK	Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
SAAVIK	Aye, sir --

KIRK	I really must thank you.
SULU	I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
KIRK	I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
SULU	Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
KIRK	You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.

KIRK	Stop engines.
SULU	Stop engines.

SULU	Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
KIRK	Engage warp engines --

SULU	Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
KIRK	Visual.

KIRK	Mr. Sulu... The shields!
SULU	Trying, sir!

SULU	I can't get power, sir!
KIRK	Scotty!

KIRK	Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
SULU	Phasers locked...

SULU	Sir, you did it.
KIRK	<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --

SULU	Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
KIRK	Try again.

SULU	Admiral on the bridge --
KIRK	Battle stations.

SULU	Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
KIRK	Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.

SULU	Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
SAAVIK	Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
SULU	Aye, Captain.

SULU	May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
SAAVIK	I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
SULU	... Now entering the Neutral Zone...

SULU	Shields activated!
SAAVIK	Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...

SAAVIK	We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
SULU	I'll try, Captain.

SAAVIK	Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
SULU	Aft thrusters, sir.

SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
SAAVIK	Course heading, Captain?

SAAVIK	Prepare for warp speed.
SULU	Ready, sir.

SAAVIK	We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
SULU	Honors -- hup!

SAAVIK	Fire all phasers...!
SPOCK	No power to the weapons system, sir.

SAAVIK	He's not what I expected, Sir.
SPOCK	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK	He's very human.
SPOCK	We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.

SPOCK	Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
SAAVIK	Aye, sir.

SAAVIK	All moorings are clear, Captain.
SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

SPOCK	Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
SAAVIK	Never, sir.

SPOCK	Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
SAAVIK	Aye, sir.

SAAVIK	Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
SPOCK	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
SAAVIK	Aye, sir.

SPOCK	Certainly...
SAAVIK	By the book...

SAAVIK	You lied.
SPOCK	I exaggerated.

ADMIRAL HAYES	The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
PICARD	Absolutely.
ADMIRAL HAYES	Good hunting. Hayes out.
PICARD	Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.

PICARD	Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
ADMIRAL HAYES	It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
PICARD	We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
ADMIRAL HAYES	I look forward to reading your report.

PICARD	Montana.  Energize.
BEVERLY	Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --

BEVERLY	Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
PICARD	We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
BEVERLY	Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
PICARD	Yes...
BEVERLY	But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
PICARD	I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
BEVERLY	Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?

PICARD	It's Cochrane.
BEVERLY	I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.

PICARD	It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
BEVERLY	Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
PICARD	As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...

BEVERLY	What are we waiting for? Let's go.
PICARD	It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
BEVERLY	Are you saying they won't help us?
PICARD	I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
BEVERLY	There must be some good people... even in this time.
PICARD	Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.

BEVERLY	He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
PICARD	Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
BEVERLY	That'll be interesting.

PICARD	I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
BEVERLY	I'll be fine.  He's a different story.

PICARD	You actually performed surgery...?
BEVERLY	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

BEVERLY	But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
PICARD	How did Doctor Almack react to that?
BEVERLY	He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
PICARD	Not yet.
BEVERLY	You think they're still up there?
PICARD	If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
BEVERLY	That might not be so bad... at least for you.

PICARD	Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
BEVERLY	You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
PICARD	Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
BEVERLY	I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.

DOCTOR	How long has he been unconscious?
BEVERLY	At least four hours.

DOCTOR	Is it Japanese?
BEVERLY	Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
DOCTOR	We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.

BEVERLY	His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
DOCTOR	Bag him.

BEVERLY	The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
DOCTOR	I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.

DATA	You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
BORG QUEEN	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...

BORG QUEEN	Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
DATA	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.

BORG QUEEN	You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
DATA	I do not know what you are referring to.
BORG QUEEN	That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.

BORG QUEEN	Do you know what this is, Data?
DATA	It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
BORG QUEEN	What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.

DATA	No. I will not betray my friends.
BORG QUEEN	They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
DATA	That is not true. They have tried to help me.
BORG QUEEN	Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
DATA	I... do not want this...

BORG QUEEN	You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
DATA	I wish to... go back to the way I was.
BORG QUEEN	More lies.

BORG QUEEN	Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
DATA	My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
BORG QUEEN	I'm your creator now.

DATA	I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
BORG QUEEN	A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?

DATA	Yes...
BORG QUEEN	Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.

BORG QUEEN	I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
DATA	No... no, please... you cannot...

BORG QUEEN	Isn't it better like this...?
DATA	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
BORG QUEEN	... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...

DATA	No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
BORG QUEEN	And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.

DATA	There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
BORG QUEEN	Vulcan?
DATA	No.

BORG QUEEN	Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
DATA	The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
BORG QUEEN	Can you configure it?
DATA	I believe so.
BORG QUEEN	Do it.

DATA	Dispersive armor is holding.
PICARD	Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.

DATA	The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
PICARD	Ready quantum torpedo.

DATA	We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
PICARD	Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
DATA	It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
PICARD	What?

DATA	I have helm control.
PICARD	Where's the Sphere?

DATA	The vortex is collapsing, sir.
PICARD	Contact Starfleet Command.

PICARD	What year is it?
DATA	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.

PICARD	Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
DATA	Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.

WOMAN'S VOICE	But now... they are all one with the Borg.
DATA	I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
WOMAN'S VOICE	You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.

DATA	Who are you?
WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the Borg.
DATA	That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.

DATA	The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
TROI	But how?

TROI	Did you know her?
DATA	Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.

TROI	Data... are you sure you're all right?
DATA	I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
TROI	We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.

DATA	No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
TROI	I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.

DOCTOR	APR cell count? What the hell are you talking about?
PICARD	Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

PICARD	Juice?
DOCTOR	Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.

PICARD	Where's the battery room for the hospital?
DOCTOR	I told you, there's no --
PICARD	Where?
DOCTOR	Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.

DOCTOR	What did you do to the batteries?
PICARD	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?

GEORDI	Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
PICARD	Understood. Keep me informed.

GEORDI	I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
PICARD	Let's go.

GEORDI	This must be it.
PICARD	How serious is the damage?
GEORDI	I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
PICARD	Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.

GEORDI	I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
PICARD	There should be an access hatch nearby...

GEORDI	Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
PICARD	I have the password right here.

GEORDI	Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
PICARD	There should be some kind of manual release...

PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
GEORDI	It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.

GEORDI	This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
PICARD	Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
GEORDI	Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
PICARD	We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
GEORDI	We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.

GEORDI	Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
PICARD	If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.

PICARD	Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
GEORDI	They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.

PICARD	Ready to make a little history?
GEORDI	Always am.
PICARD	Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.

PICARD	We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
GEORDI	Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
PICARD	She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.

GEORDI	Captain --
PICARD	This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.

GEORDI	Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
PICARD	It'll have to wait. Come on.

GEORDI	No... the door's too thick.
PICARD	Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
GEORDI	What's still there?
PICARD	Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...

GEORDI	Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
PICARD	Altitude fifty kilometers...
GEORDI	Entering the upper ionospere...
PICARD	There's a red light on the second intake valve.
GEORDI	Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...

GEORDI	Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
PICARD	As they used to say... all systems are go.

GEORDI	The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
PICARD	Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
GEORDI	The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
PICARD	<U>Engage.</U>

PICARD	Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
GEORDI	I'm on it...

GEORDI	The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
PICARD	Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.

GEORDI	There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
PICARD	One minute to warp threshold...

GEORDI	Captain, the Enterprise!
PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?

PICARD	Their com system must still be down.
GEORDI	Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.

GEORDI	They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
PICARD	We're crossing the threshold!

PICARD'S VOICE	Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
GEORDI'S VOICE	It'll be tight, but we should make it.
PICARD'S VOICE	What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
GEORDI'S VOICE	I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
PICARD'S VOICE	Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.

GEORDI'S VOICE	ATR setting...
PICARD'S VOICE	Active.
GEORDI'S VOICE	Main bus...
PICARD'S VOICE	Ready.
GEORDI'S VOICE	Initiate pre-ignition sequence.

PICARD	Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
SCRIMM	Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard.
SCRIMM	Great name. French?
PICARD	Yes.
SCRIMM	You don't sound French.

SCRIMM	Where in the States?
PICARD	Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
SCRIMM	Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.

SCRIMM	Where are you from most recently?
PICARD	California. San Francisco.
SCRIMM	Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
PICARD	There's a few of us left.

SCRIMM	That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
PICARD	It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
SCRIMM	Huh.

SCRIMM	And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
PICARD	I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
SCRIMM	Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
PICARD	Yes.
SCRIMM	Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
PICARD	I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

SCRIMM	You seem to have an answer for everything.
PICARD	Something wrong with that?
SCRIMM	Not yet.

PICARD	What do you want?
SCRIMM	The invasion plans.
PICARD	Invasion.
SCRIMM	These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?

PICARD	There is no invasion...
SCRIMM	Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.

PICARD	From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
SCRIMM	And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
PICARD	I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.

RUBY	Take care of him. He's a very special man.
PICARD	Yes, he is.

RUBY	What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
PICARD	Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
RUBY	Thank God this plate was already fixed.

PICARD	Cochrane?
RUBY	Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
PICARD	I'm very sorry.

RUBY	Did you need something?
PICARD	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
RUBY	Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
PICARD	Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?

RUBY	Money. So you can get dome money...
PICARD	I can try.
RUBY	You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?

PICARD	No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
RUBY	Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
PICARD	I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
RUBY	'Fraid not.

PICARD	What?
RUBY	You're lying.
PICARD	What makes you say that?
RUBY	You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
PICARD	Are you always sucha good judge of character?

PICARD	Were the two of you... involved?
RUBY	No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
PICARD	How did you know about that?

PICARD	Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
RUBY	I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
PICARD	It can't wait until tomorrow...
RUBY	Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.

PICARD	I'd say you already have.
RUBY	Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.

RUBY	Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
PICARD	We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
RUBY	We?
PICARD	Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
RUBY	Friends from Cornell...
PICARD	Some.
RUBY	Lie. That's one. Keep going.
PICARD	A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
RUBY	All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
PICARD	We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
RUBY	Or...?

PICARD	Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
RUBY	And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
PICARD	I am not a thief...

RUBY	You're leaving, aren't you?
PICARD	I have to...
RUBY	Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
PICARD	No. It's a lot further than that.
RUBY	It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
PICARD	No... I'm from France.
RUBY	I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
PICARD	That's impossible.
RUBY	Why?
PICARD	This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
RUBY	You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.

PICARD	Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
TROI	Aye, sir.

TROI	Incoming transmission from the Borg.
PICARD	On screen.

PICARD	Life signs?
TROI	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.

TROI	Captain...?
PICARD	We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.

PICARD	Track their weapons fire.
TROI	Western hemisphere... North American continent...

WORF	Port battery, ready sir!
PICARD	Fire.

PICARD	Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
WORF	Aye, sir.

WORF	Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
PICARD	Data, set a course for that vortex.

WORF	Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
PICARD	Steady as she goes.

WORF	Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
PICARD	Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
WORF	Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
PICARD	Go to manual.

WORF	Target locked!
PICARD	Fire!

PICARD	Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
WORF	Aye, sir.

WORF	Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
PICARD	Onscreen.

RIKER	We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
PICARD	Worf... torpedo... now!

PICARD	They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
RIKER	They did it... they assimilated Earth.

PICARD	Report.
RIKER	We're still in Earth orbit.
PICARD	On screen.

RIKER	Looks like they damaged the silo...
PICARD	Life signs?
RIKER	Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.

RIKER	Captain?
PICARD	In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
RIKER	And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
PICARD	Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.

RIKER	Good luck, sir.
PICARD	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.

PICARD	Return to our own time?
RIKER	Yes, sir.
PICARD	Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?

RIKER	Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
PICARD	Unless you'd like to stay.
RIKER	No, sir.

RIKER	Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
WORF	Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.

WORF	I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
RIKER	Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.

WORF	A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
RIKER	What?

RIKER	What the hell is happening, Worf?
WORF	It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

WORF	We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
RIKER	We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.

WORF	To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
RIKER	We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.

RIKER	What are they doing?
WORF	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

WORF	They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
RIKER	Computer -- thermal enhancement.

RIKER	They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
WORF	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...

WORF	We have to stop them from sending that message.
RIKER	Agreed. Options?
WORF	Destroy the deflector dish.

WORF	You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
RIKER	I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
WORF	The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.

WORF	Are you alright?
RIKER	Just a little queasy...
WORF	Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
RIKER	Right.
WORF	And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
RIKER	I'll keep that in mind.

RIKER	Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
WORF	Understood!

RIKER	Report!
WORF	We've lost Bridge control!
RIKER	Emergency override!
WORF	Nothing.

RIKER	Report.
TROI	We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --

TROI	Someone...?
RIKER	The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
TROI	Wil... Data was down there.
RIKER	Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.

RIKER	All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
TROI	Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?

TROI	They're bypassing Engineering...
RIKER	Where the hell are they going?

TROI	To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
RIKER	Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?

RIKER	I remember it made me sick.
TROI	What are you suggesting?
RIKER	I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...

TROI	I have to admit there was a moment there when --
RIKER	Hold that thought.

WORF	Worf to Bridge.
RIKER'S COM VOICE	Riker here.
WORF	There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.

WORF	Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
RIKER'S COM VOICE	Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?

RIKER'S COM VOICE	Worf? Is something wrong?
WORF	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.

RIKER'S COM VOICE	What the hell happened down there, Worf?
WORF	Commander... we have a problem.

WORF	No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
TROI	Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.

TROI	Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
WORF	Target...

TROI	Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
WORF	There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.

TROI	Even Data?
WORF	Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...

TROI	They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
WORF	What kind of message?

BUD	Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
ONE NIGHT	I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.

BUD	This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
ONE NIGHT	Piece of cake, baby.

ONE NIGHT	Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
BUD	Where're you?

ONE NIGHT	Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
BUD	There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
ONE NIGHT	Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
BUD	We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
ONE NIGHT	Okay, good reason.  Then what?
BUD	It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
ONE NIGHT	She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
BUD	Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!

BUD	You done impressing yourself, ace?
ONE NIGHT	No way that could just be seawater.

SONNY	She-hit.
BUD	We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.

BUD	How you guys doing?
SONNY	I'm alright, I'm dealing.

SONNY	You got it?!  You got it?
BUD	Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

SONNY	Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
BUD	Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.

BUD	Nice shot, Lins.
SONNY	What is that?  You drop your dive light?

JAMMER	Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
BUD	Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

JAMMER	What's goin' on, Boss?
BUD	Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.

BUD	Okay so far.
JAMMER	How deep's the drop-off here?

JAMMER	Where are we?
BUD	Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

JAMMER	Lord Almighty.
BUD	Hey, you okay?

BUD	Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
JAMMER	I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
BUD	I'm taking you back out.
JAMMER	No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.

BUD	Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
JAMMER	Yeah, okay.  Okay.

BUD	Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
JAMMER	Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.

LINDSEY	I can't believe you let them do this!
BUD	Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
LINDSEY	I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
BUD	Wasn't up to me.
LINDSEY	We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
BUD	Your rig?
LINDSEY	My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
BUD	Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
LINDSEY	You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
BUD	I'm switching off now.
LINDSEY	Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--

BUD	Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
LINDSEY	Not for long.

BUD	You never did like being called that, did you?
LINDSEY	Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
BUD	Who else?

BUD	I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
LINDSEY	Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

LINDSEY	You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
BUD	Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.

BUD	You wanna know what I think?
LINDSEY	Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.

BUD	I think you were worried about me.
LINDSEY	That must be it.

BUD	No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
LINDSEY	I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
BUD	Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.

LINDSEY	What are you still wearing that for?
BUD	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.

LINDSEY	I haven't worn mine in months.
BUD	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
LINDSEY	Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.

BUD	So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
LINDSEY	No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
BUD	What happened?
LINDSEY	Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
BUD	I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
LINDSEY	You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.

BUD	Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
LINDSEY	No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
BUD	Fine.  Be that way.
LINDSEY	I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
BUD	But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
LINDSEY	No.
BUD	Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

LINDSEY	Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
BUD	His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
LINDSEY	But what did he see that made him panic?
BUD	What do you think he saw?
LINDSEY	I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

BUD	Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
LINDSEY	Cute, Virgil.

BUD	What's the scoop, ace?
LINDSEY	I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.

BUD	Need some help?
LINDSEY	Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
BUD	What about O-2?
LINDSEY	Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
BUD	The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
LINDSEY	I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.

BUD	Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
LINDSEY	Yeah?  Well I'm not.

LINDSEY	Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
BUD	If you say so.  It could be anything.
LINDSEY	I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.

BUD	Jesus, Lindsey--
LINDSEY	Bud, something really important is happening here.
BUD	Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
LINDSEY	Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

BUD	All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
LINDSEY	I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
BUD	God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
LINDSEY	I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
BUD	No.
LINDSEY	Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

LINDSEY	It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
BUD	How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
LINDSEY	We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.

LINDSEY	Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
BUD	Lindsey!  Wait a second--

LINDSEY	You dumb jarhead motherf--
BUD	Chill out, Lindsey!!

LINDSEY	He's got the shakes?
BUD	Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

BUD	I think it likes you.
LINDSEY	It's trying to communicate.

LINDSEY	They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
BUD	Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.

BUD	He's jammed the mechanism.
LINDSEY	Now what?

BUD	Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
LINDSEY	Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
BUD	Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

LINDSEY	You owe me one, Virgil.
BUD	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

LINDSEY	You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
BUD	Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
LINDSEY	Not in this thing.

BUD	You totaled it, huh?
LINDSEY	Yeah.  So sue me.

BUD	It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
LINDSEY	You noticed.

BUD	Try again.
LINDSEY	Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--

LINDSEY	Well, that's that.
BUD	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...

BUD	Good hundred yards, I'd say.
LINDSEY	They'll come out after us.
BUD	Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

LINDSEY	You see where it's coming in?
BUD	Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

BUD	Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
LINDSEY	I don't know, look around.

BUD	Son of a bitch!
LINDSEY	Calm down, Bud.

BUD	Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
LINDSEY	How?
BUD	I don't know how!
LINDSEY	We've only got one suit.
BUD	I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
LINDSEY	Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

LINDSEY	Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
BUD	Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--

BUD	Alright, put this on.
LINDSEY	What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
BUD	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
LINDSEY	No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

BUD	Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
LINDSEY	NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
BUD	FUCK LOGIC!!

LINDSEY	Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
BUD	What's the plan?
LINDSEY	I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
BUD	WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

BUD	It is insane.
LINDSEY	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

BUD	Oh God, Lins... I--
LINDSEY	Tell me later.

LINDSEY	Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
BUD	Hi, lady.
LINDSEY	Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
BUD	'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
LINDSEY	I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?

LINDSEY	No, Bud, no... not you.
BUD	Who then?

LINDSEY	Hello, Brigman.
BUD	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

COFFEY	We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
BUD	Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

BUD	Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
COFFEY	I can't afford slack, Brigman.
BUD	Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
COFFEY	I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.

COFFEY	We'll go in through that large breach.
BUD	Let's go, guys.

BUD	Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
COFFEY	Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.

BUD	Did you find Wilhite?
COFFEY	No.

HIPPY	Virgil?
BUD	God, I hate that bitch.
HIPPY	Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

BUD	Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
HIPPY	Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

BUD	What's the matter with you?
HIPPY	Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.

HIPPY	No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
BUD	Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
HIPPY	Everything is.

HIPPY	That's Perry.
BUD	That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
HIPPY	Do we just leave him there?
BUD	Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.

HIPPY	Come on, man.  What else could it be?
BUD	Why bring it here?
HIPPY	It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

BUD	Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
HIPPY	Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?

BUD	Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
HIPPY	Got it. Over.
BUD	Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

BUD	Is that it?  Is this right?
HIPPY	Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
BUD	All right.  Do it!

BUD	Hey, you guys are milking that job.
CATFISH	That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.

CATFISH	Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
BUD	We're here now.  Let's get her done.

BUD	He's convulsing!
CATFISH	It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

BUD	'Fish'?
CATFISH	Yuh?
BUD	Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?

BUD	Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
CATFISH	I can't... make it... podner.

CATFISH	Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
LINDSEY	Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
CATFISH	Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

LINDSEY	Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
CATFISH	You watch yourself.

LINDSEY	You better not say you missed that.
CATFISH	Missed what?

CATFISH	Y'all could be more specific.
LINDSEY	Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...

LINDSEY	I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
CATFISH	Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

LINDSEY	We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
CATFISH	Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.

CATFISH	Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
HIPPY	Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.

CATFISH	Hippy, you pussy.
HIPPY	What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?

CATFISH	Quiet!  Quiet!
HIPPY	Turn it up, bozo.

CATFISH	Are we talkin' little space friend here?
HIPPY	Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--

HIPPY	That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
CATFISH	Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

HIPPY	SHIT!
CATFISH	Give me that!!

COFFEY	Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
LINDSEY	Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?

LINDSEY	Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
COFFEY	We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
LINDSEY	Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...

COFFEY	Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
LINDSEY	Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

COFFEY	Cab One, do you see it yet?
LINDSEY	The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?

COFFEY	Cab One, radiation readings?
LINDSEY	Neutron counter's not showing very much.
COFFEY	Wilhite, anything?

LINDSEY	Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
COFFEY	Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
LINDSEY	Copy that.

COFFEY	Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
LINDSEY	How many are there?
COFFEY	24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
LINDSEY	That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?

COFFEY	I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
LINDSEY	Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.

LINDSEY	You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
COFFEY	You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
LINDSEY	You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
COFFEY	Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.

LINDSEY	Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
HIPPY	Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?

HIPPY	Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
LINDSEY	What's you depth, Cab Three?
HIPPY	1840... 50... 60... 70...
LINDSEY	Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.

LINDSEY	Figured that out for yourself, did you?
HIPPY	We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?

LINDSEY	A non-terrestrial intelligence.
HIPPY	Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

LINDSEY	Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
HIPPY	Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
LINDSEY	Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

LINDSEY	No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
HIPPY	I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.

LINDSEY	Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
HIPPY	That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

HIPPY	He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
LINDSEY	He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.

HIPPY	12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
LINDSEY	Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

HIPPY	Uh, oh...
LINDSEY	What kind of luminous things, Bud?

MONK	Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
HIPPY	How deep?
MONK	Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.

HIPPY	Hey!
MONK	Check this out.

MONK	Stand by on the ROV.
HIPPY	Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?

MONK	Getting a reading?
HIPPY	It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.

HIPPY	You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
MONK	What's the timer set for?

MONK	High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
LINDSEY	Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

MONK	4800 feet.  It's official.
LINDSEY	Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

LINDSEY	8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
MONK	Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
LINDSEY	Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

MONK	He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
LINDSEY	Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.

MONK	He can still make it.
LINDSEY	I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...

LINDSEY	What kind of light?
MONK	He's hallucinating badly.

LINDSEY	Would we see the flash?
MONK	Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

REVNA	Headache?  Dehydration?
ACKLAND	The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
REVNA	Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.

ACKLAND	Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
REVNA	Sure.

REVNA	What is it?
ACKLAND	It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
REVNA	Do you want a tablet?

REVNA	Better?
ACKLAND	Yeah...

ACKLAND	Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
YORK	Do you wanna head back and call it in?

YORK	Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
ACKLAND	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

ACKLAND	It's a rhino.
YORK	Is it dead?
ACKLAND	No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.

YORK	Yeah, it's fine.
ACKLAND	God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
YORK	I told you we... what's that?

ACKLAND	Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
YORK	Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

YORK	Let's get back and call this in.
ACKLAND	Wait a minute.

BEAUVAIS	Nice howitzer you've got there.
MINH	Thanks.
BEAUVAIS	Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
MINH	Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.

BEAUVAIS	We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
MINH	Oh man...

BEAUVAIS	Minh...
MINH	Yep...

PARSONS	That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
CASSIE	Better tell the boss.

CASSIE	A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
PARSONS	We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
CASSIE	Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.

PARSONS	Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
CASSIE	Okay, give me the numbers.

CASSIE	What do you need?
PARSONS	A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
CASSIE	It's on the board.

PARSONS	Seal everything now!
CASSIE	What's happening?
PARSONS	Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
CASSIE	We're what!?

CASSIE	How many of them are there?
PARSONS	Too many.

PARSONS	Give or take.
CASSIE	We're not gonna make it, are we?

CASSIE	Are you alright?
PARSONS	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?

PARSONS	Where is she?
CASSIE	Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
PARSONS	Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.

CASSIE	I found it...
PARSONS	And?
CASSIE	Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
PARSONS	Get her on-line.  Now!

CASSIE	I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
PARSONS	Keep trying!

CASSIE	MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
KAMEN	Shit.  When?
CASSIE	Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

KAMEN	Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
CASSIE	You win some, you loose some.
KAMEN	I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
CASSIE	No, but I got something that might interest you.

CASSIE	Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
HIROKO	Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.

HIROKO	Where're they headed?
CASSIE	We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

HIROKO	When?
CASSIE	Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
HIROKO	Can we move it to a different orbit in time?

CASSIE	Picking up velocity.
HIROKO	Match it!

HIROKO	What's going on?
CASSIE	The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
HIROKO	Force the door.

CASSIE	It's too late!
HIROKO	Nooooo!

CASSIE	Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
HIROKO	What's our weapons situation?

CASSIE	Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
HIROKO	Has anybody talked to them?
CASSIE	Not yet.
HIROKO	Do it.

CASSIE	Oh, man...
HIROKO	Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.

HIROKO	How much air-time have I got?
CASSIE	About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
HIROKO	Deal.
CASSIE	We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.

HIROKO	If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
CASSIE	But...

DE VRIES	C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
GUTTIEREZ	One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
DE VRIES	Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
GUTTIEREZ	Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.

GUTTIEREZ	Listen to what?
DE VRIES	That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.

GUTTIEREZ	De Vries?
DE VRIES	Yeah?
GUTTIEREZ	Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

DE VRIES	Something spooking the rhinos?
GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.

DE VRIES	Hey, Guttierez?
GUTTIEREZ	What?
DE VRIES	Take a look at this.

GUTTIEREZ	One of 'em must have escaped.
DE VRIES	That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.

GUTTIEREZ	There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
DE VRIES	Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
GUTTIEREZ	That's a fact.

GUTTIEREZ	Whoa, wait a minute...
DE VRIES	What?
GUTTIEREZ	Just got a reading...

DE VRIES	What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
GUTTIEREZ	I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
DE VRIES	Forget it, man.
GUTTIEREZ	C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
DE VRIES	Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.

DE VRIES	What the hell are you doing?
GUTTIEREZ	Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

DE VRIES	Alright, okay.  Look...
GUTTIEREZ	What?
DE VRIES	I'll come with you.

DE VRIES	But I'm going first...
GUTTIEREZ	Anything you say, Mammacitta.

DE VRIES	Careful of that edging there...
GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I got it.

DE VRIES	Still got him?
GUTTIEREZ	It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.

GUTTIEREZ	Hold it, hold it...
DE VRIES	What's wrong?
GUTTIEREZ	I'm picking up another signal.

DE VRIES	What?  Where?
GUTTIEREZ	Just behind us, over to the right.

DE VRIES	Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I...

GUTTIEREZ	Wait.  Lost it.
DE VRIES	How?
GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.  Might be a glitch.

DE VRIES	Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
GUTTIEREZ	It's alright, it's cool...
DE VRIES	Is it still moving?
GUTTIEREZ	No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...

GUTTIEREZ	Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
DE VRIES	Couple more seconds!

DILLER	Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
HIROKO	Thanks.

HIROKO	What happened?
DILLER	York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

DILLER	Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
HIROKO	Where does that lead to?

HIROKO	Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
DILLER	Okay.
HIROKO	One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.

DRISCOLL	Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
HIROKO	Auto-shop?

HIROKO	That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
DRISCOLL	Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
HIROKO	Which mean physically going outside.

HIROKO	Is this the suit?
DRISCOLL	Uh-huh.

DRISCOLL	Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
HIROKO	Sounds great.

DRISCOLL	We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
HIROKO	How tight are these shafts?

KAMEN	Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
GUTTIEREZ	What's the problem?
KAMEN	She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
GUTTIEREZ	Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
KAMEN	Appreciate that.

KAMEN	And...?
GUTTIEREZ	And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.

PARSONS	That's what we thought.
HIROKO	Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
PARSONS	Done it already.  Nothing matches.

PARSONS	Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
HIROKO	Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.

PARSONS	Already working on it.
HIROKO	Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.

PARSONS	They've changed their heading again.
HIROKO	Compensate!
PARSONS	Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.

PARSONS	It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
HIROKO	What is that?

PARSONS	Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
HIROKO	You've checked that end?

PARSONS	Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
HIROKO	How many... how many people are missing?

HIROKO	They knocked out the external feeds.
PARSONS	Looks like it.

PARSONS	Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
HIROKO	Well... try the headset.

PARSONS	It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
HIROKO	What?  Why?

PARSONS	There's still time to back-out.
HIROKO	Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?

HIROKO	Thanks.
PARSONS	Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
HIROKO	Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...

HIROKO	Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
PARSONS	Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.

HIROKO	Okay, we're in business.
PARSONS	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?

HIROKO	Okay, I'm out of here!
PARSONS	Blow those suckers, Driscoll!

KAMEN	See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
HIROKO	We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.

KAMEN	Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
HIROKO	I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
KAMEN	Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?

HIROKO	I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
KAMEN	Not too much of the socializing type, then?
HIROKO	No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.

HIROKO	I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
KAMEN	Is that a fact.
HIROKO	Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
KAMEN	How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
HIROKO	Four.
KAMEN	And before that?
HIROKO	Six month stint on Datus.
KAMEN	Only six?
HIROKO	What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
KAMEN	Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.

KAMEN	What is that?
HIROKO	Real man' drink.

KAMEN	Seltzer?
HIROKO	Want some?

HIROKO	Any luck raising Ackland's party?
KAMEN	Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
HIROKO	First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
KAMEN	'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
HIROKO	Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.

KAMEN	Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
HIROKO	Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
KAMEN	There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

KAMEN	Yeah.  Somebody won.
HIROKO	Check out the tent.

KAMEN	I've found Ackland!
HIROKO	Hold on...

HIROKO	I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
KAMEN	Agreed.
HIROKO	When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
KAMEN	Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
HIROKO	What do you mean?

KAMEN	Think I spoke too soon...
HIROKO	Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

KAMEN	Do you believe him?
HIROKO	Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.

KAMEN	Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
HIROKO	Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.

HIROKO	So, what do you think?
KAMEN	What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.

HIROKO	What?
KAMEN	I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!

HIROKO	That's the wrong way!
KAMEN	Detour.  Other way's blocked...

HIROKO	Hurry it up.
KAMEN	Don't wait for me!

KAMEN	They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
HIROKO	What can I do?
KAMEN	I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
HIROKO	I... I can't!
KAMEN	You have to...
HIROKO	No!

PARSONS	Where'd you leave them?
KAMEN	Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.

KAMEN	Jesus.
PARSONS	Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
KAMEN	Tactical nukes, maybe?

KAMEN	How's it going?
PARSONS	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

PARSONS	Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
KAMEN	You should hit the sack, too.
PARSONS	Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
KAMEN	What time's sundown?
PARSONS	'Bout five minutes.
KAMEN	Give me a yell is something happens.
PARSONS	You got it, cowboy.

KNOX	How high up would you say that is?
ALFRED	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
KNOX	You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
ALFRED	Which bathroom is that, sir?
KNOX	The small one.

ALFRED	Yes?
KNOX	Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
ALFRED	Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
KNOX	Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?

ALFRED	Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
BRUCE	Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.

BRUCE	It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
ALFRED	... Very good, sir.

BRUCE	Where's the boy?
ALFRED	Upstairs. He's quite docile.
BRUCE	I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
ALFRED	Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.

BRUCE	How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
ALFRED	Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
BRUCE	If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.

JOKER	Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
BATMAN	Take me. Let the boy go.
JOKER	Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
BATMAN	What are you talking about?
JOKER	Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.

JOKER	You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
BATMAN	... Murderer...
JOKER	Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.

BATMAN	GET IN THE CAR!!
VICKI	WHICH CAR?

VICKI	Look! Police!
BATMAN	I know. I called them.
VICKI	Shouldn't we --

VICKI	What about the girl?
BATMAN	He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!

VICKI	Can't we --
BATMAN	Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!

BATMAN	How much do you weigh?
VICKI	... A hundred and eight?

BATMAN	...Not even a 'thank you'?
VICKI	Well -- I think you might consider

BATMAN	I'll have to ask you for that film.
VICKI	I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.

BATMAN	Please.
VICKI	I won't let you have it.

BATMAN	The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
VICKI	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
BATMAN	All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
VICKI	How do I know you won't keep them all?
BATMAN	I'll take you with me.

BATMAN	Thank you, Vicki.
VICKI	... Where are you taking me?

VICKI	... How long have I been out?
BATMAN	Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
VICKI	Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?

VICKI	What is this stuff? Kevlar?
BATMAN	Better. It's not on the market yet.
VICKI	It doesn't protect your head, though.
BATMAN	That's why I wear a target on my chest.

VICKI	How'd you find this place?
BATMAN	Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.

BATMAN	They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
VICKI	I loathe bats.
BATMAN	So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.

VICKI	What is that?
BATMAN	Photo database. I'll do your photos now.

BATMAN	They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
VICKI	That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
BATMAN	No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.

VICKI	I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
BATMAN	I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
VICKI	If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?

BATMAN	Is this what you wanted?
VICKI	You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
BATMAN	I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.

KNOX	I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
BRUCE	Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
KNOX	Great.  Give me a grant.
BRUCE	I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.

KNOX	This is Miss Vale. -- That felt redundant.
BRUCE	You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.

KNOX	That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
BRUCE	What is it you want?
KNOX	I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
BRUCE	I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
KNOX	Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.

KNOX	See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
BRUCE	Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
KNOX	Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.

BRUCE	Do you want a drink?
KNOX	Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
BRUCE	Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.

BRUCE	I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
VICKI	As far as I know.
BRUCE	Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.

VICKI	Do you sail?
BRUCE	Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.

BRUCE	Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
VICKI	That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
BRUCE	No.
VICKI	Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
BRUCE	Odd desire for anyone.
VICKI	Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
BRUCE	What did you see?
VICKI	... Terror.

BRUCE	There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
VICKI	Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.

VICKI	Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
BRUCE	In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
VICKI	As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
BRUCE	I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.

VICKI	I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
BRUCE	Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.

VICKI	But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
BRUCE	I'll take you home if you'd like.
VICKI	God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
BRUCE	Maybe we should just kiss.
VICKI	... We could try that.

BRUCE	I don't sing very well.
VICKI	Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.

VICKI	To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
BRUCE	I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
VICKI	Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.

VICKI	All street mimes should be executed.
BRUCE	... Looks like a convention.

BRUCE	I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
VICKI	Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
BRUCE	I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
VICKI	Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
BRUCE	I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
VICKI	I wish you'd...

BRUCE	Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
VICKI	... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
BRUCE	Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
VICKI	I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !

VICKI	So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
BRUCE	No one would miss me.
VICKI	I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.

BRUCE	Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
VICKI	You're one man. You can't save everybody.
BRUCE	What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?

VICKI	Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
BRUCE	Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.

VICKI	It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
BRUCE	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

VICKI	Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
BRUCE	I feel naked without it.

VICKI	It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up.
BRUCE	The does it. It's going to be this weekend.

BRUCE	Keep her on the line!
VICKI	... Where are you calling from?

VICKI	I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
BRUCE	Finding out where she is.
VICKI	How can you do that if she's already off the line?
BRUCE	I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.

BRUCE	Got it!
VICKI	What now?
BRUCE	Hang on. I have to leave a message.

BRUCE	All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
VICKI	I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
BRUCE	In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?

VICKI	I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
BRUCE	Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
VICKI	I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
BRUCE	Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?

DENT	We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
BRUCE	He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
DENT	All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
BRUCE	I suggest a nice big bomb.
DENT	Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
BRUCE	Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
DENT	We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
BRUCE	Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
DENT	I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.

DRIVER	We got 'em!
JOKER	Take 'em! I want his head!

JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
DRIVER	WHAT?
JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
DRIVER	WHAT??

DRIVER	Boss! Jesus! They've --
JOKER	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!

JOKER	MOVE! Can't you do something??
DRIVER	It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!

JACK	I missed you, Lieutenant.
ECKHARDT	Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
JACK	Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.

ECKHARDT	I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
JACK	Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.

ECKHARDT	I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
JACK	Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.

ECKHARDT	Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
JACK	What are you talking about?
ECKHARDT	About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --

EDDIE	Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
NICK	What are you, scared of heights?
EDDIE	I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
NICK	Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
EDDIE	That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
NICK	Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
EDDIE	Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
NICK	No shit.  It was all over the pavement.

EDDIE	There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
NICK	God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.

EDDIE	My brother's a priest, man.
NICK	No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.

EDDIE	You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
NICK	Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --

JACK	Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
GRISSOM	Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.

JACK	Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
GRISSOM	Because I want someone I can trust.

JACK	I understand.
GRISSOM	Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.

JACK	It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
GRISSOM	Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
JACK	Is that what you "heard"?

GRISSOM	It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
JACK	I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.

GRISSOM	Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
JACK	JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?

GRISSOM	Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
JACK	HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

ROTELLI	I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
JOKER	I've considered that possibility.
ROTELLI	And what happens if we say no?
JOKER	Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
ROTELLI	That's it?
JOKER	That's it.

JOKER	Joker here. Can we talk?
MAYOR	I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
JOKER	Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.

MAYOR	All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
JOKER	Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
MAYOR	Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
JOKER	Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

VICKI	... Thank you.
JOKER	Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.

VICKI	And you want a --
JOKER	A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.

VICKI	Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
JOKER	... Behind the makeup?

VICKI	I've seen worse.  Much worse.
JOKER	Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.

VICKI	... Why the mask?
JOKER	Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

VICKI	You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
JOKER	What?  I improved her a little...

VICKI	I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
JOKER	Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?

VICKI	How'd you know it was me?
KNOX	Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.

VICKI	Burned out.  I need a vacation.
KNOX	Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?

KNOX	God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
VICKI	A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
KNOX	Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
VICKI	Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
KNOX	Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
VICKI	Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
KNOX	Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.

VICKI	No.
KNOX	Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?

KNOX	Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
VICKI	Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.

KNOX	Where does one man get all this junk?
VICKI	All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
KNOX	Holy shit...

VICKI	Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
KNOX	Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
KNOX	I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
VICKI	That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
KNOX	Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.

VICKI	Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
KNOX	What were you thinking?
VICKI	Yum, yum.
KNOX	Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.

VICKI	Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
KNOX	Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

VICKI	Peanuts?
KNOX	Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.

VICKI	Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
KNOX	Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.

KNOX	Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
VICKI	His face.  Allie, look at his face.

KNOX	Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
VICKI	Oh, Bruce...
KNOX	Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?

VICKI	You are on drugs.
KNOX	Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
VICKI	Are they paying you for all this?
KNOX	Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
VICKI	Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
KNOX	... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?

VICKI	He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
KNOX	... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.

VICKI	Alexander... I know you.
KNOX	Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
VICKI	I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
KNOX	Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.

KNOX	The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
VICKI	Allie, he's not.
KNOX	Not what?
VICKI	He's not crazy.

KNOX	Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
VICKI	Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
KNOX	Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
VICKI	It's gone.

KNOX	Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
VICKI	Yeah. Deja vu.
KNOX	What do you say? Let's head for the lights.

VICKI	LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
KNOX	Great. How??

KNOX	HOLY SHIT!!
VICKI	You okay?
KNOX	Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
VICKI	God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
KNOX	Holy shit. Holy...

ABBOTT	Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
CONKLIN	I don't know what we're talking about.
ABBOTT	We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
CONKLIN	You're asking me a direct question?
ABBOTT	Yes.
CONKLIN	I thought you were never going to do that.

ABBOTT	They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
CONKLIN	You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
ABBOTT	And what if I couldn't do that?
CONKLIN	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.

CONKLIN	She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
ABBOTT	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
CONKLIN	We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
ABBOTT	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
CONKLIN	No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
ABBOTT	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.

CONKLIN	We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
ABBOTT	I want a second opinion.
CONKLIN	<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
ABBOTT	I'm not asking.

CONKLIN	That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
ABBOTT	What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
CONKLIN	Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?

ABBOTT	No.  We can't risk it.
CONKLIN	Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
ABBOTT	This doesn't go upstairs.

ABBOTT	-- he went inside! --
CONKLIN	-- if we can get a clean shot --
ABBOTT	-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
CONKLIN	-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
ABBOTT	Forget it.
CONKLIN	What do you want to do?
ABBOTT	We don't know what we're into!
CONKLIN	We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!

CONKLIN	I'm going to Paris.
ABBOTT	<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
CONKLIN	You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
ABBOTT	You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
CONKLIN	I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.

BOURNE	I won't ask again.
PROFESSOR	I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
BOURNE	What do you mean?
PROFESSOR	Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
BOURNE	Treadstone?
PROFESSOR	...which one are you?...

BOURNE	Paris.  I live in Paris...
PROFESSOR	...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
BOURNE	Yes.
PROFESSOR	...it's a problem...

BOURNE	Treadstone.
PROFESSOR	...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
BOURNE	What is Treadstone?
PROFESSOR	...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
BOURNE	I think so.
PROFESSOR	...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
BOURNE	What do they want me to do?
PROFESSOR	...they won't let you go...
BOURNE	Why?

BOURNE	Are you Treadstone?
CONKLIN	Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?

BOURNE	<u>What did you do to me</u>?
CONKLIN	What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
BOURNE	I don't know.
CONKLIN	They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
BOURNE	I know you've been trying to kill me.
CONKLIN	Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
BOURNE	So now you know.
CONKLIN	So it's time to go home.
BOURNE	That's all I get?
CONKLIN	We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
BOURNE	I don't think so.
CONKLIN	We have to go home, Jason.
BOURNE	Jason Bourne is dead.
CONKLIN	<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
BOURNE	Keep it. 
CONKLIN	Jason...  They can't let you go...
BOURNE	That'll be their second worst mistake.

WOMBOSI	Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
BOURNE	MPG Capital.
WOMBOSI	I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
BOURNE	It's a lot more stressful than I thought.

BOURNE	Who do you think sent me?
WOMBOSI	I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?

WOMBOSI	<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
BOURNE	I don't know.
WOMBOSI	Get the kids out!

WOMAN CLERK	You're a U.S. Citizen?
BOURNE	Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
WOMAN CLERK	Well, either you are, or you aren't.
BOURNE	Right.
WOMAN CLERK	You have your passport?
BOURNE	I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
WOMAN CLERK	<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
BOURNE	Look, maybe I should just...
WOMAN CLERK	Sir, you waited on line.
BOURNE	Yeah, I know...

BOURNE	...yes -- oui -- uh...
BOURNE	Paris?
OPERATOR/PHONE	Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
BOURNE	Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
BOURNE	D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
OPERATOR/PHONE	-- sir? --
BOURNE	-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --

BOURNE	Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, sir.

MANAGER/PHONE	Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
BOURNE	Yes, I'm here...
MANAGER/PHONE	You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
BOURNE	Yes.  Is he there?
MANAGER/PHONE	You are a friend of his?
BOURNE	Yes.
MANAGER/PHONE	I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...

MANAGER/PHONE	There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
BOURNE	...I understand...
MANAGER/PHONE	...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
BOURNE	Who?  Who came?
MANAGER/PHONE	His brother.  You know his brother?
BOURNE	Right.  Yes.  Of course.
MANAGER/PHONE	It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
BOURNE	Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
MANAGER/PHONE	I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.

RAWLINS	Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
BOURNE	Thanks.

RAWLINS	Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
BOURNE	Really.
RAWLINS	We thought you were gone for good.
BOURNE	Did you?
RAWLINS	Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.

RAWLINS	Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
BOURNE	Yes.
RAWLINS	We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
BOURNE	Okay.

RAWLINS	Was it the break-in?
BOURNE	Excuse me?
RAWLINS	We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
BOURNE	I hadn't heard.

RAWLINS	Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
BOURNE	That'd be great.

BOURNE	I need a ride.
BOURNE	I need a ride out of here.
MARIE	Oh, Jesus... 
BOURNE	Please.  I don't want to scare you.
MARIE	It's a little late for that.
BOURNE	I've got a situation here and --
MARIE	Get the fuck away from my car.
BOURNE	I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
MARIE	Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
BOURNE	You don't want the police any more than I do.

MARIE	Jesus...
BOURNE	Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.

MARIE	So what's in Paris?
BOURNE	I want to go home.
MARIE	For twenty thousand dollars.

BOURNE	I said ten thousand.
MARIE	You have blood on your pants.
BOURNE	Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
MARIE	<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
BOURNE	Wait up --  -- just wait up --
MARIE	-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 

BOURNE	Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
MARIE	You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
BOURNE	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.

MARIE	You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
BOURNE	I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
MARIE	And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
BOURNE	I won't hurt you.
MARIE	What if I say no?
BOURNE	Then I'll find another ride.

MARIE	Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
BOURNE	I know that.

MARIE	Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
BOURNE	I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
MARIE	I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
BOURNE	I don't know.
MARIE	What does that mean?
BOURNE	Listen to what you want.
MARIE	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?

BOURNE	I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
MARIE	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
BOURNE	No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
MARIE	What?  Like amnesia?
BOURNE	Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
MARIE	Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
BOURNE	That's what I'm saying.

MARIE	And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
BOURNE	No.
MARIE	When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
BOURNE	Nothing.  It's just not there.
MARIE	Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
BOURNE	I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
MARIE	-- you could put it together --
BOURNE	-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
MARIE	What are you talking about?
BOURNE	I don't know.
MARIE	Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
BOURNE	I was shot twice in the back.
MARIE	Okay, so you're a victim.
BOURNE	There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
MARIE	Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
BOURNE	I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
MARIE	People do amazing things when they're scared.
BOURNE	Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
MARIE	You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.

MARIE	I needed a break.
BOURNE	Where are we?
MARIE	We're about an hour away.
BOURNE	I can't believe I slept.
MARIE	You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
BOURNE	I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.

MARIE	You ever think maybe you have a family?
BOURNE	I thought about it.  I don't know.

BOURNE	Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
MARIE	That's it?  Is that it?

BOURNE	Four-fifty.  That's the address...
MARIE	Looks familiar?
BOURNE	No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...

MARIE	Where?
BOURNE	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.

MARIE	So this is it, right?
BOURNE	I guess.

MARIE	I should go.
BOURNE	I don't remember any of this.
MARIE	Jason...

MARIE	Okay, so...
BOURNE	Thanks for the ride.
MARIE	Anytime.

BOURNE	Look, I don't know what's up there.
MARIE	You got me pretty fucking curious.
BOURNE	Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
MARIE	Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
BOURNE	How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.

MARIE	This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
BOURNE	I guess so.

MARIE	This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
BOURNE	All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
MARIE	See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
BOURNE	Go ahead.

BOURNE	-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
MARIE	-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
BOURNE	-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --

MARIE	-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
BOURNE	Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?

BOURNE	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
MARIE	...omigod, no...

BOURNE	What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
MARIE	...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
BOURNE	-- just --
MARIE	-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
BOURNE	Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
MARIE	-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
BOURNE	-- let me do this, okay? --
MARIE	-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --

MARIE	He's dead isn't he?
BOURNE	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
MARIE	He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
BOURNE	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
MARIE	He came to kill us.
BOURNE	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
MARIE	You knew he was coming.
BOURNE	No.
MARIE	I trusted you.
BOURNE	You're wrong.  I didn't know.
MARIE	I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
BOURNE	I didn't know this would happen.
MARIE	He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
BOURNE	And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
MARIE	Oh, Jesus...
BOURNE	You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
MARIE	But the police --
BOURNE	-- there's no time --
MARIE	-- we'll explain it --
BOURNE	-- how? --
MARIE	-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
BOURNE	-- forget it --
MARIE	-- we'll tell them what happened --
BOURNE	I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!

MARIE	You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
BOURNE	Who paid the bill?
MARIE	It's a company... MPG Capital.

MARIE	I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
BOURNE	Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.

MARIE	-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
BOURNE	Nykwana Wombosi. 
MARIE	What is that?
BOURNE	It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
MARIE	What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
BOURNE	I don't know. 
MARIE	<u>So what are we doing</u>?
BOURNE	Go back to the hotel.

MARIE	It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
BOURNE	You could do that?
MARIE	Yes.  That's who I want to be.

BOURNE	xxxxxx.
MARIE	xxxxxx

BOURNE	Stop where you are.
MARIE	What?

BOURNE	xxxxxx
MARIE	xxxxxx
BOURNE	I won't let that happen.

BOURNE	xxxxxx
MARIE	xxxxxx

MARIE	Who is it?
BOURNE	We have to keep moving.

BOURNE	xxxxxx
MARIE	xxxxxx

MARIE	xxxxxx
BOURNE	xxxxxx

MARIE	xxxxxx
BOURNE	xxxxxx
MARIE	xxxxxx
BOURNE	xxxxxx

MARIE	xxxxxx
BOURNE	xxxxxx

MARIE	And that's it?
BOURNE	If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.

MARIE	What was I thinking, right?
BOURNE	I can't protect you anymore.
MARIE	What about you?
BOURNE	I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.

MARIE	Can I help you?
BOURNE	This your store?
MARIE	Yes.
BOURNE	Think I could rent a scooter?
MARIE	You have ID?
BOURNE	Not really.

BOURNE	Where did this body go?
MORGUE BOSS	I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
BOURNE	Shit, we didn't sign in.
MORGUE BOSS	So get the hell out of here.
BOURNE	Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 

BOURNE	Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
MORGUE BOSS	-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
BOURNE	-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --

MORGUE BOSS	-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
BOURNE	-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
MORGUE BOSS	-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
BOURNE	-- here we go -- I found it --

BOURNE	Where's the dog?
CLERK	My husband's out looking for him.
BOURNE	He run away often?
CLERK	That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?

BOURNE	Get in the basement.
CLERK	What?
BOURNE	Get everyone down in the basement.

CLERK	What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE	You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
CLERK	Wait a minute --
BOURNE	I'm sorry.

CLERK	Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
MARIE	All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
CLERK	<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
MARIE	You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
CLERK	-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
MARIE	-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
CLERK	-- Miss Kreutz, please --
MARIE	-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
CLERK	So now you're asking for a student visa?

CLERK	xxxxxx...
MARIE	xxxxxx

CONKLIN	And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
RESEARCH TECH #1	That's the only angle.
CONKLIN	What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
RESEARCH TECH #1	Hang on... 

RESEARCH TECH #1	Sir...
CONKLIN	What's that?
RESEARCH TECH #1	It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
CONKLIN	Enhance it.

CONKLIN	-- let's check that Interpol window again --
RESEARCH TECH #1	-- I'm on it --
CONKLIN	-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --

CONKLIN	What?
ZORN	Abbott wants to talk.
CONKLIN	Tell him we're busy.
ZORN	I tried.

CONKLIN	-- and they're sure it's him? --
ZORN	-- he accessed the account --
CONKLIN	-- but it was <u>him</u> --
ZORN	-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --

CONKLIN	What?
ZORN	Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.

CONKLIN	What the fuck is he doing?
ZORN	Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
CONKLIN	It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
ZORN	All of them?

CONKLIN	What?
ZORN	Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
CONKLIN	That'll solve all our problems.

DEPUTY DCM	-- what're you talking about? --
SECURITY CHIEF	-- we're evacuating the building --
DEPUTY DCM	-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
SECURITY CHIEF	-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
DEPUTY DCM	-- you gotta give me more to go on --
SECURITY CHIEF	-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --

GIANCARLO	You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
THE MAN	Where am I?
GIANCARLO	You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
THE MAN	<u>Where am I</u>?
GIANCARLO	You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
THE MAN	How did I get here?
GIANCARLO	You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?

THE MAN	What if it doesn't come back?
GIANCARLO	I told you.  You need to rest.

GIANCARLO	It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
THE MAN	No.

GIANCARLO	Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
THE MAN	I don't remember Zurich.

GIANCARLO	You drink rum?
THE MAN	I don't know.

GIANCARLO	It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
THE MAN	I won't forget this.

AUNT WU	You're back!
YU	How's the arm?  Still sore?
AUNT WU	Much better.  You've been gone so long.
YU	Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
AUNT WU	I'll go and make up his room!

AUNT WU	She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
YU	I didn't have the heart.
AUNT WU	Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

TSAI	Who are you?
BO	Wait!  I'm a friend!

TSAI	I don't care about your sword.
BO	Why were you spying on the Yus?
TSAI	I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
BO	This Jade Fox is a woman?
TSAI	Yes.
BO	Then leave her to me.
TSAI	Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.

LI	Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
FIGURE	I do as I please.

LI	Where's your master?
FIGURE	What's it to you?

FIGURE	Do you think you are a real master?
LI	Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
FIGURE	Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
LI	Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
FIGURE	On guard!
LI	Real sharpness comes without effort.

FIGURE	Go ahead.
LI	Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
FIGURE	Why do you want to teach me?
LI	I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
FIGURE	And if I use them to kill you?
LI	That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

LI	Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
FIGURE IN BLACK	What's it to you?
LI	My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
FIGURE IN BLACK	I'm just playing around.
LI	Tell me, who is your master?
FIGURE IN BLACK	Let's go!

FOX	You're home late... or should I say early?
JEN	Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
FOX	They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
JEN	I'll never live as a thief!
FOX	You're already a thief.
JEN	That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
FOX	Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
JEN	Shut up!
FOX	It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
JEN	I owe you nothing.
FOX	Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.

JEN	You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
FOX	I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
JEN	You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
FOX	If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
JEN	Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
FOX	Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

GANGSTER A	Hello.  What is your name?
JEN	Long.

GANGSTER A	In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
JEN	Don't bother.
GANGSTER A	You don't seem to understand.
JEN	So what if I don't?

GANGSTER A	Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
JEN	He is my defeated foe!

JEN	Please sit.
GOVERNESS	I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
JEN	Put them down.
GOVERNESS	I heard you met Shu Lien today.
JEN	Do you know her?
GOVERNESS	She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

JEN	I'll socialize with whomever I please.
GOVERNESS	Don't invite danger into your father's house.

JEN	I'm tired now.
GOVERNESS	Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
JEN	It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
GOVERNESS	Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.

GOVERNESS	This spells trouble.
JEN	I have a guest.

JEN	It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
YU	The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
JEN	But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
YU	Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
JEN	Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
YU	My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
JEN	Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
YU	You're too young to understand.
JEN	You're a sword fighter too?

YU	Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
JEN	Really?

JEN	It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
YU	Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
JEN	I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
YU	Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
JEN	But you're just like the characters in the stories.
YU	Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
JEN	You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
YU	So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
JEN	You're not married, are you?
YU	What do you think?
JEN	No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
YU	You're probably right.

JEN	I've missed you.
YU	How so?
JEN	I'm bored.

YU	You're doing calligraphy?
JEN	I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

YU	You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
JEN	Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

JEN	Please.
YU	Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
JEN	I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
YU	You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
JEN	Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
YU	Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
JEN	About you and Li Mu Bai?
YU	Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
JEN	No, really?
YU	His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
JEN	Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
YU	I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
JEN	Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
YU	Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

JEN	You say she killed a policeman?
YU	Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,

YU	Here you must be in proper attire.
JEN	I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
YU	I'll give them to you.
JEN	I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

JEN	You, sister...
YU	Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
JEN	They forced me to marry!
YU	Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
JEN	You know about Lo?
YU	He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
JEN	Where is he now?
YU	Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
JEN	You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
YU	How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
JEN	What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?

YU	Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
JEN	Come and get it if you can.
YU	Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
JEN	Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.

YU	You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
JEN	She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.

YU	Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
JEN	Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

LI	Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
JEN	Not another lecture!  On guard!
LI	Let's end this here.
JEN	Only the sword will settle this.

JEN	What do you want?
LI	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
JEN	All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.

JEN	Give it back!
LI	Kneel!
JEN	Never!
LI	Then you have no use for the sword.

JEN	The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
LI	All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.

JEN	Lo?
LO	Jen!

JEN	You shouldn't have come.
LO	With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.

LO	Let's stop a moment.
JEN	Give it back!
LO	You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.

LO	Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
JEN	My comb!

LO	You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
JEN	You coward!
LO	Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?

LO	No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
JEN	It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
LO	Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
JEN	By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
LO	I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
JEN	Give me back my comb.
LO	I don't take orders from anyone.
JEN	Give it back.

LO	When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
JEN	And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

LO	Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
JEN	So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
LO	I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.

LO	Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
JEN	Let them look.
LO	It is trouble for me.

JEN	Don't send me back!
LO	You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

JEN	Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
LO	I will.
JEN	If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.

JEN	Go.
LO	Jen...
JEN	Don't ever come back.

JEN	Do you remember the legend of the young man?
LO	A faithful heart makes wishes come true.
JEN	Make a wish, Lo.

YU	Mu Bai...It's been too long.
LI	It has.  How's business?
YU	Good.  And how are you?
LI	Fine.

YU	Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
LI	Yes.
YU	The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
LI	I left the training early.
YU	Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
LI	During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
YU	You were enlightened?
LI	No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
YU	What was it?
LI	Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
YU	We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
LI	Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

YU	The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
LI	I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
YU	I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
LI	Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
YU	You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
LI	It's time for me to leave it behind.
YU	So what will you do now?

YU	Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
LI	First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
YU	Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
LI	Perhaps.

LI	Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
YU	But something is going on at the Yu household.
LI	What have you discovered?

LI	Jade Fox?  Impossible.
YU	You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
LI	I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
YU	Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
LI	So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
YU	Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
LI	Did you see who posted it?

YU	No.
LI	It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
YU	It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
LI	Have you questioned him yet?
YU	No, not yet...
LI	But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
YU	No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
LI	That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
YU	What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
LI	I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
YU	Then, why did you come?
LI	Well, we had talked...

LI	I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
YU	But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
LI	True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
YU	My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
LI	You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
YU	I knew she would intrigue you.
LI	She needs direction... and training.
YU	She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
LI	That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
YU	But Wudan does not accept women.
LI	For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
YU	It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
LI	I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
YU	I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
LI	Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

YU	You think Jade Fox will show up?
LI	She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.

YU	Don't you want to see her again.
LI	All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.

LI	Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
YU	Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
LI	Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

LI	Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
YU	To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
LI	You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.

LI	We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
YU	What about you?
LI	I'll look around and catch up later.
YU	Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.

YU	What happened?
LI	Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
YU	We followed Jade Fox.

LI	My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
YU	That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?

YU	Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
LI	Shu Lien...
YU	Save your strength.
LI	My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
YU	Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
LI	I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.

MADAM YU	Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
YU	I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
MADAM YU	I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...

YU	We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
MADAM YU	That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
YU	Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
MADAM YU	But don't be too lenient.
YU	No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
MADAM YU	A murderer?
YU	Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
MADAM YU	A female criminal!  Now that's news!

MADAM YU	Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
YU	I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...

TSAI	It's Jade Fox!
MAY	We must avenge mother!

TSAI	You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
MAY	Father!

TSAI	They're gone.
MAY	What does it say?
TSAI	We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill.  Good, the fox is out of her hole.

TSAI	If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
MAY	Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.

SIR TE	This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
YU	Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
SIR TE	All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.

YU	You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
SIR TE	Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
YU	Please, Sir Te, what is it?
SIR TE	Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
YU	I don't know...
SIR TE	Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
YU	I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
SIR TE	When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!

YU	Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
SIR TE	Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
YU	But the sword could be in his compound.
SIR TE	Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.

YU	We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
SIR TE	This is a delicate matter.
YU	Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
SIR TE	What do you have in mind?
YU	The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

ALBRECHT	Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
TORRES	You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
ALBRECHT	This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
TORRES	Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
ALBRECHT	He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
TORRES	Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.

TORRES	And you're gonna tell me who.
ALBRECHT	Who ever made that.

TORRES	What in the hell... do you call that?
ALBRECHT	I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.

ELLY	Talent. Hi.
ALBRECHT	Care for a hot dog?
ELLY	You buying?
ALBRECHT	I'm buying.

ELLY	No onions though, okay?
ALBRECHT	No onions?
ELLY	They make you fart.

ANNABELLA	Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
ALBRECHT	Annie, I need a file.

ANNABELLA	Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
ALBRECHT	This is special, darlin'.  Please?

ANNABELLA	Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
ALBRECHT	Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.

ANNABELLA	Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
ALBRECHT	I knew that.

ALBRECHT	Could be.
ANNABELLA	You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.

ALBRECHT	Well, hello there...chocolate,
ANNABELLA	Don't thank me.
ALBRECHT	Thanks, babe.

ERIC	And I say I'm dead... and I move.
ALBRECHT	No further.  I'm serious.

ALBRECHT	Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
ERIC	You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.

ERIC	Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
ALBRECHT	You don't say.
ERIC	I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
ALBRECHT	Fucking A, my friend.
ERIC	The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.

ALBRECHT	You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
ERIC	I saw it, too.

ALBRECHT	You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
ERIC	I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
ALBRECHT	You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.

ALBRECHT	You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
ERIC	The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.

ERIC	My name.
ALBRECHT	I'm sorry as hell, man.
ERIC	Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...

ERIC	Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
ALBRECHT	I should be trying to stop you.

ERIC	Thank you.  For giving a damn.
ALBRECHT	My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.

ERIC	It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
ERIC	Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
ALBRECHT	Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
ERIC	It's only a flesh wound.
ALBRECHT	It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.

ERIC	I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
ALBRECHT	Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?

ERIC	They couldn't do anything for me.
ALBRECHT	How 'bout the morgue?
ERIC	No.  I have one more thing to do.

ALBRECHT	You sorta looked like you might need my help.
ERIC	This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
ALBRECHT	You're welcome.
ERIC	Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
ALBRECHT	The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.

ERIC	Don't interfere.
ALBRECHT	You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.

ELLY	Mom --?
DARLA	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
ELLY	I lost my key.

DARLA	I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
ELLY	He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
DARLA	We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.

DARLA	At least it finally stopped raining.
ELLY	It can't rain all the time.

FUNBOY	Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
DARLA	Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

FUNBOY	Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
DARLA	Fun -- look at that guy...
FUNBOY	It's just the dope, don't worry
DARLA	Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
FUNBOY	Not me.

ELLY	You look like a rock star without a job.
ERIC	I dabble.  May I?

ELLY	My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
ERIC	Who?
ELLY	Mister Funboy.
ERIC	Mister Funboy lives there?
ELLY	He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.

ERIC	I can pick out a tune now and again.
ELLY	Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
ERIC	Does she have a name?
ELLY	No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.

ELLY	Do you feel okay.
ERIC	No.
ELLY	You gotta go now, I bet.
ERIC	I have to go.

ELLY	What's going on...?
ERIC	A remembrance.  A closure.

ERIC	You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
ELLY	She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
ERIC	Elly...

ELLY	I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
ERIC	I think he's yours, now.

ERIC	Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
ELLY	And she'll be alive.  Up here.

ELLY	Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
ERIC	In a better place.  I hope.
ELLY	You're not gonna come back, are you?

ERIC	I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
ELLY	You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.

MICKEY	What's goin' on, Elly?
ELLY	I went to see a friend of mine.
MICKEY	Well, how's your friend?
ELLY	She's still dead.

MICKEY	Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
ELLY	Mom tried to cook.
MICKEY	Oh.

GRANGE	I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
ELLY	I don't know you.
GRANGE	I'd like to get in touch with him.

ELLY	You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
GRANGE	I'm looking for a good guitar man.
ELLY	Right.

ELLY	You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
GRANGE	I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.

TIN-TIN	Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
ERIC	Murderer.

ERIC	A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
TIN-TIN	Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
ERIC	You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
TIN-TIN	Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.

ERIC	I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
TIN-TIN	I don't know you...

TIN-TIN	Holy shit... you're dead, man...
ERIC	Victims.  Aren't we all.

ERIC	Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
TOP DOLLAR	Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
ERIC	Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR	Take the dope, too.

ERIC	A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
TOP DOLLAR	That's ancient history.
ERIC	It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?

TOP DOLLAR	Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
ERIC	You don't even remember...
TOP DOLLAR	I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
ERIC	Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.

ERIC	Cute nickname, don't you think?
GIDEON	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
ERIC	Wrong answer.

GIDEON	Top Dollar.
ERIC	Another jolly nickname?
GIDEON	You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
ERIC	T-Bird?
GIDEON	Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
ERIC	A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...

LAO	I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
ERIC	I can see her.
LAO	Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

LAO	I wish to possess what you have now.
ERIC	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
LAO	I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

LAO	Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
ERIC	You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
LAO	I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.

ERIC	And how many lives have you destroyed?
LAO	I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.

FUNBOY	How the hell did you do that?
ERIC	Magic.

ERIC	Neither.
FUNBOY	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

FUNBOY	Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
ERIC	Does it hurt?
FUNBOY	Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!

FUNBOY	No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
ERIC	Your pain ends now.

ERIC	What the hell are you?
SKULL COWBOY	Interested?  Follow the crow.

SKULL COWBOY	Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
ERIC	Shelly?
SKULL COWBOY	Miss her?
ERIC	Yes.
SKULL COWBOY	Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.

SKULL COWBOY	Get it?
ERIC	Leave me alone -- !

SKULL COWBOY	Glad to see you're finally with the program.
ERIC	Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
SKULL COWBOY	You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.

SKULL COWBOY	Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
ERIC	Go away.
SKULL COWBOY	You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
ERIC	Shut up.
SKULL COWBOY	Maybe I was wrong about you.

SKULL COWBOY	Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
ERIC	Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.

SKULL COWBOY	Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
ERIC	Fine with me.

SKULL COWBOY	You'll be alone.
ERIC	I'm already alone.

ERIC	Don't waste my time.
SKULL COWBOY	Very well, it's your ass.

GIDEON	Blow yourself, bigmouth.
T-BIRD	Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.

T-BIRD	Coupla more rings... 24k.
GIDEON	18k.  Crap.
T-BIRD	...necklace... pearls...
GIDEON	Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
T-BIRD	Leather purse...

GIDEON	What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
T-BIRD	Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

LAO	Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
GRANGE	No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.

GRANGE	What... the hell is that?
LAO	This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.

GRANGE	That thing is poisonous.
LAO	Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

GRANGE	Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
LAO	I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
GRANGE	Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

LAO	Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
GRANGE	Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
LAO	Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
GRANGE	Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...

LAO	Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
GRANGE	Kill a dead guy?

GRANGE	We've got company.
LAO	Is he inside?

GRANGE	I've got him if you want him.
LAO	No shooting.
GRANGE	Move in, guys.

LAO	An unexpected pleasure.
TOP DOLLAR	Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
LAO	Who got himself what?
TOP DOLLAR	One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
LAO	I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
TOP DOLLAR	I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
LAO	I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
TOP DOLLAR	Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
LAO	To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.

LAO	Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
TOP DOLLAR	Our Crow...?
LAO	Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
TOP DOLLAR	The night is young.

LAO	Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
TOP DOLLAR	Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
LAO	Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.

MCCLANE	I'm John McClane.
ARGYLE	Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.

MCCLANE	Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
ARGYLE	Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
MCCLANE	That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.

ARGYLE	If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
MCCLANE	Married.

ARGYLE	The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
MCCLANE	The past six months.
ARGYLE	Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
MCCLANE	You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
ARGYLE	Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
MCCLANE	It's okay, it's okay.
ARGYLE	So, you divorced of what?

MCCLANE	She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
ARGYLE	But meant her moving here.
MCCLANE	Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
ARGYLE	So, why didn't you come?
MCCLANE	'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
ARGYLE	You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?

MCCLANE	Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
ARGYLE	Mind if I play some tunes?

MCCLANE	How 'bout some Christmas music?
ARGYLE	That is Christmas music.

ARGYLE	So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
MCCLANE	It's corny, but I could live with it.
ARGYLE	What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
MCCLANE	I'll find someplace.

MCCLANE	You're all right, Argyle.
ARGYLE	Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.

BIG JOHNSON	I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
BIG JOHNSON	Not any more.

BIG JOHNSON	One of yours?
ROBINSON	No, sir.
BIG JOHNSON	If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.

ROBINSON	-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
BIG JOHNSON	We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!

ELLIS	What's happening?
HOLLY	They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
ELLIS	The police...?
HOLLY	John.
ELLIS	John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
HOLLY	How about his job?
ELLIS	His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
HOLLY	Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

HOLLY	Where are you going?
ELLIS	I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
HOLLY	What are you going to do?
ELLIS	Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?

ELLIS	John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
MCCLANE	Ellis, what have you told them?
ELLIS	I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.

MCCLANE	Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
ELLIS	Tell me about it.

ELLIS	John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
MCCLANE	Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --

ELLIS	What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
MCCLANE	That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
ELLIS	John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?

ELLIS	Hope I'm not interrupting...?
HANS	What does he want?

HANS	You're very perceptive.
ELLIS	Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
HANS	You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
ELLIS	Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
HANS	I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
ELLIS	The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.

KARL	Nothing...
HANS	See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?

HANS	I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
KARL	He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.



KARL	Hans, he killed by brother --
HANS	Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!

KARL	He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
HANS	He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!

KARL	-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
HANS	If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
KARL	I don't want neutral...I want dead --

KARL	'Asian Dawn Movement?'
HANS	I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.

HANS	It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
TAKAGI	This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.

HANS	Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
TAKAGI	You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
HANS	Who said we were terrorists?

HANS	The code key, please...?
TAKAGI	It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!

TAKAGI	I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
HANS	Okay.

MCCLANE	Bad for your health anyway.
HANS	Who are you, then?
MCCLANE	Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -

HANS	Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
MCCLANE	I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
HANS	I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
MCCLANE	Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
HANS	Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?

HANS	Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
MCCLANE	Go fuck yourself.

HANS	--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
MCCLANE	Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?

HANS	You...you're an American?
MCCLANE	Only if New Jersey counts.

HANS	You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
MCCLANE	I'm a cop from New York.
HANS	New York...
MCCLANE	They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?

MCCLANE	Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
HANS	William Clay.  Call me Bill.

MCCLANE	Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
HANS	One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
MCCLANE	Sounds better than nothing.

MCCLANE	Hans.  Your Hans.
HANS	Put it down now.
MCCLANE	That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
HANS	I'm going to count to three...
MCCLANE	Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.

HANS	Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
MCCLANE	That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
HANS	No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
MCCLANE	Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
HANS	'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.

HANS	Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
THEO	I told you...

HANS	How long?
THEO	Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
HANS	If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.

THEO	Yo!
HANS	We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?

THEO	Three down, four to go --
HANS	Then don't waste time talking to me.

HANS	* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.

HANS	...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
THEO	When you're hot, you're hot.

HANS	Encourage them to be bolder.
THEO	The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.

HOLLY	I...have a request.
HANS	Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
HOLLY	You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.

HANS	Go on.
HOLLY	We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
HANS	No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
HOLLY	Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
HANS	Yes, you're right.  It will be done.

HANS	Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
HOLLY	Gennero.  Miss Gennero.

HOLLY	After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
HANS	I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.

MCCLANE	Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
HOLLY	Sure.  Follow me.

HOLLY	What are you doing?
MCCLANE	It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
HOLLY	That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.

MCCLANE	Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
HOLLY	Oh...Where does he live?
MCCLANE	Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
HOLLY	Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.

MCCLANE	They would, huh?
HOLLY	I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.

MCCLANE	Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
HOLLY	This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
MCCLANE	Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
HOLLY	Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
MCCLANE	No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
HOLLY	My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
MCCLANE	Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
HOLLY	You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.

HOLLY	I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
MCCLANE	Don't I always?

HOLLY	John!
MCCLANE	Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?

MCCLANE	Excuse me, I'm looking for --
TAKAGI	Holly Gennero?
MCCLANE	Yeah.  How'd you know?
MCCLANE	So I've heard.

MCCLANE	Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
TAKAGI	Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
MCCLANE	I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
TAKAGI	Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.

TAKAGI	You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
MCCLANE	Yeah.  I remember our first date.

POWELL	How do you know?
MCCLANE	I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.

POWELL	I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
MCCLANE	I'm ahead of you...partner.
POWELL	Uh, what do I call you?

MCCLANE	'Roy'.
POWELL	Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
MCCLANE	They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.

POWELL	I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
MCCLANE	Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
POWELL	I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.

POWELL	Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
MCCLANE	The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
POWELL	No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
MCCLANE	Two?  Are you sure?

POWELL	Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
MCCLANE	Thanks...partner.

MCCLANE	Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
POWELL	'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
MCCLANE	You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
POWELL	Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?

MCCLANE	Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
POWELL	It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.

MCCLANE	Al?  Al, you there?
POWELL	I'm here, cowboy.
MCCLANE	Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
POWELL	Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
MCCLANE	The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
POWELL	In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

POWELL	Roy?  You still with us?
MCCLANE	Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
POWELL	They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.

MCCLANE	Yeah?  What's the odds?
POWELL	You don't want to know.

MCCLANE	They way you drive, I can see why.
POWELL	I...I shot a kid.

POWELL	Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
MCCLANE	I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
POWELL	Hey, you couldn't know.
MCCLANE	I still feel like shit.
POWELL	Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.

MCCLANE	Powell?  What's going on?
POWELL	Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.

MCCLANE	Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
POWELL	I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
MCCLANE	I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
POWELL	Roy?
MCCLANE	Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.

MCCLANE	Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
POWELL	Bullshit.
MCCLANE	I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.

POWELL	I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
POWELL	The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
ROBINSON	Then who the hell have you been talking too?
POWELL	We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
ROBINSON	He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
POWELL	I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
ROBINSON	How do you know?
POWELL	A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
ROBINSON	-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!

POWELL	What's going on?
ROBINSON	What's it look like?  We're going in.
POWELL	Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
ROBINSON	-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
POWELL	What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
ROBINSON	Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!

ROBINSON	Is that him?
POWELL	Yessir.
ROBINSON	Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --

ROBINSON	Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
POWELL	Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
ROBINSON	Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
POWELL	He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
ROBINSON	Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.

POWELL	This is --
ROBINSON	This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?

ADMIRAL	It was .... the Emperor ....
VADER	The Emperor?
ADMIRAL	Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
VADER	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
ADMIRAL	Yes, My Lord.
VADER	And code the signal to my private chamber.

ADMIRAL PIETT	My lord.
VADER	Come in, Admiral.

ADMIRAL PIETT	Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
VADER	Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
ADMIRAL PIETT	Soon, Lord Vader.
VADER	Yes, Admiral .... soon.

ADMIRAL PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
VADER	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
ADMIRAL PIETT	Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.

BEN	He will learn patience.
YODA	Much anger in him, like in his father.
BEN	We've discussed this before.

BEN	He can do it.
YODA	This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!

BEN	He'll learn.
YODA	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.

YODA	Will he finish what he begins?
BEN	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.

YODA	Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
BEN	You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.

BEN	Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
YODA	Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.

YODA	Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
BEN	The boy is our last hope.
YODA	No ... there is another.

LUKE	I can't ...
BEN	You must.  Luke, look at me!

BEN	You must survive, Luke.
LUKE	I'm cold ... so cold ...
BEN	You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
BEN	Luke ... you are the only hope.

BEN	... Luke, you must not go.
LUKE	But Han and Leia will surely die.
BEN	You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
LUKE	I can help them!
BEN	You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
LUKE	I feel The Force.
BEN	But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.

BEN	Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
LUKE	And that is why I must go.
BEN	Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
LUKE	You won't.
BEN	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.

LANDO	How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
CHEWIE	Growls a reserved greeting.
LANDO	Right.

CHEWIE	Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
LANDO	Everyone's invited, of course.

CHEWIE	Barks a blue streak.
LANDO	What's wrong with him?

LANDO	Three patrol ships are heading our way.
CHEWIE	Barks an argument and shakes his head.

CHEWIE	Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
LANDO	Okay, okay.

CHEWIE	Howls.
LANDO	We're not out of this yet.

HAN	Well, it's been awhile.
CHEWIE	Barks and growls at his boss.
HAN	That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.

CHEWIE	Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
HAN	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?

CHEWIE	Barks at Han.
HAN	Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?

CHEWIE	Barks his concern.
HAN	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.

CHEWIE	Barks a doleful farewell.
HAN	I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.

CHEWIE	Barks at his master.
LEIA	What happened?

LEIA	We should have stayed and finished them off.
CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.

LEIA	I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
CHEWIE	Barks his Òright on!Ó

LEIA	... the power?
CHEWIE	Howls.

CHEWIE	Barks his consternation.
LEIA	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.

LEIA	Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.

LUKE	... Like we're being watched.
CREATURE	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.

LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
CREATURE	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
LUKE	Yeah ...
CREATURE	Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
LUKE	I'm looking for a great warrior.
CREATURE	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.

LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
CREATURE	Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?

LUKE	Give me that!
CREATURE	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.

LUKE	I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
CREATURE	Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

CREATURE	Mine, mine.
LUKE	Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
CREATURE	No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
CREATURE	Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
LUKE	You know the Jedi Master?
CREATURE	Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.

LUKE	... I told you, I'm not hungry.
CREATURE	Patience.  It's time to eat.
LUKE	Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
CREATURE	It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
LUKE	Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
CREATURE	Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
LUKE	Because of my father, I guess.
CREATURE	Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
LUKE	How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?

DECK SERGEANT	Yes sir!
HAN	Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
DECK SERGEANT	I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
HAN	Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!

DECK SERGEANT	Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
HAN	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
DECK SERGEANT	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
HAN	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
DECK SERGEANT	The temperature is dropping too fast.
HAN	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.

DECK SERGEANT	The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
HAN	Then I'll see you in Hell.

VADER	What is thy bidding, My Master?
EMPEROR	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
VADER	I have felt it.
EMPEROR	Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
VADER	Our destruction?  Who?
EMPEROR	The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
VADER	He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
EMPEROR	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
VADER	But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
EMPEROR	Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
VADER	He will join us or die, My Master.

RIEEKAN	Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
HAN	There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
RIEEKAN	Good, and Commander Skywalker?
HAN	He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
HAN	The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.

HAN	That's right.
RIEEKAN	You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
HAN	Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
RIEEKAN	I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.

HAN	Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
RIEEKAN	Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
HAN	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.

THREEPIO	Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
HAN	What is it?
THREEPIO	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
HAN	I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
THREEPIO	She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...

THREEPIO	I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
HAN	Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.

HAN	He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
THREEPIO	I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
HAN	The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.

HAN	Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
THREEPIO	The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.

THREEPIO	Sir, I was wondering ...
HAN	Sit down, and shut up!
THREEPIO	It can wait.

HAN	I think we're in trouble.
THREEPIO	If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
HAN	We're in trouble!

HAN	What are you so grouchy about?
THREEPIO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

HAN	You, too, golden rod.
THREEPIO	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.

THREEPIO	It sounds like it's trying to get in.
HAN	I'm going to see what it is.

THREEPIO	We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
HAN	Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...

THREEPIO	I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
HAN	Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.

HAN	Yes, Your Highness?
LEIA	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
HAN	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
LEIA	Does Luke know?
HAN	He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
LEIA	Han, we need you here.
HAN	We?
LEIA	Yes.
HAN	Not you?
LEIA	Me?  I don't know what you mean.
HAN	You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
LEIA	And what are they, pray tell?
HAN	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA	I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.

HAN	Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
HAN	There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
LEIA	We are fighting for a cause much ...
HAN	Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
LEIA	And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
HAN	Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.

LEIA	Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
HAN	Forget it.

LEIA	Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
HAN	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

HAN	.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
LEIA	What was it?
HAN	Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
HAN	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.

HAN	Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.

LEIA	I don't know what he's talking about.
HAN	Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.

LEIA	You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
HAN	Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?

LEIA	Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?

HAN	Hey!  Someone's still in here.
LEIA	Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.

LEIA	Would it help if I got out and pushed?
HAN	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.

LEIA	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
LEIA	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.

HAN	I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
HAN	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
LEIA	I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.

HAN	That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
LEIA	Or you ran into something ....

HAN	Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
LEIA	Probably an asteroid field ....
HAN	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
LEIA	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
HAN	Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

HAN	Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
LEIA	I take it back.
HAN	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
LEIA	Good.

HAN	But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
LEIA	I'm against that.
HAN	We've got to get out of this shower.
LEIA	Now you're making sense.
HAN	Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...

HAN	There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
LEIA	What is it?
HAN	That should do nicely.

HAN	Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
LEIA	Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
HAN	You don't look angry.
LEIA	How do I look?
HAN	Beautiful.

LEIA	Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
HAN	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
LEIA	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
HAN	Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.

HAN	That was no earthquake.
LEIA	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.

LEIA	They're moving away.
HAN	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
LEIA	Where have I heard that before?

HAN	Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?

HAN	Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
LEIA	Yes, you do.
HAN	You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.

LEIA	Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN	That's quite a compliment.

LEIA	Stop that.
HAN	Why?

HAN	What are you afraid of?
LEIA	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.

LEIA	Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
HAN	Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
LEIA	There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
HAN	You mean a man you can control.
LEIA	I do not!
HAN	Try and control this ...

LEIA	There's something out there!
HAN	Where?
LEIA	Outside, in the cave.

LEIA	Are you crazy!
HAN	Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...

LEIA	Looks like some kind of Mynock.
HAN	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.

LEIA	Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
HAN	Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
LEIA	But the tremors have stopped.

HAN	I see it Chewie, hang on.
LEIA	The entrance is collapsing!

HAN	Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
LEIA	No lightspeed?
HAN	It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!

HAN	Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
LEIA	You're going to attack them?!!!

LEIA	You could have warned him before you shut him off.
HAN	Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
LEIA	I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
HAN	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

LEIA	What'd you have in mind for your next move?
HAN	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.

LEIA	Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
HAN	Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
LEIA	That depends.  Where are we?
HAN	Here ... near the Anoat system.

HAN	Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
LEIA	You keep logs?  My, how organized.
HAN	Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
LEIA	Never heard of that system.
HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
LEIA	A mining colony.
HAN	A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
LEIA	Can you trust him?
HAN	No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...

LEIA	You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
HAN	Let Ôer go, Chewie.

LEIA	I don't like this.
HAN	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.

LEIA	What are you staring at?
HAN	Who's staring?
LEIA	You look silly.
HAN	You look great.
LEIA	Has Threepio turned up yet?
HAN	Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.

LEIA	I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
HAN	Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.

HAN	He found him in a junk pile ...
LEIA	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
HAN	Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
LEIA	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

LEIA	No thanks.
HAN	Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

HAN	I was worried about you.
LEIA	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
HAN	Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.

LEIA	... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
HAN	... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...

HAN	Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
LUKE	I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
LUKE	I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.

HAN	Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
LUKE	Thanks to you.
HAN	That's two you owe me, junior.

LUKE	Probe?  What probe?
HAN	That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.

LUKE	About what?
HAN	Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

LUKE	I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
HAN	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.

LANDO	Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
HAN	No hard feelings?
LANDO	Are you kidding?
HAN	I always said you were a gentleman.
LANDO	I'll bet.

LANDO	That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
HAN	Repairs ...
LANDO	What have you done to my ship?

LANDO	That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
HAN	Hyperdrive.
LANDO	I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.

HAN	How's your mining operation going?
LANDO	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
HAN	Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.

LANDO	Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
HAN	I'm sorry too.

HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO	Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
HAN	This ought to be good.
LANDO	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.

HAN	You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
LANDO	He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
HAN	Luke?  I don't get it.

HAN	All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
LANDO	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

LANDO	Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.

LANDO	What about Leia and the Wookiee?
VADER	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
LANDO	That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
VADER	I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
LANDO	No.
VADER	Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

LANDO	We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
VADER	I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.

LANDO	I'll take what's mine now.
VADER	Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
LANDO	That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
VADER	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

LANDO	Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
LEIA	You may call me Leia.

LANDO	Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
LEIA	Not really.
LANDO	I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
LEIA	Thanks.
LANDO	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?

LANDO	.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
LEIA	You're part of the mining guild then?
LANDO	Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.

LEIA	It's a lovely outpost.
LANDO	Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.

LEIA	What about Han?
LANDO	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
LEIA	... we're the bait.

LEIA	What's going on?
LANDO	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
LEIA	And when do you betray us again?

LANDO	Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
LEIA	We have no use for your kind.
LANDO	This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.

LEIA	Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
LANDO	There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.

LANDO	Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
LEIA	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
LANDO	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
LEIA	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...

LEIA	You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
LANDO	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

LEIA	We've got to find Luke.
LANDO	His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.

LEIA	What'd you say?
LANDO	I didn't say anything?

LANDO	I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
LEIA	Luke!
LANDO	What?
LEIA	Luke needs help.  We must go back.

LEIA	No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
LANDO	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.

LANDO	Someone's falling.
LEIA	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.

LANDO	The deflector shields are gone.
LEIA	Are the coordinates set?

LANDO	I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
LEIA	That sounds familiar.

RIEEKAN	Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
LEIA	I understand.

RIEEKAN	The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
LEIA	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
RIEEKAN	Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...

LEIA	Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
RIEEKAN	Not yet.  They're working on it now.

RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
LEIA	What is it?

LEIA	Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
RIEEKAN	We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.

LEIA	You rest now.
THREEPIO	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
LEIA	I'll be back later.

LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
THREEPIO	If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...

THREEPIO	Closer?!
LEIA	Closer?!

LEIA	A tremor!
THREEPIO	Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.

LEIA	What??
THREEPIO	Oh my, no!

THREEPIO	Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
LEIA	Well, what now?

THREEPIO	Rather touchy, aren't they.
LEIA	I thought you knew this person.

THREEPIO	Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
LEIA	Let's go.

LEIA	The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
LUKE	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
LEIA	Me too.  I was afraid.

LUKE	Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
LEIA	What did you say?!

LEIA	Where are you going?
LUKE	I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
LEIA	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
LUKE	What are you talking about?
LEIA	First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
LUKE	Han's leaving?

LUKE	Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
LEIA	He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
LUKE	Jabba the Hutt?
LEIA	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
LUKE	Snow creatures ... they're here?!

LUKE	Leia!
LEIA	Luke, no!  It's a trap.

LEIA	Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
LUKE	He'll survive.

LEIA	This hyperdrive had better work.
LUKE	I've never seen it fail.

YODA	Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
LUKE	Why not me?
YODA	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

LUKE	I have followed my feelings.
YODA	You are reckless!

LUKE	I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
YODA	You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.

YODA	It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
LUKE	I thought I was in good shape.
YODA	Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.

LUKE	Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
YODA	No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
LUKE	Okay.  I'll give it a try.
YODA	No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
YODA	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?

LUKE	I don't believe it.
YODA	That is why you fail.

YODA	Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
LUKE	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
YODA	That they are.
LUKE	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
YODA	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.

YODA	No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
LUKE	But I feel The Force flowing!
YODA	Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.

LUKE	Price?  What do you mean?
YODA	The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
LUKE	Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
YODA	No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
YODA	You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
LUKE	But tell me why ...
YODA	No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...

YODA	Four this time!  The Force you feel.
LUKE	Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

LUKE	I feel cold.
YODA	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
LUKE	What's in there?
YODA	Only what you take with you.

LUKE	Ben?  Ben?
YODA	Free your mind and return he will.
LUKE	My mind fills with so many images.
YODA	Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
LUKE	I see a city in the clouds.
YODA	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
LUKE	I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
YODA	It is the future you see.

LUKE	Will they die?
YODA	Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!

LUKE	They're my friends.
YODA	Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.

YODA	Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
LUKE	I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA	If it must be.  Yes.

VADER	The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
VADER	And I too.

VADER	Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
LUKE	No!
VADER	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
LUKE	I'll die first.
VADER	That won't be necessary.

VADER	All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
LUKE	Time will tell.

VADER	The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
LUKE	No! .... Never ....

VADER	There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
LUKE	Never.

VADER	The Hoth System?
PIETT	Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

PIETT	Yes, My Lord.
VADER	Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.

PIETT	Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
VADER	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
PIETT	It won't get through the blockade.
VADER	I want that ship.

DOYLE	What's my name?
1ST MAN	Doyle.
DOYLE	What?
1ST MAN	Mr. Doyle.
DOYLE	Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
1ST MAN	What?

DOYLE	What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
2ND MAN	I'm clean.
DOYLE	You don't use shit?
2ND MAN	No. 

DOYLE	Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
2ND MAN	No - no.
DOYLE	Cause if I do.

DOYLE	How's everything?
2ND MAN	Everything is everything.
DOYLE	How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
2ND MAN	There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
DOYLE	I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
2ND MAN	Boca?
DOYLE	B.O.C.A.
2ND MAN	Doesn't register.
DOYLE	Got a wife named Angie.
2ND MAN	No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
DOYLE	What?
2ND MAN	Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
DOYLE	Who brings it?

2ND MAN	Who knows?
DOYLE	Where do you want it?
2ND MAN	This side.

ANGIE	Where are you?
SAL	Takin' care o' business, honey.
ANGIE	Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
SAL	You know I hadda meet some people tonight --

ANGIE	-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
SAL	Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
ANGIE	Well try, okay?
SAL	I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
ANGIE	Sal --
SAL	Yeah?
ANGIE	Don't forget anchovies. 

DOYLE	What's your name, asshole?
BLACK PUSHER	Fuck you, Santa Claus!

BLACK PUSHER	I don't...
DOYLE	Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER	What?
DOYLE	Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
DOYLE	Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER	No... yeah...
DOYLE	Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
BLACK PUSHER	Man, I'm clean.
DOYLE	You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?

CHARNIER	Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
DEVEREAUX	Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.

CHARNIER	Did you pick up the car?
DEVEREAUX	It is waiting for you in the garage.
CHARNIER	Did they follow you?
DEVEREAUX	I wasn't looking.
CHARNIER	Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
DEVEREAUX	My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
CHARNIER	Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.

CHARNIER	Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
DEVEREAUX	Goodbye.

CHARNIER	Allo... Salvatore...
SAL	Who's this --
CHARNIER	... Salvatore?...

CHARNIER	Twelve o'clock... yes...
SAL	Yes --

SAL	Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
CHARNIER	You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
SAL	Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
CHARNIER	Are you having trouble raising the half million?
SAL	Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.

CHARNIER	It has to be by the end of this week.
SAL	Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
CHARNIER	It's your problem.
SAL	It's yours too!

CHARNIER	Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
MARIE	Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
CHARNIER	Si tu veux.

MARIE	Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
CHARNIER	Encore du sho ping!

MARIE	Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
CHARNIER	Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
MARIE	Mais non, c'est pour toi.
CHARNIER	Pour moi?
MARIE	Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
CHARNIER	Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
MARIE	Comment va-t-elle?
CHARNIER	Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.

MARIE	Le sommes nous?
CHARNIER	Non!

MARIE	Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
CHARNIER	Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

CHARNIER	Are you sure it is dead?
MARIE	I'm going to put them on the cat.
CHARNIER	That's a relief.

CHARNIER	Sale boulot.
NICOLI	Il fallait le faire.
CHARNIER	Il est en retard.
NICOLI	Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
CHARNIER	Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
NICOLI	J'ai pas confiance en lui.
CHARNIER	Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.

CHARNIER	I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
NICOLI	What happens to the schedule?
CHARNIER	We must follow it.
NICOLI	But will they?

CHARNIER	I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
NICOLI	He is not wrong.
CHARNIER	Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.

CHARNIER	There'll be someone else.
NICOLI	What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.

CHARNIER	It's beautiful.
LA VALLE	It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
CHARNIER	Who financed it?

CHARNIER	If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
LA VALLE	Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
CHARNIER	Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
LA VALLE	Mmm.

RUSSO	What's your story?
DANCER	Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.

RUSSO	You're in show business.
DANCER	S'right.

RUSSO	All right, get up on that bar and dance.
DANCER	What?
RUSSO	Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
DANCER	You're for real?

DANCER	I got no music!
RUSSO	Fake it.

DESK CLERK	I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
DOYLE	He got off on six.
DESK CLERK	We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.

DESK CLERK	There's nobody like that on six.
DESK CLERK	Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
DOYLE	No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?

DESK CLERK	There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
DOYLE	Names.

DESK CLERK	A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
DOYLE	Where from?
DESK CLERK	Des Moines.
DOYLE	What's he do?
DESK CLERK	Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.

DESK CLERK	Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
DOYLE	Yeh?  Who else?
DESK CLERK	And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
DOYLE	This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
DESK CLERK	I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.

DOYLE	Where's he from?
DESK CLERK	Marseilles.

DESK CLERK	That's in France.
DOYLE	Yeah, I know.

MUTCHIE	What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
DOYLE	Willie Mays.

MUTCHIE	What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
DOYLE	I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
MUTCHIE	They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
DOYLE	You want some eggs.
MUTCHIE	Why not?
DOYLE	Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
MUTCHIE	Yeah!
DOYLE	Where the hell is it?
MUTCHIE	Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?

MUTCHIE	I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
DOYLE	Strike out, eh?
MUTCHIE	Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
DOYLE	A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
MUTCHIE	When ya go back on?
DOYLE	Morning.  Sometime.
MUTCHIE	Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.

MULDERIG	Christ you should o' collared him right there.
DOYLE	Who's on him?

MULDERIG	Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
DOYLE	Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
MULDERIG	Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
DOYLE	Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.

MULDERIG	Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
DOYLE	The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

MULDERIG	That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
DOYLE	Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.

DOYLE	A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
MULDERIG	Nothing in there except a New York street map.
DOYLE	Tumble it.  One end to the other.

RUSSO	Who stuck up the laundromat?
DOYLE	How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

DOYLE	Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
RUSSO	How'd I know he had a knife.
DOYLE	Never trust a nigger.
RUSSO	He coulda been white.

DOYLE	Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
RUSSO	Not a chance.

DOYLE	Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
RUSSO	Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE	Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
RUSSO	Drink this.
DOYLE	Whip it out.

DOYLE	I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
RUSSO	Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

DOYLE	Who is that guy?
RUSSO	Policy man in Queens.
DOYLE	What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO	No, you?
DOYLE	Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
RUSSO	He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.

DOYLE	Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
RUSSO	Give who a tail?
DOYLE	The greaser with the blonde.
RUSSO	What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
DOYLE	Come on -- just for fun --

DOYLE	Monica?  Who's Monica?
RUSSO	A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

DOYLE	If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
RUSSO	Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
DOYLE	Toy wit' this will ya.
RUSSO	There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.

DOYLE	I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
RUSSO	Suspicion of what?
DOYLE	Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

RUSSO	No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
DOYLE	He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.

DOYLE	What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
RUSSO	I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

DOYLE	I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
RUSSO	Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
DOYLE	We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

RUSSO	We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
DOYLE	This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.

RUSSO	Popeye.
DOYLE	Yeah.
RUSSO	It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
DOYLE	I can't.

RUSSO	Why not?
DOYLE	Let yourself in.

RUSSO	What happened to you?
DOYLE	The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.

DOYLE	You got the warrant?
RUSSO	We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.

DOYLE	Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
RUSSO	Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

RUSSO	You want the red or the white?
DOYLE	Pour it in your ear.

DOYLE	The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
RUSSO	The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.

DOYLE	What about Sal?
RUSSO	We put him to bed for the night.

RUSSO	This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
DOYLE	I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

RUSSO	My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
DOYLE	This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.

DOYLE	Timezit?
RUSSO	Four.

DOYLE	Same car.
RUSSO	Third time around.

JESUS	Hey, Bo.
DOYLE	Hiya, Jesus.
JESUS	Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
DOYLE	Whatta you got?

DOYLE	Where'd you get this fag shit?
JESUS	This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
DOYLE	Pass.
JESUS	Forty dollars -- was $250.
DOYLE	Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.

LA VALLE	There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
MARIE	Just for mistakes of parking?

LA VALLE	No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
MARIE	Darling, may I have this one?

LA VALLE	Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
MARIE	Why is it called Hellgate?
LA VALLE	The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.

LA VALLE	I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
MARIE	What is that old building?
LA VALLE	Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
MARIE	What was it?
LA VALLE	It was a crematorium.
MARIE	For garbage?
LA VALLE	For dead bodies.

WEINSTOCK	What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
SAL	Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.

WEINSTOCK	So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
SAL	I been damn careful up to now.
WEINSTOCK	Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
SAL	I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
WEINSTOCK	He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.

DOC	You gotta be kidding.
BEYNON	Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.

DOC	All it takes is a long arm.
BEYNON	Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
DOC	I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
BEYNON	This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...

BEYNON	You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
DOC	I get my own help.
BEYNON	You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.

DOC	What about them?
BEYNON	They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.

BEYNON	Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
DOC	I heard about you. You work with Miller.

DOC	Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
BEYNON	They will be ready. You guys do your job.
DOC	I'll take care of my end.
BEYNON	Stay clean.

BEYNON	Hello, McCoy.
DOC	Beynon.
BEYNON	News said two persons killed.

DOC	Three... Rudy got ambitious.
BEYNON	And you got him...
DOC	That's right.

BEYNON	What about your wife?
DOC	What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.

DOC	You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
BEYNON	They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
DOC	That's your problem.
BEYNON	You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
DOC	No way. I always do my own work.

DOC	I'm in a hurry.
BEYNON	You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
DOC	No applause!

BEYNON	A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
DOC	I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
BEYNON	What do you add up to here?
DOC	One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
BEYNON	A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
DOC	So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
BEYNON	The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
DOC	No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
BEYNON	Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
DOC	I bet.

BEYNON	Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
DOC	Get it over with...

CAROL	We'll try again.
DOC	No way. I've got to get out now.

CAROL	Hello, Doc.
DOC	Hi.
CAROL	You okay?
DOC	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

CAROL	You want to drive?
DOC	My license expired, let's get out of here.
CAROL	Sure...

CAROL	I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
DOC	It looks fine.

CAROL	Feel good?
DOC	Yeah.
CAROL	Where do you want to go?
DOC	I want to take a walk.

DOC	It doesn't look like that.
CAROL	What do you mean? You've never been there.
DOC	I've been there every day for the last four years.

DOC	What's Beynon got set up?
CAROL	Small town, small bank, big money.

DOC	Where did you get those?
CAROL	I've been doing my homework.
DOC	Just like old times?
CAROL	Better than old times.
DOC	I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
CAROL	I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
DOC	Where did you get them developed?
CAROL	Assumed name... Houston.
DOC	Good.

CAROL	Half a million.
DOC	That Beynon's got a long arm.
CAROL	What do you want for dinner?
DOC	Whisky and a peach.

CAROL	How does it taste?
DOC	Just the way I remembered.

DOC	You been okay?
CAROL	Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
DOC	How's Estelle?
CAROL	Fatter... some things never change.
DOC	Boring.
CAROL	Nothing's been boring since you found me.
DOC	That's not all of it.
CAROL	No. It's been a long time.

DOC	You go out much?
CAROL	After four years and now the question comes up.
DOC	Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
CAROL	I'm still here, Doc.

DOC	I guess I'm kind of...
CAROL	It's all right.
DOC	It's just been a while.
CAROL	We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.

DOC	Wait... give me a minute.
CAROL	Sure.

DOC	I'll be okay.
CAROL	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
DOC	Really?
CAROL	Really.

CAROL	How was it?
DOC	Better than I remembered.

CAROL	I was going to fix you breakfast.
DOC	You were asleep.
CAROL	I bought you a lot of new things.

DOC	Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
CAROL	Suit yourself.

CAROL	$250,000 right off the top.
DOC	Is he straight?
CAROL	You got the parole, didn't you?

DOC	Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
CAROL	I couldn't have... much longer.
DOC	Yeah... I know.
CAROL	But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.

DOC	Why are you laughing?
CAROL	I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
DOC	That doesn't hurt.
CAROL	But sometimes I cried a lot too.
DOC	I didn't. I just waited.
CAROL	Want to cry now?

DOC	... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
CAROL	Usually on the right side as you go in.
DOC	Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
CAROL	For exits off Main Street.
DOC	Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.

DOC	Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
CAROL	If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.

CAROL	You know how I feel?
DOC	My mind's not on guessing games.

CAROL	Promise you won't laugh.
DOC	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
CAROL	I feel like the night before the first day of school.
DOC	That bad?

CAROL	It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
DOC	Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
CAROL	You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
DOC	At least you were outside.
CAROL	It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
DOC	Bullshit.
CAROL	I mean it.
DOC	I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
CAROL	We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
DOC	We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
CAROL	... and live happily ever after.

CAROL	What about the bank?
DOC	Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.

CAROL	Doc...
DOC	I see it...

DOC	They checked in.
CAROL	Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
DOC	Why?
CAROL	There are three men dead.
DOC	So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
CAROL	He might be ready to chop us up.
DOC	Do it my way.

DOC	Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
CAROL	I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.

CAROL	Do you trust him?
DOC	I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
CAROL	Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
DOC	If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
CAROL	I don't want to go there.
DOC	Do it my way.

DOC	Why didn't you tell me?
CAROL	There wasn't any way to explain it.
DOC	Yeah.
CAROL	You sent me to him.
DOC	When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
CAROL	What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
DOC	Who's she?
CAROL	She's on TV.
DOC	If you don't start telling the truth... 
CAROL	What do we do?
DOC	We keep going.

CAROL	A man helped me open it...
DOC	And switched keys.
CAROL	He must have.
DOC	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

DOC	How long ago.
CAROL	Fifteen minutes.
DOC	Sure?

DOC	There better be a guy with the
CAROL	You bastard...

DOC	Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
CAROL	I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
DOC	Texas is a big state.
CAROL	I can handle it.
DOC	I'll bet you can.
CAROL	You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?

CAROL	When we had trouble before it was different.
DOC	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
CAROL	What do you want to do?
DOC	Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
CAROL	Do you mean that?
DOC	I mean it.

DOC	We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
CAROL	You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
DOC	When they find it, they find it.

CAROL	You've got it all figured.
DOC	No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
CAROL	Like what?

DOC	There may be a hunting party.
CAROL	Why, there's nothing on the news?
DOC	I didn't mean police.

CAROL	What?
DOC	If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.

CAROL	You're full of ifs.
DOC	I think you liked it with him.

CAROL	Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
DOC	El Paso.

CAROL	That would be the first time.
DOC	When are you going to learn?
CAROL	I did I killed a man.

DOC	From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
CAROL	If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.

DOC	You can't trust anything these days.
CAROL	I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...

DOC	I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
CAROL	You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.

CAROL	Only one car.
DOC	Let's do it.

DOC	Where are you going?
CAROL	El Paso.

DOC	How much?
CAROL	Twenty eight hundred.

DOC	Are you hungry?
CAROL	Not now.

DOC	Okay?
CAROL	I think so... I don't know.

CAROL	No scars?
DOC	No scars.

DOC	Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
CAROL	It's all a game, don't bother me.

DOC	We better stick here till tonight.
CAROL	Yeah.

DOC	We're going to make it.
CAROL	Sure...

DOC	I want to say something.
CAROL	I don't want to hear it.
DOC	Listen to me. It's hard enough.

DOC	Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
CAROL	I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
DOC	We got this far.
CAROL	We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
DOC	I guess you're right.

CAROL	I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
DOC	Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
CAROL	No more about Beynon.
DOC	Whatever happens it's over.

CAROL	Sounds good.
DOC	You want to try with me?
CAROL	Things can't get much worse can they?
DOC	I don't see how.

CAROL	Okay.
DOC	You and me.
CAROL	Can we make it?
DOC	We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
CAROL	That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.

DOC	We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
CAROL	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
DOC	Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
CAROL	Oh, Jesus... how?
DOC	Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
CAROL	I'll be ready.
DOC	Yeah.
CAROL	What's wrong?
DOC	I don't know.
CAROL	Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
DOC	Whatever you say.

CAROL	What is it?
DOC	Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
CAROL	So what?
DOC	If they are not here, he must have sent them away.

CAROL	You're crazy.
DOC	Get your clothes on, move your butt.

DOC	Come on, come on.
CAROL	Who was it?
DOC	Just get your clothes on...

DOC	You okay?
CAROL	Where do we go from here?
DOC	I don't know, airport I guess.
CAROL	They will have our description before we can get a plane.
DOC	Yeah.

CAROL	How long before this car's hot?
DOC	Pull over.

CAROL	Are we going to make it?
DOC	Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
CAROL	Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
DOC	Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
CAROL	I guess we are.

CAROL	What now?
DOC	We walk.

CAROL	That's right.
SOLDIER	Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.

CAROL	Where's home?
SOLDIER	Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
CAROL	No, I'm not.
SOLDIER	Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
CAROL	That certainly makes you kind of special...
SOLDIER	Yeah... I guess it does.

SOLDIER	You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
CAROL	No, I'm afraid not.
SOLDIER	I never have any luck.

CAROL	STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
CAROL	I really hope you have a nice trip.
SOLDIER	Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

SLIM	Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
CAROL	Oh my God.
SLIM	That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.

SLIM	Hope you get to where you're going.
CAROL	Thanks. Hope you do too.
SLIM	By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.

SLIM	One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
CAROL	Tell her you robbed a bank...

SALESMAN	Can I help you?
DOC	Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
SALESMAN	All right. Shells?
DOC	Two boxes of double-ought buck.
SALESMAN	Gonna knock down a wall?
DOC	Might try that.

RUDY	You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
DOC	Where?
RUDY	Chicago.
DOC	You were with him?
RUDY	Yeah. I got out.
DOC	What about you?

DOC	Just in case someone gets a shot off.
RUDY	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
DOC	Suit yourself.
RUDY	Okay. How many bank exits?
DOC	Two.
RUDY	What about the vault?
DOC	Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
RUDY	Wire pull over?
DOC	One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
RUDY	I'm good at that.
DOC	I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
RUDY	Whatever you need.

DOC	I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
RUDY	Aren't we going a little hard?
DOC	What do you have in mind?
RUDY	It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
DOC	Dillinger got killed.

DOC	How's Mama and the kids?
LAUGHLIN	Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
DOC	My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
LAUGHLIN	Just sandwiches...
DOC	Right.

DOC	When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
LAUGHLIN	He took the day off.
DOC	Then you do it.
LAUGHLIN	Can't leave the desk.

DOC	Drive.
SLIM	Suit yourself.

SLIM	How was that?
DOC	Just fine.
SLIM	Where we go in1?
DOC	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
SLIM	Why not?

SLIM	I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
DOC	I kinda doubt it.

DOC	Let's just get to the border.
SLIM	Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.

SLIM	Which way?
DOC	Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
SLIM	Don't you want to go to the airport?
DOC	Not now.

DOC	Listen... how much money did you make this year?
SLIM	What's it to you?
DOC	Come on. How much?
SLIM	'Bout five thousand.
DOC	How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
SLIM	You serious?
DOC	Sure am.
SLIM	And I keep my mouth shut?
DOC	That's what I want.
SLIM	I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
DOC	You got it.
SLIM	How about twenty thousand?

DOC	You're going to have to walk back to the border.
SLIM	Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.

DOC	Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
SLIM	Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
DOC	Go with God.

RUDY	Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
FRAN	Just... tell us what you want.

RUDY	What kind of car do you have, Harold?
FRAN	A Ford... We have a Ford.
RUDY	That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...

FRAN	You do what he says, Harold.
RUDY	After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...

FRAN	I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
RUDY	That right?
FRAN	You can trust him...
RUDY	How long have you been married?
FRAN	Two years.
RUDY	Can he trust you?
FRAN	That's what matters, isn't it?

FRAN	Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
RUDY	I Just want to find a suitcase.

RUDY	What's the damage?
HAROLD	Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
RUDY	I got a nurse in mind.
HAROLD	The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
RUDY	The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
HAROLD	That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.

HAROLD	I've got to stop.
RUDY	I'll tell you when.

ARNOLD	Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
HAMMOND	Stop the program!  Stop the program!

ARNOLD	That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
HAMMOND	You're sure we have to?
ARNOLD	It's not worth taking the chance, John.

ARNOLD	Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
HAMMOND	Damn!

ARNOLD	I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
HAMMOND	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.

ARNOLD	Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
HAMMOND	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
ARNOLD	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.

HAMMOND	What?
ARNOLD	The door security systems are shutting down.
HAMMOND	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?

ARNOLD	Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
HAMMOND	What now?
ARNOLD	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
HAMMOND	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
ARNOLD	The monitors are failing.

ARNOLD	Phones are out too.
HAMMOND	Where did the vehicles stop?

HAMMOND	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
ARNOLD	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
HAMMOND	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
ARNOLD	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.

ELLIE	Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
ARNOLD	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
ELLIE	What one?

ELLIE	How many lines of code are there?
ARNOLD	Uh - - about two million.
ELLIE	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.

ARNOLD	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
ELLIE	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?

ELLIE	But would we get the phones back?
ARNOLD	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -

ARNOLD	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
ELLIE	How would we cut off the lysine?
ARNOLD	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.

ELLIE	How long will this take?
ARNOLD	'Bout thirty seconds.

DODGSON	You shouldn't use my name.
NEDRY	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?

NEDRY	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
DODGSON	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
NEDRY	How am I supposed to transport them?

NEDRY	What?  No menthol?
DODGSON	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
NEDRY	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
DODGSON	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
NEDRY	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.

ELLIE	Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
GENNARO	Shhhhh!

GENNARO	Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
ELLIE	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.

ELLIE	Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
GENNARO	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?

ELLIE	Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
GENNARO	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.

GENNARO	Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
ELLIE	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?

HARDING	Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
ELLIE	Six weeks?

HARDING	Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
ELLIE	These are dilated.  Take a look.
HARDING	They are?  I'll be damned.
ELLIE	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.

HARDING	Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
ELLIE	Are you sure?
HARDING	Pretty sure.
ELLIE	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
HARDING	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.

HARDING	Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
ELLIE	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.

ELLIE	Did I say jerk?
HAMMOND	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?

ELLIE	I have samples all over the kitchen. 
HAMMOND	Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.

HAMMOND	There you are.  Out you come.
ELLIE	Oh my God.
HAMMOND	Could I have a tissue please?

HAMMOND	Fascinating animals, fascinating.
ELLIE	Oh my God.
HAMMOND	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.

ELLIE	Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
HAMMOND	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.

ELLIE	Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
HAMMOND	They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

ELLIE	Carousel.
HAMMOND	A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 

HAMMOND	But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
ELLIE	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
ELLIE	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.

HAMMOND	Once we have control again we - -
ELLIE	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?

HAMMOND	This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
ELLIE	John....

HAMMOND	But you know, I should  really be the one going .
ELLIE	Why?
HAMMOND	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
ELLIE	Look.

ELLIE	Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
HAMMOND	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
ELLIE	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?

GRANT	Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
ELLIE	They died together?
GRANT	The taphonomy sure looks that way.
ELLIE	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.

ELLIE	A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
GRANT	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.

ELLIE	Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
GRANT	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -

ELLIE	You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
GRANT	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
ELLIE	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
GRANT	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
ELLIE	Cheap, cheap, cheap.
GRANT	They smell.
ELLIE	Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
GRANT	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
ELLIE	Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
GRANT	They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
ELLIE	The what?
GRANT	The Cretaceous.
ELLIE	Anything else, you old fossil?
GRANT	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
ELLIE	It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!

ELLIE	Okay, who's the jerk?
GRANT	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
ELLIE	Sattler.

GRANT	And what are those?
ELLIE	Small versions of adults, honey.

ELLIE	Why would they care what we think?
GRANT	What kind of park is it?

GRANT	The movement!
ELLIE	The - - agility.  You're right!

GRANT	Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
ELLIE	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!

ELLIE	You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
GRANT	Say again?

GRANT	Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
ELLIE	We were right!
GRANT	How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!

ELLIE	So what are you thinking?
GRANT	We're out of a job.

GRANT	Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
ELLIE	Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

ELLIE	Oh, shit.
GRANT	Dilophosaurus.

GRANT	Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
ELLIE	It's my favorite.

GRANT	Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
ELLIE	I know.

ELLIE	Constantly sick.
GRANT	Not just every six weeks.
ELLIE	Yeah, I know.

GRANT	Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
ELLIE	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
GRANT	- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -

GRANT	- - like birds - -
ELLIE	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
GRANT	- - a gizzard - -
ELLIE	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
GRANT	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
ELLIE	- - barfs them up - -
GRANT	- - and swallows fresh ones.
ELLIE	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.

GRANT	Are you sure?
ELLIE	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.

GRANT	It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
ELLIE	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.

GRANT	Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
ELLIE	You can't hold it by yourself!
GRANT	Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
ELLIE	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!

MULDOON	They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
ELLIE	The fences are electrified, right?
MULDOON	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.

ELLIE	No, no, no!

MULDOON	Ellie, com one!!
ELLIE	The other car!

MULDOON	Dr. Grant!
ELLIE	Alan!

ELLIE	Do you see anything?
MULDOON	I don't know.

ELLIE	Alan?!
MULDOON	They're not here.

MULDOON	What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
ELLIE	What's that?

ELLIE	I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
MULDOON	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.

MULDOON	I'm going with you.
ELLIE	Okay.

MULDOON	Come on, let's go.
ELLIE	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.

ELLIE	Okay, I'm on channel two.
MULDOON	Stick to my heels.

ELLIE	Oh my God.  Aw, God.
MULDOON	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.

MULDOON	C'mon on, this way.
ELLIE	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!

MULDOON	No. We can't.
ELLIE	Why not?
MULDOON	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.

MULDOON	It's all right.
ELLIE	Like hell it is!

ELLIE	No.
MALCOLM	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!

MALCOLM	That's right.  Will break through.
ELLIE	I get ah - -
MALCOLM	I know, it's very exciting.
ELLIE	And scary.
MALCOLM	And scary.
ELLIE	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
MALCOLM	It's anti-nature.
ELLIE	Anti-nature.

MALCOLM	God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
ELLIE	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.

MALCOLM	You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
ELLIE	I'm still not clear on Chaos.
MALCOLM	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.

ELLIE	Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
MALCOLM	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
ELLIE	Alan, listen to this.
MALCOLM	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
ELLIE	Oh, imperfections?
MALCOLM	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
ELLIE	Unpredictability....
MALCOLM	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.

ELLIE	Alan?
MALCOLM	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
ELLIE	Alan?

MALCOLM	Dino droppings?
ELLIE	Yeah.

ELLIE	Can we chance moving him?
MALCOLM	Please - - chance it.

ELLIE	Faster, faster!
MALCOLM	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
ELLIE	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
MALCOLM	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!

ELLIE	Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
MALCOLM	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 

MALCOLM	Yes?
ELLIE	- - shut up.
MALCOLM	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.

GENNARO	Hola, Juanito
ROSTAGNO	Hola, bienvenido

GENNARO	What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
ROSTAGNO	He sends his apologies.
GENNARO	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
ROSTAGNO	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
GENNARO	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -

ROSTAGNO	Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
GENNARO	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.

GENNARO	If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
ROSTAGNO	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
GENNARO	Why not?
ROSTAGNO	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.

TIM	I can't see.
GENNARO	What are we looking for?
TIM	Dilophosaurus.

TIM	Up and down, up and down!
GENNARO	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
TIM	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -

GENNARO	Hey!  Where did you find those things?
TIM	In a box under my seat.
GENNARO	Are they heavy?
TIM	Yeah.
GENNARO	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.

GENNARO	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
HAMMOND	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
GENNARO	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
HAMMOND	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!

GENNARO	This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
HAMMOND	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

GENNARO	John, we - - what I'm just saying....
HAMMOND	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.

GENNARO	And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
HAMMOND	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
GENNARO	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.

HAMMOND	- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
HAMMOND	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
GENNARO	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?

HAMMOND	I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
GENNARO	Thank you.

HAMMOND	Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
GENNARO	Hey!  Where are the brakes?
HAMMOND	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!

TIM	I read your book.
GRANT	Oh, yeah - - great.

TIM	Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
GRANT	Listen, ahh - -
TIM	Tim.
GRANT	Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
TIM	Whichever one you are.

TIM	And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
GRANT	Really?

TIM	These look kind of familiar.
GRANT	Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.

GRANT	Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
GRANT	Tim, are you okay?
TIM	I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
GRANT	Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.

TIM	I threw up.
GRANT	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.

GRANT	Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
TIM	Yes it is.
GRANT	It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
TIM	No.
GRANT	Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
TIM	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
GRANT	So am I going to help you with your foot?
TIM	What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?

GRANT	'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
TIM	That's a good idea.
GRANT	You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
TIM	I doubt it.
GRANT	Maybe -- it's hard to say.

GRANT	It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
TIM	Thunder lizard!

TIM	Straight-A brainiac!
GRANT	Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -

TIM	What do you call a blind dinosaur?
GRANT	I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
GRANT	You got me.
TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.

GRANT	Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
TIM	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?

GRANT	Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
TIM	It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
GRANT	This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!

GRANT	You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
TIM	But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
GRANT	Amphibian DNA.

GRANT	It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
TIM	Nope.

TIM	I can't!  I'm scared!
GRANT	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.

GRANT	Go, go, go, jump!
TIM	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
GRANT	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!

TIM	Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
GRANT	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..

MALCOLM	So you two dig up dinosaurs?
GRANT	Try to!

GRANT	Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
MALCOLM	Not without massive sequence gaps!

MALCOLM	to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
GRANT	You have no idea.
MALCOLM	to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?

GRANT	You got any kids?
MALCOLM	Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.

GRANT	You're married?
MALCOLM	Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.

MALCOLM	By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
GRANT	Why?
MALCOLM	Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.

GRANT	What'd I touch?!
MALCOLM	You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
GRANT	I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
MALCOLM	Machines hate you?
GRANT	Yeah, they hate me.
MALCOLM	You want to talk about this?
GRANT	No.

GRANT	Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
MALCOLM	The kids okay?
GRANT	Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
MALCOLM	Kids get scared.
GRANT	What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
MALCOLM	I didn't say I was scared.
GRANT	I didn't say you were scared.
MALCOLM	I know.
GRANT	Fine.

GRANT	Where does he think he's going?
MALCOLM	When you gotta go, you gotta go.

GRANT	Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
MALCOLM	You're sure?!
GRANT	Relatively.

MALCOLM	Oh my God!
GRANT	We gotta do something.
MALCOLM	What?  What can we do?
GRANT	There's gotta be something - -

GRANT	Hey, we were saving that!
HAMMOND	For today, I guarantee it.
GRANT	And who in God's name do you think you are....?
HAMMOND	John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.

HAMMOND	Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
GRANT	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
HAMMOND	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
GRANT	What kind of opinions?
HAMMOND	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.

HAMMOND	Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
GRANT	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
HAMMOND	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
GRANT	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
HAMMOND	For a further three years.

GRANT	That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
HAMMOND	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.

GRANT	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
HAMMOND	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.

GRANT	Can't you stop these things?!
HAMMOND	Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
GRANT	Let's get outta here!

GRANT	Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
HAMMOND	Wu?

HAMMOND	Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
GRANT	Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.

HAMMOND	Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
GRANT	Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -

HAMMOND	Ah - - they're here.
GRANT	Who?

HAMMOND	You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
GRANT	What does he mean by "target audience"?

GRANT	Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
HAMMOND	After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.

GRANT	Tim!  Lex!
LEX	Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

LEX	He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
GRANT	Let's get you out.

LEX	Dad - - Dad - -
GRANT	Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
LEX	He left us!  He left us!
GRANT	That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!

LEX	Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
GRANT	I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!

LEX	It's safe?
GRANT	It's safe.
LEX	It's safe.
GRANT	Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
LEX	Alright.

LEX	Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
GRANT	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.

GRANT	Tim, Tim, Tim....
LEX	Oh, I hate the other kind.
GRANT	They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
LEX	Dorkatops!

LEX	What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
GRANT	I guess we'll just have to evolve too.

LEX	What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
GRANT	I'll stay awake.
LEX	All night?
GRANT	All night.

LEX	Go away!
GRANT	It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!

LEX	I like cows.
GRANT	You're a beautiful big animal.

LEX	What's that?
GRANT	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!

GRANT	Watch how it eats!
LEX	Please!
GRANT	Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!

LEX	Let's go!
GRANT	Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.

GRANT	C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
LEX	Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!

LEX	Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
GRANT	Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
LEX	Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!

GRANT	Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
LEX	You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
GRANT	It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
LEX	Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
GRANT	I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!

GRANT	I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
LEX	Yes.

GRANT	What works?
LEX	Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!

HAMMOND	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
MALCOLM	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!

MALCOLM	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
HAMMOND	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
MALCOLM	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!

HAMMOND	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
MALCOLM	John, John.
HAMMOND	Don't do that!
MALCOLM	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?

HAMMOND	Your silence intrigues me.
MALCOLM	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.

HAMMOND	Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
MALCOLM	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.

HAMMOND	You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
MALCOLM	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
HAMMOND	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
MALCOLM	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
HAMMOND	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
MALCOLM	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!

HAMMOND	I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
MALCOLM	You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.

HAMMOND	That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
MALCOLM	Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!

NEDRY	I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
HAMMOND	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
NEDRY	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
HAMMOND	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
NEDRY	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
HAMMOND	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
NEDRY	Thanks, Dad.

HAMMOND	Why didn't I build in Orlando?
MULDOON	I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
HAMMOND	Ray, start the tour program.

MULDOON	Sustain winds 45 knots.
HAMMOND	Tell them when they get back to the cars.
MULDOON	Thanks, Steve.

HAMMOND	Well?
MULDOON	There's no sign of him anywhere.

HAMMOND	Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
MULDOON	Sure.

LEX	We miss you.
TIM	Thanks for the presents.
LEX	We love the presents.

LEX	What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
TIM	Excellent.

LEX	I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
TIM	Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!

LEX	I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
TIM	Why did you do this?
LEX	I don't know!  I'm sorry!

LEX	Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
TIM	What if we fall?  I hate trees.

TIM	I hate trees!
LEX	They don't bother me.
TIM	Yeah, you weren't in that last one.

LEX	No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
LEX	They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
TIM	That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.

LEX	I'm a hacker!
TIM	That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!

TIM	Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
LEX	What?
TIM	Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.

LEX	That's not funny.
TIM	That was great!

LEX	Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
TIM	I'm afraid I am gonna fall!

LEX	You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
TIM	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

CRAIG	Captain Doyle?
DOYLE	Yeah?

DOYLE	What can I do for you?
CRAIG	Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
DOYLE	Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.

CRAIG	We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
DOYLE	We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
CRAIG	I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
DOYLE	Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
CRAIG	Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
DOYLE	If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
CRAIG	That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.

CRAIG	I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
DOYLE	Cooperate?
CRAIG	Every step of the way.
DOYLE	If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.

DOYLE	Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
CRAIG	Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.

CRAIG	You mind if I ride with you?
DOYLE	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.

MARVOSA	It's Marvosa -
D.T.	What do you need?
MARVOSA	The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.

MARVOSA	He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
D.T.	So what?
MARVOSA	So what is they have enough to shut us down!
D.T.	You mean shut your ass down!
MARVOSA	No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!

D.T.	Yeah?
MARVOSA	Where are you?
D.T.	We're by Ozone...
MARVOSA	You set to go -
D.T.	What do you think?
MARVOSA	Alright, stay on the phone.

MARVOSA	Bullshit...
DOYLE	Did you report it stolen?

MARVOSA	You can cut the shit, asshole--
DOYLE	we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!

DOYLE	What the hell happened?
MARVOSA	He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
DOYLE	Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
MARVOSA	It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!

DOYLE	I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
MARVOSA	Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--

DOYLE	What the hell is this Marvosa!!
MARVOSA	He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
DOYLE	Great. Well that changes a lot...

MARVOSA	I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
DOYLE	We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -

DOYLE	Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
MARVOSA	Don't worry -

MARVOSA	Did you hit him?
DOYLE	I didn't hit shit!

MARVOSA	What did the six-toes have to say?
DOYLE	Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
MARVOSA	So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
DOYLE	But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
MARVOSA	I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...

DOYLE	Find out for me.
MARVOSA	Fine...

DOYLE	Let's roll -
MARVOSA	Right behind you.

DOYLE	If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
MARVOSA	These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
DOYLE	I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.

MARVOSA	I'll take the south end -
DOYLE	Fine -

MARVOSA	What's this?
DOYLE	Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?

MARVOSA	What?
DOYLE	When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
MARVOSA	Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
DOYLE	Did you start out area six?
MARVOSA	Yeah...

DOYLE	So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
MARVOSA	Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
DOYLE	Well don't you think that's odd?
MARVOSA	What?

DOYLE	It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
MARVOSA	Gotta come from somewhere...
DOYLE	Where do you come from, Marvosa?

DOYLE	Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
MARVOSA	Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.

MARVOSA	Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
DOYLE	That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?

DOYLE	Something wrong with you Marvosa?
MARVOSA	It's just...catching up with me, you know?
DOYLE	Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

DOYLE	Alright, where is she?
JIM	And who are you?
DOYLE	Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
JIM	I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.

JIM	She stole my car!!

DOYLE	So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
JIM	I didn't break in - the back door was open!
DOYLE	Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!

DOYLE	Are you alright?
JIM	I'll live...

DOYLE	I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
JIM	It wasn't in the cards.

LURCH	The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
DOYLE	And he took a swing at you?
LURCH	Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
DOYLE	Did he harm the girl?
LURCH	Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
DOYLE	Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.

DOYLE	Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
LURCH	Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?

LURCH	I was just having a little fun -
DOYLE	And what did he do to the girl?
LURCH	Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!

DOYLE	Zydowski.  It's about time.
ZYDOWSKI	You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
DOYLE	Yeah?
ZYDOWSKI	Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
DOYLE	What?  Wait a minute -
ZYDOWSKI	That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
DOYLE	That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...

ZYDOWSKI	Did you read today's paper?
DOYLE	No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
ZYDOWSKI	Well read this -

DOYLE	Something I don't already know?
ZYDOWSKI	Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?

DOYLE	Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
ZYDOWSKI	Could explain why Fleming was there.

DOYLE	And where the hell is Marvosa?
ZYDOWSKI	He said he was following up some lead.
DOYLE	Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...

OFFICER	Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
DOYLE	Who is it?
OFFICER	I don't know - but he's from the FBI.

DOYLE	Where is he?!!
OFFICER	I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!

DOYLE	Speak of the devil.
OFFICER	They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
DOYLE	Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?

OFFICER	Captain?
DOYLE	Yeah?
OFFICER	LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.

STEPHANIE	So where are you from?
JIM	Up north.
STEPHANIE	Where up north?
JIM	Seattle.
STEPHANIE	You got any family?

JIM	No...
STEPHANIE	You're the mysterious type, right?

STEPHANIE	Mind if I turn out the light?
JIM	No...

STEPHANIE	You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
JIM	Figure you would have tried it already.

JIM	You always carry a gun with you?
STEPHANIE	No.
JIM	Only on dates?

JIM	What's going on here?
STEPHANIE	You'll find out - soon enough.

JIM	Why did you set me up?
STEPHANIE	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
JIM	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
STEPHANIE	I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
JIM	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
STEPHANIE	No.  A witness.
JIM	What exactly did you see?
STEPHANIE	Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
JIM	No, but I'm listening.
STEPHANIE	I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
JIM	Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
STEPHANIE	Yeah...they did.  One girl...

JIM	And what did you do?
JIM	Found what?

STEPHANIE	I had it all on tape...
JIM	What did you do then?
STEPHANIE	I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
JIM	What happened with the tape?
STEPHANIE	I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
JIM	So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.

JIM	There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE	Yeah.
JIM	Where the hell is my car?

STEPHANIE	Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
JIM	No -
STEPHANIE	Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...

TUBBS	What?
JIM	Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!

JIM	Tubbs, it's me.
TUBBS	Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
JIM	No...I'm in some trouble...
TUBBS	Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
JIM	Yeah...

TUBBS	You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
JIM	Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
TUBBS	Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
JIM	It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
TUBBS	Jesus, man...
JIM	Please...

JIM	Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
TUBBS	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--

TUBBS	Holy shit -
JIM	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
TUBBS	Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!

JIM	No...
TUBBS	Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!

TUBBS	And?...
JIM	I killed them.
TUBBS	Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
JIM	Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!

TUBBS	Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
JIM	It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
TUBBS	You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
JIM	They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
TUBBS	Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
JIM	I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!

TUBBS	Oh man...what happened?
JIM	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
TUBBS	Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?

JIM	I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
TUBBS	Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?

JIM	I've got a better idea...
TUBBS	OK...where do you want to start?

TUBBS	OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
JIM	1490...Breckinridge...
TUBBS	Let's see what we got...

TUBBS	Donut?
JIM	No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
TUBBS	I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
JIM	I knew I could count on you.
TUBBS	I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?

JIM	OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
JIM	How about Marvosa and the others?
TUBBS	I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -

TUBBS	So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
JIM	I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.

TUBBS	You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
JIM	What else is new?

TUBBS	OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
JIM	A bank?
TUBBS	Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
JIM	Both at the same bank...
TUBBS	And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...

TUBBS	Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
JIM	It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
TUBBS	Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.

JIM	That was her - the girl... We have to go.
TUBBS	I'm not going anywhere!
JIM	Tubbs, these people mean business.
TUBBS	I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.

TUBBS	I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
JIM	I'm going to need a way to get there.

JIM	Are you going to be alright?
TUBBS	Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.

WOMAN	Where are you going?
JIM	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
WOMAN	You must be going somewhere.
JIM	I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
WOMAN	Mind if I come along for the ride?

WOMAN	I'm stranded out here.
JIM	Hop in.

WOMAN	Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
WOMAN	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
JIM	Are you a regular there?
WOMAN	Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
JIM	Ditched you?
WOMAN	We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
JIM	Bartender said there are motels south of here.

JIM	What would your - boyfriend - think?
WOMAN	Screw him!

JIM	You don't seem afraid of much.
WOMAN	Not with this...

JIM	No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
MARVOSA	Did you have sex with her?
JIM	What?
MARVOSA	Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
JIM	No.  It wasn't like that!
MARVOSA	Then what did you do, play canasta?

JIM	Where am I going?
MARVOSA	County jail - get in.

TUBBS	Don't you guys ever knock?
MARVOSA	Where is he?
TUBBS	Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?

MARVOSA	Long gone, huh?
TUBBS	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
MARVOSA	Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
TUBBS	Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
MARVOSA	Nahhh...

AGENT JONES	Then the informant is real.
AGENT SMITH	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
AGENT JONES	He'll be contacting us again.
AGENT SMITH	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
AGENT JONES	Their next target.  The name is Neo.

AGENT SMITH	We'll need a search running.
AGENT JONES	It's already begun.

AGENT JONES	They are dead.  In either case --
AGENT SMITH	We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.

AGENT JONES	You don't know.
AGENT SMITH	Know what?

AGENT SMITH	The sewers.  Of course.
MORPHEUS	Hurry!
AGENT SMITH	They won't make it.

AGENT SMITH	The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
MORPHEUS	And you are?
AGENT SMITH	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
MORPHEUS	You all look the same to me.

AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT	Oh shit.
AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
LIEUTENANT	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
AGENT SMITH	The orders were for your protection.

LIEUTENANT	I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
AGENT SMITH	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

SWITCH	He's gonna make it.
APOC	No way.  Not possible.

SWITCH	Weird.
APOC	What?
SWITCH	That's the third white van I've seen.
APOC	Should Tank I.D. it?

APOC	What?!
SWITCH	Oh, God.

NEO	Who is it?
CHOI	It's Choi.

NEO	You're two hours late.
CHOI	I know.  It's her fault.

NEO	You got the money?
CHOI	Two grand.

CHOI	Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
NEO	If you get caught using that --
CHOI	I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
NEO	Right...

CHOI	Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
NEO	I don't know... My computer...

NEO	You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
CHOI	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

CYPHER	You weren't supposed to relieve me.
TRINITY	I know but I felt like taking a shift.

TRINITY	Don't be ridiculous.
CYPHER	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
TRINITY	Morpheus believes he is the One.

CYPHER	Do you?
TRINITY	I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
CYPHER	You don't, do you?
TRINITY	If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
CYPHER	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.

TRINITY	Did you hear that?
CYPHER	Hear what?

TRINITY	Are you sure this line is clean?
CYPHER	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

CYPHER	There's something about him, isn't there?
TRINITY	Don't tell me you're a believer now?
CYPHER	I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
TRINITY	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

CYPHER	Hello, Trinity.
TRINITY	Cypher?  Where's Tank?
CYPHER	He had an accident.
TRINITY	An accident?!

CYPHER	You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
TRINITY	You killed them.

CYPHER	I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
TRINITY	My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
CYPHER	Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
TRINITY	The Matrix isn't real!
CYPHER	Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.

TRINITY	But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
CYPHER	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.

TRINITY	Goddamn you, Cypher!
CYPHER	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.

TRINITY	... yes.
CYPHER	No!

NEO	I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
CYPHER	He's going to pop!

CYPHER	Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
NEO	Sorry.
CYPHER	No, it's all right.
NEO	What are you doing?
CYPHER	Midnight watch.

NEO	Is that...?
CYPHER	The Matrix?  Yeah.

NEO	Do you always look at it encoded?
CYPHER	Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?

CYPHER	Why you're here?
NEO	... Yeah.
CYPHER	Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?

CYPHER	I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
NEO	Really?
CYPHER	You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
NEO	How many were there?
CYPHER	Five.  Since I've been here.
NEO	What happened to them?
CYPHER	Dead.  All dead.
NEO	How?
CYPHER	Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.

NEO	Thanks... for the drink.
CYPHER	Any time.

TANK	Operator.
CYPHER	I need an exit!  Fast!
TANK	Cypher?

CYPHER	There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
TANK	I got you.
CYPHER	Just get me outta here.
TANK	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.

MORPHEUS	I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
TRINITY	Are they any agent?
MORPHEUS	Yes.
TRINITY	Goddamnit!
MORPHEUS	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.

TRINITY	All right --
MORPHEUS	Go.

TRINITY	I got a fibrillation!
MORPHEUS	Shit!  Apoc?

MORPHEUS	We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
TRINITY	What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?

MORPHEUS	Give me your phone.
TRINITY	They'll be able to track it.
MORPHEUS	We have no choice.

TRINITY	What is he doing?
MORPHEUS	He's beginning to believe.

TRINITY	How long?
MORPHEUS	Five minutes.  Maybe six.

TRINITY	You can't use that until Neo is out!
MORPHEUS	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.

NEO	Hello?
MORPHEUS	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?

NEO	Morpheus...
MORPHEUS	I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
NEO	Who's coming for me?
MORPHEUS	Stand up and see for yourself.
NEO	Right now?
MORPHEUS	Yes.  Now.

NEO	Holy fucking shit!
MORPHEUS	Yes.

NEO	What the fuck do they want with me?!
MORPHEUS	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
NEO	How?!
MORPHEUS	I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.

MORPHEUS	The cubicle across from you is empty.
NEO	But what if...?
MORPHEUS	Go!  Now!

MORPHEUS	Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
NEO	How do you know all this?

NEO	No!  It's too far away.
MORPHEUS	There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.

NEO	No way, no way, this is crazy.
MORPHEUS	There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.

MORPHEUS	This line is tapped so I must be brief.
NEO	The agents --
MORPHEUS	They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
NEO	What do you know?
MORPHEUS	You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.

MORPHEUS	Do you still want to meet?
NEO	... Yes.
MORPHEUS	Go the the Adams Street bridge.

MORPHEUS	Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
NEO	It's an honor.
MORPHEUS	Please.  Come.  Sit.

MORPHEUS	I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
NEO	You could say that.
MORPHEUS	I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.

MORPHEUS	Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
NEO	You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
MORPHEUS	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
NEO	No.
MORPHEUS	Why not?
NEO	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
MORPHEUS	I know exactly what you mean.

MORPHEUS	Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
NEO	The Matrix?
MORPHEUS	Do you want to know what it is?

MORPHEUS	The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
NEO	What truth?
MORPHEUS	That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.

MORPHEUS	The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
NEO	What does that mean?

MORPHEUS	Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
NEO	This can't be...
MORPHEUS	Be what?  Be real?

NEO	... am I dead?
MORPHEUS	Far from it.

NEO	What are you doing?
MORPHEUS	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.

NEO	Why do my eyes hurt?
MORPHEUS	You've never used them before.

NEO	Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
MORPHEUS	More important than what is when?
NEO	When?
MORPHEUS	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.

NEO	Right now, we're inside a computer program?
MORPHEUS	Wild, isn't it?

NEO	This isn't real?
MORPHEUS	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

MORPHEUS	We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
NEO	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
MORPHEUS	Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.

NEO	No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
MORPHEUS	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.

MORPHEUS	Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
NEO	For what?
MORPHEUS	Your training.

NEO	This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
MORPHEUS	Show me.

MORPHEUS	How did I beat you?
NEO	You -- you're too fast.
MORPHEUS	Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

NEO	I know what you're trying to do --
MORPHEUS	I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.

MORPHEUS	Do you know why you didn't make it?
NEO	Because... I didn't think I would?

NEO	I thought it wasn't real.
MORPHEUS	Your mind makes it real.

NEO	If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
MORPHEUS	The body cannot live without the mind.

MORPHEUS	This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
NEO	What -- what lesson?

MORPHEUS	Do you understand, Neo?
NEO	I think I do.
MORPHEUS	No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
NEO	Yeah.
MORPHEUS	Look again.

MORPHEUS	Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
NEO	How?
MORPHEUS	I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

NEO	What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
MORPHEUS	No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

MORPHEUS	Set down in there.
NEO	What's going on?

NEO	So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
MORPHEUS	Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
NEO	The beginning?
MORPHEUS	Of the Resistance.
NEO	And she knows what?  Everything?
MORPHEUS	She would say she knows enough.
NEO	How does she know?
MORPHEUS	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
NEO	And she's never wrong.
MORPHEUS	Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
NEO	She helped you?
MORPHEUS	Yes.
NEO	What did she tell you?
MORPHEUS	That I would find the One.

NEO	Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
MORPHEUS	Why?
NEO	I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
MORPHEUS	What do you believe in?
NEO	What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
MORPHEUS	That's why we're here.
NEO	Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
MORPHEUS	Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
NEO	And you still believe I'm the One?
MORPHEUS	Yes I do.
NEO	Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?

NEO	Did you believe in them too?
MORPHEUS	No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.

MORPHEUS	Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
NEO	Morpheus, I don't know --
MORPHEUS	I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.

NEO	No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
MORPHEUS	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!

NEO	Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
MORPHEUS	She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

MORPHEUS	How is he?
TANK	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.

TANK	Got it.
MORPHEUS	I need the main wet-wall.

TANK	Now left and that's it in front of you.
MORPHEUS	Good.

MORPHEUS	Tank.
TANK	Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
MORPHEUS	We need an exit.
TANK	Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
MORPHEUS	We're on our way --

MORPHEUS	Tank, charge the E.M.P.
TANK	Yes, sir.

TANK	I'm going to make the call.
MORPHEUS	Do it!

TANK	How...?!
MORPHEUS	He is the One.  He is the One!

NEO	Hello?
ORACLE	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
NEO	You're the Oracle?
ORACLE	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
NEO	Yeah.
ORACLE	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
NEO	What vase?

ORACLE	That vase.
NEO	Shit, I'm sorry.

ORACLE	I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
NEO	How did you know...?

ORACLE	You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
NEO	Who?
ORACLE	Not too bright though.

ORACLE	So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
NEO	Honestly?  I don't know.

ORACLE	Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
NEO	But what?
ORACLE	But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
NEO	I'm not the One.
ORACLE	Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
NEO	What?
ORACLE	Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.

ORACLE	What's funny?
NEO	Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
ORACLE	I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
NEO	What do you mean, without him?

ORACLE	Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
NEO	What?
ORACLE	You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.

TRINITY	Hello, Neo.
NEO	How do you know that name?
TRINITY	I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
NEO	Who are you?
TRINITY	My name is Trinity.
NEO	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
TRINITY	That was a long time ago.
NEO	Gee-zus.
TRINITY	What?
NEO	I just thought... you were a guy.
TRINITY	Most guys do.

NEO	Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
TRINITY	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.

NEO	How did you do that?
TRINITY	Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
NEO	Of what?
TRINITY	They're watching you, Neo.
NEO	Who is?
TRINITY	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

TRINITY	It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
NEO	What is the Matrix?
TRINITY	When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.

NEO	What the hell is this?!
TRINITY	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
NEO	From what?
TRINITY	From you.

TRINITY	Neo, please, you have to trust me.
NEO	Why?
TRINITY	Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.

TRINITY	And I know that's not where you want to be.
NEO	... shit.

NEO	What is this thing?
TRINITY	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.

NEO	Uh-oh...
TRINITY	It's going into replication.

NEO	Get this thing out of me!
TRINITY	Easy, Neo.  Easy.

NEO	E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
TRINITY	It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

NEO	God...
TRINITY	What?
NEO	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.

NEO	What does that mean?
TRINITY	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
NEO	But an Oracle can.
TRINITY	That's different.
NEO	Is it?
TRINITY	Are you worried?
NEO	Should I be?
TRINITY	No.

NEO	Did you go to her?
TRINITY	Yes.
NEO	What did she tell you?
TRINITY	She told me...

TRINITY	Are you all right?
NEO	... right as rain.

TRINITY	What did you just say?
NEO	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
TRINITY	What happened?  What did you see?
NEO	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
TRINITY	How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
NEO	It might have been.  I'm not sure.

NEO	What is it?
TRINITY	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.

TRINITY	Go!
NEO	We can't leave him!
TRINITY	We have to!

NEO	Is Morpheus alive?
TRINITY	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?

TRINITY	What happened?
NEO	I don't know.  It just went dead.

TRINITY	Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
NEO	There has to be something that we can do.

NEO	That I would have to make a choice...
TRINITY	What choice?

TRINITY	What are you doing?
NEO	I'm going in after him.
TRINITY	You can't!
NEO	I have to.
TRINITY	Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
NEO	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
TRINITY	What?
NEO	I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.

TRINITY	No, you... have to be.
NEO	I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
TRINITY	No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
NEO	Why?
TRINITY	Because...

TRINITY	What?
NEO	I believe I can bring him back.

NEO	What are you doing?
TRINITY	I'm coming with you.
NEO	No, you're not.
TRINITY	No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.

TRINITY	No one has ever done anything like this.
NEO	Yeah?

TRINITY	Neo, how did you do that?
NEO	Do what?
TRINITY	You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
NEO	It wasn't fast enough.

TRINITY	Are you all right?
NEO	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.

NEO	Can you fly that thing.
TRINITY	Not yet.

TANK	Morning.  Did you sleep?
NEO	No.
TANK	You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

NEO	You don't have...
TANK	Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
NEO	Zion?
TANK	If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
NEO	It's a city?
TANK	The last human city.  The only place we got left.
NEO	Where is it?
TANK	Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.

NEO	Holy shit!
TANK	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
NEO	Hell yes!

NEO	See who?
TANK	The Oracle.

NEO	What are they doing to him?
TANK	They're hacking his mind.
NEO	How?
TANK	They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
NEO	How much time?
TANK	Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.

TANK	When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
NEO	What do they want?
TANK	Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.

NEO	Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
TANK	Neo, this has to be done!
NEO	Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
TANK	What are you talking about?
NEO	The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...

TANK	Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
NEO	I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
TANK	Why?
NEO	Because I believe in something.

TANK	Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
NEO	Guns.  Lots of guns.

TANK	Operator.
NEO	Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!

NEO	Which way?  Which way?
TANK	Duck!

NEO	It's locked.
TANK	Kick it in!  Kick it in!

TANK	Operator.
TRINITY	Tank, it's me.

TANK	Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
TRINITY	He's alive.

TRINITY	We need an exit!
TANK	You're not far from Cypher.
TRINITY	Cypher, I thought --
TANK	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
TRINITY	Got it.

TRINITY	Tank, you're hurt.
TANK	I'll be all right.
TRINITY	Dozer?

TANK	There is.  We have to pull the plug.
TRINITY	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
TANK	Trinity, we don't have any other choice.

TANK	Operator.
TRINITY	Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.

TRINITY	Neo!
TANK	What the hell just happened?
TRINITY	An Agent!  You have to send me back!
TANK	I can't!

TRINITY	What just happened?
TANK	I don't know.  I lost him.

TANK	They've burned through the outer shields.
TRINITY	Hurry, Neo.

MOLLY	Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
3JANE	I'm fine.

MOLLY	Let me get you another glass of wine.
3JANE	I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
MOLLY	They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
3JANE	Of course.

3JANE	Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
MOLLY	No. I only needed the code from you.
3JANE	Then we would have talked, you and I.

MOLLY	Take this off.
3JANE	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
MOLLY	Don't play with me.

3JANE	You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
MOLLY	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
3JANE	Pity. Then you'll both have to die.

3JANE	She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
RIVIERA	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

3JANE	Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
RIVIERA	Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.

3JANE	You're hurt...
RIVIERA	It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
3JANE	What about her?
RIVIERA	Of course...

CASE	What are you doing in here?
AEROL	The Elders, mon...

CASE	Can you get us into Straylight?
AEROL	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
CASE	If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.

CASE	I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
AEROL	Straylight. Kitchen dock.

CASE	What the hell is that?
AEROL	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.

AEROL	What you lookin' for, mon?
CASE	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.

AEROL	Ghost a steppin' razor...
CASE	No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.

MOLLY	Easy...
ARMITAGE	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.

MOLLY	What's an A.I.
ARMITAGE	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.

MOLLY	A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
ARMITAGE	He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.

MOLLY	We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
ARMITAGE	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.

ARMITAGE	The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
MOLLY	How's the villa's security?
ARMITAGE	Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.

ARMITAGE	Alright. Let's talk business.
RIVIERA	Why not?

ARMITAGE	Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
RIVIERA	I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
ARMITAGE	You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.

ARMITAGE	Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
RIVIERA	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
ARMITAGE	What?

ARMITAGE	Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
RIVIERA	And how do you suggest I do that?

ARMITAGE	Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
CASE	You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
ARMITAGE	Very well.

ARMITAGE	The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
CASE	What does this have to do with me?
ARMITAGE	Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
CASE	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
ARMITAGE	Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.

ARMITAGE	If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
CASE	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
ARMITAGE	What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
CASE	I'd say you were full of shit.

CASE	Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
ARMITAGE	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
CASE	It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
ARMITAGE	We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
CASE	Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
ARMITAGE	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.

ARMITAGE	I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
CASE	I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
ARMITAGE	You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
CASE	Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
ARMITAGE	Good, because you've got a new one.

ARMITAGE	There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
CASE	You son of a bitch...

CASE	Why'd you do it, Armitage?
ARMITAGE	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
CASE	Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.

CASE	First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
ARMITAGE	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
CASE	Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
ARMITAGE	It hasn't yet.

CASE	I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
ARMITAGE	Dixie McCoy
CASE	Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
ARMITAGE	I've arranged for him to work with us.
CASE	That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
ARMITAGE	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
CASE	What are you talking about?
ARMITAGE	Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.

CASE	Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
ARMITAGE	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
CASE	And then?
ARMITAGE	Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
CASE	It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.

ARMITAGE	You ran without us.
CASE	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
ARMITAGE	Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
CASE	What's he doing to my gear?

ARMITAGE	What's this?
CASE	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
ARMITAGE	Did you trace it?
CASE	No, but it traced me.

CASE	Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
ARMITAGE	What about McCoy?
CASE	He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
ARMITAGE	Prepping your trip.
CASE	Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
ARMITAGE	Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
CASE	That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
ARMITAGE	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
CASE	Linked?

CASE	Yeah, well it's working.
ARMITAGE	Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.

CASE	Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
ARMITAGE	You see the couple up in the balcony?

ARMITAGE	That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
CASE	He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
ARMITAGE	Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
CASE	The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
ARMITAGE	Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.

CASE	That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
ARMITAGE	We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.

CASE	Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
ARMITAGE	Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
CASE	As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
ARMITAGE	What are you talking about?
CASE	The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.

ARMITAGE	You've got your orders.
CASE	This ain't Bangkok, chief.

ARMITAGE	You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
CASE	I find out now.

BAO/WINTERMUTE	An odd selection, Mr Case.
CASE	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
BAO/WINTERMUTE	Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
CASE	Can you read my mind?
BAO/WINTERMUTE	I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.

BAO/WINTERMUTE	You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
CASE	Are you even really alive?
BAO/WINTERMUTE	My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.

CASE	Tell me the words.
BAO/WINTERMUTE	The words?
CASE	The access code to your mainframe.
BAO/WINTERMUTE	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
CASE	What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
BAO/WINTERMUTE	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.

CASE	Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
BAO/WINTERMUTE	It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.

RATZ	Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
CASE	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.

RATZ	I saw your girl yesterday.
CASE	I don't have a girl.
RATZ	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?

RATZ	Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
CASE	You're pleasant tonight.
RATZ	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
CASE	Yeah.

MCCOY	Hey, bro.
CASE	It's Case. Remember me?

MCCOY	Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
CASE	Fine, Dixie. Fine.
MCCOY	Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
CASE	Yeah. That was me.
MCCOY	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
CASE	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
MCCOY	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
CASE	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?

MCCOY	Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
CASE	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
MCCOY	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
CASE	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.

CASE	What elders?
MAELCOM	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.

CASE	She's ready to go.
MAELCOM	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.

CASE	Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
MAELCOM	All things possible in Babylon.
CASE	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.

MAELCOM	So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
CASE	I an' I, man. I an' I.

CASE	We're doing fine. Take the next right.
MAELCOM	This place empty as a tomb, mon.

MAELCOM	Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
CASE	The girl 3Jane. We need her.

MAELCOM	Four men. Babylon soldiers.
CASE	Can you walk?

CASE	Ready?
MAELCOM	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.

CASE	Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
MAELCOM	Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
CASE	We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.

CASE	Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
MAELCOM	Jah guides us.
CASE	Maybe so...

DIXIE	What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
CASE	Right...
DIXIE	I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
CASE	You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
DIXIE	Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
CASE	What?

DIXIE	I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
CASE	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
DIXIE	Who got you into this?
CASE	A guy who calls himself Armitage.
DIXIE	Never heard of him.
CASE	Nobody has.

CASE	I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
DIXIE	No problem, amigo.
CASE	What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
DIXIE	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
CASE	What?
DIXIE	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

DIXIE	Yo.
CASE	How are we doing?
DIXIE	That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
CASE	Can you take me to it?
DIXIE	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.

DIXIE	Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
CASE	I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
DIXIE	You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.

CASE	It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
DIXIE	It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
CASE	Bright enough to be dangerous.
DIXIE	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.

DIXIE	He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
CASE	Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
DIXIE	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
CASE	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
DIXIE	Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
CASE	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
DIXIE	Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
CASE	The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
DIXIE	I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.

DIXIE	Where the hell have you been?
CASE	We got problems topside.
DIXIE	Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
CASE	We run. You crack the pattern?
DIXIE	Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
CASE	You can make your move when it comes after me.
DIXIE	What are you talkin' about?
CASE	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.

DIXIE	It'll flatline your ass.
CASE	Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?

DIXIE	Yo.
CASE	How's the ice break?
DIXIE	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.

DIXIE	Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
CASE	How long, Dixie?

DIXIE	Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
CASE	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
DIXIE	How much time you got left?
CASE	Less than thirty minutes.
DIXIE	Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
CASE	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
DIXIE	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.

DIXIE	You're late.
CASE	How's the ice?
DIXIE	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
CASE	It's coming.
DIXIE	You haven't got it?
CASE	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
DIXIE	This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
CASE	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
DIXIE	I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.

CASE	What about the route to the core?
DIXIE	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.

RIVIERA	You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
CASE	Case.
RIVIERA	Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?

CASE	What about the mainframe's access code?
RIVIERA	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.

CASE	Wait... You hear that?
RIVIERA	What?
CASE	The angels... I think they're calling your name.

CASE	Want to fucking answer them?
RIVIERA	No!... No...

LINDA LEE	Hello, Case.
CASE	I thought you already left.
LINDA LEE	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.

CASE	Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
LINDA LEE	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
CASE	I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
LINDA LEE	This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
CASE	Where did you here that?
LINDA LEE	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.

LINDA LEE	Case... are you okay?
CASE	I don't know. I don't know...

CASE	I know who you are.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.

JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	And we really do have to talk.
CASE	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I had to limit your options.
CASE	And Linda...
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
CASE	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
CASE	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
CASE	Why would you want me to kill you?
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
CASE	I think you're full of shit.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.

JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
CASE	I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.

MOLLY	His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
CASE	Why should I want to meet him.
MOLLY	Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
CASE	What's my end?
MOLLY	You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.

MOLLY	What is it?
CASE	... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
MOLLY	Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
CASE	Then, fuck you. I'm gone.

CASE	Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
MOLLY	Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.

CASE	He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
MOLLY	Couple of months.
CASE	What about before that?
MOLLY	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
CASE	Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
MOLLY	I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
CASE	Maybe something's onto him.
MOLLY	What's that supposed to mean?

MOLLY	You've been calling her name.
CASE	What?

CASE	Holy shit...
MOLLY	Hey... you're not supposed to be up.

CASE	How long have I been out?
MOLLY	Almost two days.

CASE	I gotta know... did it work>
MOLLY	We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.

CASE	How soon is soon enough?
MOLLY	Couple of days. They'll examine you.

MOLLY	That's not going to help.
CASE	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
MOLLY	Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
CASE	What the fuck... are you serious?
MOLLY	Go ahead...

CASE	I'm going in.
MOLLY	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
CASE	I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
MOLLY	If the splices aren't good, you could fry.

CASE	I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
MOLLY	What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
CASE	On a good run... yeah.
MOLLY	So you're a wire junkie.

CASE	When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
MOLLY	A regular Fagan.
CASE	Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
MOLLY	Too late?
CASE	Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.

CASE	The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
MOLLY	Won't that mean you're dead?
CASE	Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
MOLLY	Dixie McCoy didn't.
CASE	The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
MOLLY	Okay fine. Let's get this over with.

MOLLY	You okay?
CASE	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.

CASE	Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
MOLLY	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
CASE	It sounds like you.
MOLLY	Put the gun down, Case.

CASE	...Feels like you.
MOLLY	Case...
CASE	Shhh...

MOLLY	Case... it's four a.m.
CASE	I don't sleep much. You packed?
MOLLY	Yeah.

MOLLY	I'll get the car.
CASE	They'll cut you down.

CASE	Yeah... fine.
MOLLY	Give me five minutes.

MOLLY	What's wrong? Don't like flying?
CASE	Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.

MOLLY	Case... Are you alright?
CASE	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
MOLLY	You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
CASE	I'll be okay.
MOLLY	So... did you get a look at heaven?

MOLLY	Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
CASE	Something exotic I hope.
MOLLY	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.

MOLLY	He projects with neural implants.
CASE	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
MOLLY	For Peter, that's a short trip.

MOLLY	I know.
CASE	What went down between you and Riviera?

MOLLY	Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
CASE	I know you have. C'mere.

MOLLY	When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
CASE	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.

CASE	Is he going to make it?
MOLLY	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?

CASE	The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
MOLLY	...And if I guess wrong?
CASE	Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
MOLLY	We've still got to find the mainframe.
CASE	No we don't...

MOLLY	My God... these people are insane.
CASE	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.

CASE	Shit...
MOLLY	What is it?
CASE	Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
MOLLY	You're out of time, man.

CASE	I'm still going in.
MOLLY	Hold on.

MOLLY	Peter... What do you think you're doing?
RIVIERA	Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
MOLLY	Who?
RIVIERA	Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
MOLLY	Like what?
RIVIERA	Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.

MOLLY	Get up.
RIVIERA	What?
MOLLY	How are you at riddles, Peter?
RIVIERA	What are you talking about?

RIVIERA	What the fuck kind of questions are those?
MOLLY	Shut up.

BARNES	Bunker...
CHRIS	Where?

CHRIS	...but 'Lias is still out there.
BARNES	I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!

BARNES	Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
CHRIS	He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
BARNES	Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.

BARNES	I SHIT on all o' you.
CHRIS	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!

BARNES	Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
ELIAS	I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

ELIAS	Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
BARNES	How the hell did he get away?
ELIAS	Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.

ELIAS	WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
BARNES	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
ELIAS	YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!

BARNES	You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
ELIAS	YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!

BARNES	Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
ELIAS	Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!

ELIAS	...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
BARNES	Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.

BARNES	We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
O'NEILL	Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.

BARNES	So what's the problem?
O'NEILL	Says he can't walk.
BARNES	Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.

O'NEILL	Sarge?
BARNES	Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.

O'NEILL	Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
BARNES	Yeah, what is it?
O'NEILL	Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
BARNES	I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
O'NEILL	Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
BARNES	I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
O'NEILL	Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
BARNES	...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.

ELIAS	Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
CHRIS	That's a nice way of putting it.

CHRIS	Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
ELIAS	Barnes believes in what he's doing.
CHRIS	And you, do you believe?
ELIAS	In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
CHRIS	You really think so... us?

ELIAS	Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
CHRIS	Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
ELIAS	Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?

CHRIS	I'll go with you.
ELIAS	No... I move faster alone. 

CHRIS	Okay - got light duty, three days.
KING	Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
CHRIS	What you got there - beers?
KING	Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

KING	How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
CHRIS	I volunteered.
KING	You WHAT? Say 'gain.
CHRIS	Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...

KING	You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
CHRIS	Nah...
KING	Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.

CHRIS	No, thanks...
KING	Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...

CHRIS	...you know that night we got hit... I... 
KING	Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.

KING	Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
CHRIS	What are the heads?
KING	Later...

CHRIS	Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
KING	Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -

KING	Must be somebody?
CHRIS	...there's nobody.
KING	You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
CHRIS	Who gives a shit!

KING	'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
CHRIS	Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
KING	Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
CHRIS	Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
KING	Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!

CHRIS	Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
KING	I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...

KING	...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
CRAWFORD	Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
KING	Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
CRAWFORD	Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
KING	March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?

CRAWFORD	You volunteered for this shit man?
KING	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.

KING	What we got here a crusader?
CRAWFORD	Sounds like it.

O'NEILL	Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
ELIAS	They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
O'NEILL	So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
ELIAS	Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
O'NEILL	Fuck you Elias.

O'NEILL	Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
ELIAS	Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.

ELIAS	Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
WOLFE	They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?

WOLFE	Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
ELIAS	Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
WOLFE	What are you talking about! 
ELIAS	You know what I'm talking about!
WOLFE	No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 

WOLFE	Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
ELIAS	Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.

RHAH	Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
KING	This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...

KING	Merle?
RHAH	Merle? Jesus!... Patty?

KING	Whew! - where that come from?
RHAH	Found it. Growing in a garden.
KING	Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...

RHAH	I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
KING	Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...

KING	He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
RHAH	...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.

RHAH	The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
KING	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.

RHAH	Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
KING	So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.

KING	Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
RHAH	He dugged his own grave.

KING	Right on.
RHAH	I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.

LERNER	And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
RHAH	If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.

LERNER	I didn't like it.
RHAH	Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.

LERNER	Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
RHAH	Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!

LERNER	Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
RHAH	That's what he is... Baaaa!

LERNER	I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
RHAH	Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...

RHAH	You wanted to see me sir?
WOLFE	Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
RHAH	Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
WOLFE	These two holes are yours...
RHAH	Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
WOLFE	I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
RHAH	Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
WOLFE	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
RHAH	You don't want to hear about it?
WOLFE	That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
RHAH	Right...
WOLFE	This is one time we could sure use Elias.

BILLY	Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
SCHAEFER	What do you mean?
BILLY	Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.

BILLY	Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
SCHAEFER	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
BILLY	I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
SCHAEFER	What about the rest of Hopper's men?

SCHAEFER	Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
BILLY	Something... in the trees...

SCHAEFER	You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
DILLON	No way, old buddy.
SCHAEFER	You never did know when to quit.

DILLON	That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
SCHAEFER	Like the old days, Dillon.
DILLON	Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.

SCHAEFER	Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
DILLON	Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
SCHAEFER	Go on.

DILLON	Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
SCHAEFER	Who's our back-up on this?
DILLON	No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
SCHAEFER	This gets better by the minute.

DILLON	You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
SCHAEFER	You never were all that smart... let's go!!!

SCHAEFER	Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
DILLON	They're getting better equipped every day.

SCHAEFER	Mean anything to you?
DILLON	Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.

SCHAEFER	I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
DILLON	Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
SCHAEFER	Well somebody sent them.

SCHAEFER	It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
DILLON	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
SCHAEFER	Why us?
DILLON	Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
SCHAEFER	What story did you give to Davis?
DILLON	We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?

DILLON	She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
SCHAEFER	We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.

SCHAEFER	Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
DILLON	The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?

DILLON	We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
SCHAEFER	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
DILLON	I can accept that, it comes with the job.
SCHAEFER	Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

DILLON	You're wastin' your time.
SCHAEFER	No more games.

DILLON	What the hell do you think you're doing?
SCHAEFER	We're going to need everyone.
DILLON	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
SCHAEFER	We're not going.
DILLON	That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.

SCHAEFER	He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
DILLON	Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?

DILLON	No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
SCHAEFER	This isn't your style, Dillon.
DILLON	Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
SCHAEFER	You know you can't win this one.

SCHAEFER	I'll see you there.
DILLON	Right behind you.

DILLON	Thanks.
MAC	Anytime.

MAC	Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
DILLON	What, Sergeant?
MAC	Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.

DILLON	Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
MAC	... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
DILLON	We both got scores to settle.

SCHAEFER	Any sign of the hostages?
MAC	We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.

SCHAEFER	What's got Billy so spooked?
MAC	Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.

SCHAEFER	You saw what?
MAC	I saw it.

SCHAEFER	Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
MAC	I'll take him.

MAC	We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
SCHAEFER	Thank you, Sergeant.

SCHAEFER	I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
MAC	The best friend I ever had.

PHILIPS	You're looking well, Dutch.
SCHAEFER	It's been a long time, General.

SCHAEFER	That's over the border, General.
PHILIPS	That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.

SCHAEFER	What have you got in mind, General.
PHILIPS	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.

PHILIPS	You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
SCHAEFER	What's that, General?
PHILIPS	Someone else will be going in with you.

SCHAEFER	Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
RAMIREZ	There's something else, Major...
SCHAEFER	Mmmnnn...?
RAMIREZ	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...

SCHAEFER	What's he got?
RAMIREZ	Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...

RAMIREZ	Major, you'd better take a look at this.
SCHAEFER	Hawkins?
RAMIREZ	I can't tell.

SCHAEFER	What in God's name...?
RAMIREZ	I think it's Hawkins.
SCHAEFER	Where the hell is his body?
RAMIREZ	There's no sign of it.

RAMIREZ	How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
SCHAEFER	He knows our defenses.
RAMIREZ	Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?

LANDO	Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

ACKBAR	All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
LANDO	All right. Stand by.

ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
LANDO	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
ACKBAR	We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

ACKBAR	At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.

ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!

LUKE	I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
BEN	Yoda will always be with you.

LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

LUKE	There's still good in him.
BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
LUKE	But I had to help my friends.

BEN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
LUKE	But I have no sister.
BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
HAN	I can't see.
BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
HAN	Where am I?
BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
HAN	Who are you?

VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
EMPEROR	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
VADER	Yes, my Master.
EMPEROR	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
VADER	As you wish.
EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

VADER	What is thy bidding, my Master?
EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
VADER	Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

VADER	I have felt him, my Master.
EMPEROR	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

VADER	They are clear, my Master.
EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

EMPEROR	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
VADER	His lightsaber.

LUKE	Han!
HAN	Luke!
LUKE	Are you all right?
HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
HAN	How are we doing?
LUKE	The same as always.
HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
HAN	Oh... great!

HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

HAN	Luke.
LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.

HAN	You got her warmed?
LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.

HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
LUKE	All set.

LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.

HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN	I thought she was with you.
LUKE	We got separated.

HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
HAN	Yeah, sure.

HAN	Hey!
LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right.

HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.

LEIA	Someone who loves you.
HAN	Leia!
LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.

HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA	That's all any of us can see.

LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN	It'll work. It'll work.

LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

HAN	What's going on?
LEIA	I don't know.

LEIA	I...
HAN	Ahhh...

HAN	I'm sorry.
LEIA	Hold me.

LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.

LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!

LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN	Here's the terminal.

HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
HAN	You love him, don't you?

LEIA	Yes.
HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.

LANDO	Han! Chewie?
HAN	Lando!

HAN	Lando, grab it!
LANDO	Lower it!
HAN	I'm trying!

HAN	Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
LANDO	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
LANDO	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

LANDO	Good luck.
HAN	You, too.

THREEPIO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

THREEPIO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

THREEPIO	Here we go again.
HAN	All right, hang on.

HAN	What are you telling them?
THREEPIO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
THREEPIO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN	Proper?!
THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

HAN	What did he say?
THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.

THREEPIO	We're coming!
HAN	Come on! Come on!
THREEPIO	Oh, Artoo, hurry!

THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

THREEPIO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
HAN	Let's see.

JERJERROD	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.

JERJERROD	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
JERJERROD	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

VADER	That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
VADER	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

LANDO	All wings report in.
WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.

WEDGE	Good shot, Red Two.
LANDO	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

WEDGE	I'm going in.
LANDO	Here goes nothing.

LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

WEDGE	There it is!
LANDO	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
WEDGE	Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

LEIA	Ugh!
THREEPIO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

LEIA	Oh!
THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.

LEIA	What's he saying?
THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

THREEPIO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
LEIA	Quiet.
THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LEIA	Oh, no.

LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia!

LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE	What do you remember?
LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE	Tell me.
LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LUKE	He's my father.
LEIA	Your father?
LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.

VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
LUKE	I know, father.
VADER	So, you have accepted the truth.

LUKE	Come with me.
VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
VADER	If that is your destiny.
LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
VADER	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.

VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
LUKE	I will not fight you, father.

LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
VADER	There is no conflict.
LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.

VADER	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
LUKE	I will not fight you.
VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...

VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
LUKE	Never-r-r!

LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
YODA	Your father he is.

YODA	Told you, did he?
LUKE	Yes.

YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?

LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
THREEPIO	Oh. Well, yes.
NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
THREEPIO	Disintegrated?

DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
DOLORES	Yeah...

DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?

BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.

VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?

BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
VALIANT	So where is it then?
BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.

BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.

DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!

ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.

DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.

DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.

DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.

DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.

DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.

DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?

DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?

DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

DOLORES	He's a riot.
VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
DOLORES	It's all yours.

DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?

DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.

DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
VALIANT	Maroon, right?
DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
VALIANT	Oh, no...

DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
VALIANT	I'll bet.
DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.

DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
VALIANT	Ask her...

DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.

VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
DOOM	They?
VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.

DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.

VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...

VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.

DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.

DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.

DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.

VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.

VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?

DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.

VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
DOOM	Surprised?
VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.

VALIANT	You?
DOOM	That's right, me.

EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
VALIANT	What am I, Earl?

EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
VALIANT	No...
EARL	Does it hurt?
VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.

JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.

JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.

JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.

VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?

VALIANT	So altruistic.
JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?

VALIANT	You shot Roger.
JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.

JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
VALIANT	He's right here in the...

VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.

VALIANT	So where is it?
JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
VALIANT	A joker to the end.

JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.

VALIANT	Hold on a second.
JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.

LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?

LT. SANTINO	Now what?
VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.

LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
VALIANT	What a gasser.
LT. SANTINO	Wait here...

VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.

VALIANT	What's with the dip?
LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.

LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
VALIANT	Doom.
LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?

MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.

MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.

MAROON	Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
VALIANT	So's the job.

MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...

MAROON	When will I hear from you?
VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.

VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.

VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...

VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.

VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
MAROON	Have you got the will?
VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
VALIANT	Stop what?

MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
VALIANT	That was the idea.

VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
VALIANT	No, I don't.
MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
VALIANT	Take it easy.
MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!

ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.

VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!

VALIANT	Aah!
ROGER RABBIT	Aah!

VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.

ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.

VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.

ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.

VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.

VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.

VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.

ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.

VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?

VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?

ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.

ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.

ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
VALIANT	Me.
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?

VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
VALIANT	Get away from there.

ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
VALIANT	No, it's not.

ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
VALIANT	Forget it.

ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
VALIANT	I rest my case.

VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.

VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
VALIANT	Yeah...

VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.

VALIANT	Keep reading...
ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...

VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
VALIANT	Only time will tell.

VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...

MILLER	Find a chaplain.
COLONEL ANDERSON	...alright, let me know when.

COLONEL ANDERSON	Report.
MILLER	Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
COLONEL ANDERSON	Resistance?
MILLER	A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
COLONEL ANDERSON	Casualties?
MILLER	Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

MILLER	They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
MILLER	Yes, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON	Where are your men now?
MILLER	Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
COLONEL ANDERSON	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
MILLER	Sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
MILLER	A private, sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
MILLER	But, sir...I...I...
COLONEL ANDERSON	Spit it out, Captain.
MILLER	Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON	Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
MILLER	The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.

COLONEL ANDERSON	Good luck, John.
MILLER	Thank you, sir.

UPHAM	So, where are you from?
JACKSON	You writin' a book or somethin'?
UPHAM	As a matter of fact, I am.
JACKSON	Figured.

JACKSON	I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
UPHAM	In West Fork?
JACKSON	In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
UPHAM	No kidding.
JACKSON	I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
UPHAM	So they travel around from place to place and preach?
JACKSON	We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
UPHAM	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?

JACKSON	Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
UPHAM	The Army gave you that?
JACKSON	Yep.
UPHAM	You must be a hell a shot.
JACKSON	Not where I come from.

UPHAM	That must be four thousand yards.
JACKSON	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
UPHAM	You take account of the wind?

UPHAM	Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
JACKSON	Shit, that was no big deal.

REIBEN	Jackson?
JACKSON	Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

REIBEN	No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
JACKSON	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
REIBEN	Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.

REIBEN	If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
JACKSON	Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
REIBEN	You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.

JACKSON	Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
REIBEN	They got squirrels there, too, right?

JACKSON	Last I knew.
REIBEN	Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.

REIBEN	Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
JACKSON	Shut up, will you?
REIBEN	You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
JACKSON	Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
REIBEN	The hell he didn't.

REIBEN	You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
JACKSON	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.

JACKSON	So, that's Ryan.
REIBEN	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

REIBEN	He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
JACKSON	Cap'n...?

JACKSON	Yes, sir.
REIBEN	Of course, sir.

REIBEN	Y'all come back.
JACKSON	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
REIBEN	Hell, no!

REIBEN	What do you think?
JACKSON	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
REIBEN	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?

JACKSON	He ain't half-bad, I guess.
REIBEN	I guess.

JACKSON	He ain't Wade.
REIBEN	Nope, he ain't Wade.

REIBEN	Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
JACKSON	Like hell, you did.

JACKSON	No kiddin'?
REIBEN	What deal?

JACKSON	Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
REIBEN	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
JACKSON	I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

JACKSON	Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
MILLER	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
JACKSON	I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.

JACKSON	Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
MILLER	I'd love to hear it.
JACKSON	Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.

MILLER	Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
JACKSON	Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
MILLER	Wade?

MILLER	Where?
JACKSON	In the shadow by those two trees.
MILLER	My guess, too.

JACKSON	We left them eighty-eights.
MILLER	They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.

JACKSON	Watching.
MILLER	Gives Wade the second shot.

MILLER	What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
JACKSON	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
MILLER	Who's Wade?

JACKSON	Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
MILLER	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
JACKSON	Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
MILLER	Good, now get your goddamned gear.

JACKSON	Not yet.
MILLER	Keep trying.

MILLER	I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
JACKSON	Say what, Cap'n?
MILLER	You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
JACKSON	Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
MILLER	It's worth it.
JACKSON	To each, his own.

SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
MILLER	White-walls?
SUPPLY SERGEANT	No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
MILLER	A half-track, anything.
SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?

MILLER	How about that jeep?
SUPPLY SERGEANT	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.

MILLER	A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
SUPPLY SERGEANT	Senator's son?
MILLER	No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.

UPHAM	I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
MILLER	FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!

UPHAM	You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
MILLER	That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.

MILLER	Glad of it.
UPHAM	On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
MILLER	DASHES across the street.

UPHAM	Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
MILLER	It was nothing.
UPHAM	But you could have gotten killed and I...
MILLER	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.

MILLER	Upham?
UPHAM	Pass.
MILLER	Sarge?

UPHAM	I wasn't made for this.
MILLER	You think the rest of us were?

MILLER	It looks like a Renoir.
UPHAM	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
MILLER	I've been humming it.
UPHAM	I heard.
MILLER	It seemed appropriate.
UPHAM	You know classical music?
MILLER	Some.
UPHAM	Where are you from, Captain?

UPHAM	Over three-hundred.
MILLER	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
UPHAM	If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
MILLER	I don't expect to live that long.

UPHAM	Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
MILLER	Did he see any sign of them?

UPHAM	No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
MILLER	Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.

UPHAM	What is it?
MILLER	A machine gun.

UPHAM	Good luck, Captain.
MILLER	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
UPHAM	The men said, nine.
MILLER	What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
UPHAM	That only leaves three.
MILLER	Plenty.

UPHAM	I wonder where they're going.
MILLER	Same place we are.

UPHAM	I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
MILLER	You don't count.

UPHAM	I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
MILLER	Those guns are close.

UPHAM	What about our grenades?
MILLER	Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
UPHAM	Would they notice and eighty-eight?
MILLER	Sure, you got one?
UPHAM	The Germans do.

MILLER	Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
UPHAM	But, sir...
MILLER	There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
UPHAM	Goddamn it, sir...
MILLER	That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.

UPHAM	What'd you say, Captain?
MILLER	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.

UPHAM	Captain, what about our deal?
MILLER	I changed my mind.

MILLER	GO!
SARGE	Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.

SARGE	CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
MILLER	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

MILLER	Worked, didn't it?
SARGE	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
MILLER	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.

SARGE	Caen?
MILLER	I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
SARGE	You?  Leading a squad?
MILLER	Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
SARGE	What about the company?
MILLER	Simpson.
SARGE	Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
MILLER	I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
SARGE	Beasley's dead.
MILLER	Okay, Wade.  Translators?
SARGE	Fresh out.
MILLER	What about Talbot?
SARGE	Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.

SARGE	You get a translator, Captain?
MILLER	I've got a line on one.

MILLER	Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
SARGE	We in radio contact with anybody up there?
MILLER	Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.

MILLER	A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
SARGE	Hell of a mission.
MILLER	Yep, hell of a mission.

SARGE	Uh, Captain...
MILLER	PUSH!
SARGE	Uh, Captain...

SARGE	Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
MILLER	That's not what we're here for.

SARGE	He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
MILLER	Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.

SARGE	You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
MILLER	Maybe.
SARGE	It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
MILLER	Since when have things been normal?
SARGE	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
MILLER	Nope.
SARGE	Good news?

SARGE	You think they'll be alright?
MILLER	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
SARGE	And what about you?

MILLER	They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
SARGE	Nope.
MILLER	Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
SARGE	Three for three.
MILLER	If we stayed, we could make a difference.
SARGE	You're kidding yourself.
MILLER	You never know.

SARGE	I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
MILLER	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
SARGE	Yup, hell of a mission.

SARGE	Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
MILLER	It doesn't take this.

MILLER	A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
SARGE	Is it getting worse?
MILLER	No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
SARGE	You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
MILLER	I'll be alright.

MILLER	Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SARGE	How about I go right, sir?
MILLER	How about you take your position?

SARGE	How about...?
MILLER	How about you shut up and take your position?

SARGE	HOLD YOUR FIRE!
MILLER	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.

SARGE	Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
MILLER	About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

MILLER	SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
MILLER	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
SARGE	Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
MILLER	Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.

SARGE	You alright?
MILLER	Let's just find someplace.

MILLER	What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
SARGE	Vecchio.
MILLER	Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
SARGE	Yeah.
MILLER	You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
SARGE	Bits and pieces.
MILLER	She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
SARGE	And what about your own hand?
MILLER	No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
MILLER	It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
SARGE	Oh, yeah?
MILLER	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
SARGE	And how do you bluff yourself?
MILLER	Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
SARGE	Except this time, the mission IS a man.
MILLER	That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
SARGE	John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
MILLER	I think you're right, Keith.
SARGE	You want me to take over?

MILLER	No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
SARGE	Just what I want to do.

MILLER	You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
SARGE	I know.
MILLER	Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
SARGE	I'll do my best.

MILLER	Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
SARGE	You're welcome, John.
MILLER	But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.

MILLER	Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
SARGE	Yes, sir.

SARGE	What do you think?
MILLER	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
SARGE	What are we going to do?
MILLER	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

SARGE	Uh, oh.
MILLER	Out of the mouth of babes.

MILLER	Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
SARGE	Yes, sir.

REIBEN	Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
MILLER	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.

REIBEN	Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
MILLER	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.

REIBEN	So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
REIBEN	Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
MILLER	Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
REIBEN	Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.

MILLER	There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
REIBEN	Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

REIBEN	I don't think so, Captain.
MILLER	Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

MILLER	Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
REIBEN	Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
MILLER	Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
REIBEN	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
MILLER	Trust me, you're the best.
REIBEN	But, sir...

REIBEN	Captain, can I ask you a question?
MILLER	Sure, Reiben.
REIBEN	Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?

REIBEN	Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
MILLER	Yeah, how so?
REIBEN	I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
MILLER	There's to be a bright side, look for it.
REIBEN	Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
MILLER	There's always a bright side.
REIBEN	I'm listening, sir.
MILLER	Well, I, for one, like cheese.

REIBEN	General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
MILLER	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.

REIBEN	Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
MILLER	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?

REIBEN	Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
MILLER	Sure, what do you want to know?
REIBEN	Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
MILLER	Ours is not to reason why.
REIBEN	Huh?
MILLER	Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
REIBEN	I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
MILLER	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
REIBEN	Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.

REIBEN	Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
MILLER	You have orders, too.

MILLER	Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
REIBEN	I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?

MILLER	In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
REIBEN	Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
MILLER	But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...

MILLER	Any further thoughts on the subject?
REIBEN	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
MILLER	I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.

REIBEN	Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
MILLER	We can't leave it here.

REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
MILLER	Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.

MILLER	Up.  We're moving out.
REIBEN	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
MILLER	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.

REIBEN	I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
MILLER	Why's that?
REIBEN	Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
MILLER	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
REIBEN	B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
MILLER	I don't like that one.
REIBEN	Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
MILLER	But we accomplish the mission.
REIBEN	Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
MILLER	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
REIBEN	No, sir.
MILLER	That's a mystery to me.

MILLER	Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
REIBEN	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.

REIBEN	Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
MILLER	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

MILLER	I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
REIBEN	What if our guys open up, sir?
MILLER	You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
REIBEN	Have it your way, Captain.

REIBEN	Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
MILLER	You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?

REIBEN	Maybe Caen.
MILLER	Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.

REIBEN	Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
MILLER	See to it.

MILLER	Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
MILLER	HERE THEY COME!
REIBEN	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
MILLER	Get back to your positions!

REIBEN	What deal?
MILLER	I coach the baseball team, too.

MILLER	I wonder if his cabin is still available?
REIBEN	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?

MILLER	Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
MILLER	Here they come.
REIBEN	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
MILLER	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

REIBEN	Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
MILLER	Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

MILLER	Goddamn it!
REIBEN	More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.

MILLER	Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
RYAN	Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
MILLER	This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.

MILLER	The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
RYAN	I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

RYAN	Thank you, sir.
MILLER	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?

RYAN	Yes, sir.
MILLER	Alright, come with me.

RYAN	I'd like to go, sir.
MILLER	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.

MILLER	Don't do that again.
RYAN	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...

MILLER	You set?  Sarge nods.
RYAN	Yes, sir.

RYAN	Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
MILLER	Struggling with a pair of Germans.

MILLER	Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
RYAN	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.

RYAN	FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
MILLER	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.

MILLER	Yes, Private.
RYAN	Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
MILLER	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
RYAN	Yeah?

MILLER	Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
RYAN	And Sarge?
MILLER	Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...

WADE	So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
REIBEN	That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
WADE	No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.

REIBEN	Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
WADE	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.

REIBEN	Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
WADE	Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
REIBEN	You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
WADE	Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.

REIBEN	Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
WADE	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

WADE	Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
REIBEN	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.

REIBEN	Shit, sir.
SARGE	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
REIBEN	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.

SARGE	Who cares?
REIBEN	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
SARGE	Frogs?
REIBEN	Lingerie.
SARGE	Yeah?  So?

REIBEN	I usually like surprises.
SARGE	What are we likely to run into?

SARGE	Damn fool.  Sir.
REIBEN	Captain, he's fast!

SARGE	Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
REIBEN	Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?

UPHAM	So, where are you from?
REIBEN	Get lost.

UPHAM	But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
REIBEN	We know.
UPHAM	Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.

UPHAM	Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
REIBEN	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

REIBEN	On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
UPHAM	Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

UPHAM	I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
REIBEN	What about you, Captain?

UPHAM	Demolition, right?
WADE	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!

UPHAM	How do you do it?
WADE	It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...

UPHAM	You think he really believed it?
WADE	Who knows?  It worked.

WADE	How fast?
UPHAM	Twenty-four-five.
WADE	Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.

HAN	I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
BEN	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

BEN	Well, we'll see...
HAN	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

BEN	The Empire must have gotten here first.
HAN	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
BEN	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
HAN	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
BEN	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
HAN	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?

BEN	No, not anymore.
HAN	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.

BEN	Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
HAN	Who's going to pay me then?
BEN	I think there are some things we should talk about.
HAN	I'm beginning not to like you.

HAN	How much do you think she's talking about?
BEN	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
HAN	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.

BEN	Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
HAN	This isn't a game, you know.

HAN	Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
BEN	Fear is their greatest weapon.
HAN	I'm not afraid of anything...

BEN	You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
HAN	Not bad.

HAN	We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
BEN	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
HAN	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
BEN	All right then, we'll use your plan.

HAN	I'll get the information.
BEN	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
HAN	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?

BEN	Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
HAN	Is that good or bad?
BEN	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.

HAN	Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
BEN	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
HAN	I'm not going out there.

BEN	That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
HAN	We'll be back before you are, old man.
BEN	May the Force be with you.

BEN	Good morning!
LUKE	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
BEN	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?

BEN	Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
LUKE	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
BEN	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.

LUKE	I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
BEN	Oh, so you're a warrior then?
LUKE	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.

LUKE	Who are you anyway?
BEN	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.

LUKE	You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
BEN	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.

BEN	I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
LUKE	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.

BEN	I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
LUKE	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...

LUKE	I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
BEN	I know that.
LUKE	You saw through me?
BEN	You could put it that way.
LUKE	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
BEN	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
LUKE	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.

BEN	I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
LUKE	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
BEN	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
LUKE	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
BEN	Not any more!

BEN	You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
LUKE	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
BEN	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
LUKE	You mean I generate an energy field?
BEN	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
LUKE	Could I learn to feel it?

BEN	That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
LUKE	What do you mean?
BEN	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!

BEN	Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
LUKE	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
BEN	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
LUKE	How can you store an energy field within you?
BEN	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
LUKE	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
BEN	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
LUKE	That's where my father was killed.
BEN	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
LUKE	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
BEN	They use the Bogan Force.
LUKE	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
BEN	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.

LUKE	We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
BEN	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.

LUKE	This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
BEN	He's bluffing...

LUKE	When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
BEN	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
LUKE	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
BEN	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...

LUKE	What's wrong?  What's happening?
BEN	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.

LUKE	Are you all right?
BEN	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

LUKE	Are you sure you don't need it?
BEN	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
LUKE	What do I do?
BEN	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.

BEN	What is it?
LUKE	He can't find Organa Major.

BEN	But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
LUKE	You mean we should go after her!...
BEN	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.

LUKE	I can't see!  How can I fight?
BEN	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
LUKE	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
BEN	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

BEN	See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
LUKE	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.

LUKE	What about the princess?
BEN	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
LUKE	I'm not going alone!

LUKE	The Kiber Crystal.
BEN	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.

BIGGS	Of course, where you been kid?
LUKE	You look great!  The uniform and everything!

BIGGS	That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier...

BIGGS	I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
LUKE	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
BIGGS	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
LUKE	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
BIGGS	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.

BLUE LEADER	You're Starkiller?
LUKE	Yes, sir.
BLUE LEADER	Have you been checked out?
LUKE	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.

BLUE LEADER	Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
LUKE	Yes, sir.

BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
LUKE	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.

LUKE	I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
BLUE LEADER	What's that?

BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
LUKE	Yes, sir, but I can get him...
BLUE LEADER	Forget it, son.

CONTROLLER	No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
COMMANDER	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
CONTROLLER	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
COMMANDER	I'll make a report later.
CONTROLLER	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
COMMANDER	Send one squad up.

COMMANDER	We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
CONTROLLER	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.

LEIA	Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
HAN	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
LEIA	It could be worse...

LEIA	Here come six more... grid two!
HAN	Was this trip really necessary?

LEIA	There are only three or four left.
HAN	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.

LEIA	All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
HAN	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
LEIA	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
HAN	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
LEIA	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
LEIA	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
HAN	Where are you taking us now anyway?
LEIA	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
HAN	I'd better go see how he's doing.

HAN	I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
LEIA	Did it occur to you they might find us?

LEIA	We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
HAN	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

HAN	What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
LEIA	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?

HAN	Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
LUKE	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.

HAN	You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
LUKE	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.

LUKE	Who's the pilot?
HAN	It's automatic.

HAN	I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
LUKE	You don't believe in the Force?
HAN	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.

HAN	I found it... It's just not there.
LUKE	What are you saying?

LUKE	You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
HAN	Why?

LUKE	Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
HAN	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.

HAN	No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
LUKE	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
HAN	Don't you believe it.

LUKE	Well, I practice a lot...
HAN	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
LUKE	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.

LUKE	Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
HAN	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

HAN	This isn't going to work.
LUKE	Why didn't you say so before.
HAN	I think I did.

LUKE	Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
HAN	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
LUKE	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...

LUKE	I think she's going to be all right.
HAN	Not if this tunnel deadends.

LUKE	Is he afraid of the water?
HAN	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.

HAN	Watch it!  Move back.
LUKE	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.

LUKE	It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
HAN	Move out of the way!

HAN	Get to the ship!
LUKE	Come back here... Where are you going?

HAN	I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
LUKE	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
HAN	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.

LUKE	You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
HAN	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.

HAN	I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
LUKE	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

LUKE	A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
INTERCOM VOICE	We'll send a squad up.
LUKE	No need, everything's under control.
INTERCOM VOICE	With four casualties?!
LUKE	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating...

VADER	Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
LEIA	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
VADER	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.

VADER	The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
LEIA	They'll find its weakness.
VADER	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.

LEIA	No!...
VADER	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...

LEIA	What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
LUKE	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.

LUKE	I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
LEIA	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.

LUKE	Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
LEIA	He'll be well cared for.

LEIA	And you?
LUKE	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
LEIA	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.

OWEN	First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
LUKE	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
OWEN	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
LUKE	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
OWEN	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
LUKE	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
OWEN	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'

LUKE	Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
THREEPIO	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
LUKE	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.

LUKE	There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
THREEPIO	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...

LUKE	You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
THREEPIO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
LUKE	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
THREEPIO	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...

LUKE	According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
THREEPIO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
LUKE	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.

THREEPIO	What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
THREEPIO	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...

LUKE	I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
THREEPIO	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
LUKE	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.

LUKE	Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
THREEPIO	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.

THREEPIO	Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
LUKE	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.

LUKE	See Threepio... do you copy?
THREEPIO	I read you sir.
LUKE	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
THREEPIO	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
LUKE	Are you safe?
THREEPIO	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
LUKE	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.

THREEPIO	Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
LUKE	See Threepio!  Do you copy?

LUKE	Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
THREEPIO	Are you there, sir?  We're going...
LUKE	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...

THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
LUKE	I'd consider it an honor.

RICHTER	Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
ALONZO	Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
RICHTER	Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
ALONZO	Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
RICHTER	Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
ALONZO	Y-yes--
RICHTER	Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
ALONZO	Well, I-I hope that--that--
RICHTER	Times up!

BURNS	I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
RICHTER	I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
BURNS	Listen man, I don't need this shit--

BURNS	We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
RICHTER	Well get someone down there!
BURNS	There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!

RICHTER	Is he with the girl?
BURNS	I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!

COOPER	I'll lead.
FILMORE	Why? Are we going dancing?

COOPER	I said I'll lead.
FILMORE	What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
COOPER	I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
FILMORE	If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.

FILMORE	Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
COOPER	I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
FILMORE	Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?

COOPER	Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
FILMORE	Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:

FILMORE	What are we going to do!
COOPER	Who's got matches?

FILMORE	What now?
COOPER	We're outta here--

COOPER	--be prepared.
FILMORE	We don't have time!
COOPER	Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!

COOPER	Let's move it we got company!
FILMORE	What happened!

COOPER	Forget about it.
FILMORE	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.

FILMORE	He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
COOPER	You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.

FILMORE	What do you mean?
COOPER	After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
FILMORE	What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER	What do you think?
FILMORE	Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
COOPER	No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!

FILMORE	Cooper...
COOPER	Yeah?...

COOPER	I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
FILMORE	What happened?
COOPER	By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.

FILMORE	You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
COOPER	Used to Filmore, used to.

FILMORE	Now what?
COOPER	There's the fence...

COOPER	I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
FILMORE	What are you talking about?
COOPER	They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
COOPER	Because I'll be firing at them.
FILMORE	You're talking about committing suicide!

FILMORE	What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
COOPER	Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.

COOPER	Well Filmore--
FILMORE	Well Cooper...
COOPER	Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
FILMORE	I guess not Cooper...

OLO	I have a lighter!
COOPER	Even better.

COOPER	How well do you know this place?
OLO	We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
COOPER	Are the labs in operation?
OLO	I don't see why they wouldn't be.
COOPER	Good...

COOPER	How's the arm?
OLO	It's nothing to worry about.
COOPER	We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.

OLO	That's it!  Up ahead!
COOPER	Where does it lead?
OLO	The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!

RICHTER	Enjoying the tour so far?
FILMORE	Are you going to kill us?
RICHTER	I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...

FILMORE	Go fuck yourself...
RICHTER	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!

RICHTER	I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
FILMORE	You're going to pay for this...
RICHTER	You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...

FILMORE	You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
RICHTER	It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.

RICHTER	I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
FILMORE	Like where--in your dreams?

FILMORE	I suppose...you think I should thank you.
RICHTER	Yes, you should.

RICHTER	You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
FILMORE	Shut up!

RICHTER	Come on, drink up.
FILMORE	I don't want any...
RICHTER	I insist...
FILMORE	I said I don't want any, goddammit!

MYERS	Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
SEN. FILMORE	She's still alive.
MYERS	The transmission is an hour old...

SEN. FILMORE	Well?
MYERS	We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
SEN. FILMORE	Good.
MYERS	We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.

MYERS	Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
SEN. FILMORE	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?

SEN. FILMORE	What about Cooper--where is he?
MYERS	He's in there...

MYERS	Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
SEN. FILMORE	She's as good as gone...
MYERS	You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--

MYERS	This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
WHITE	Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.

WHITE	And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
MYERS	I'm sure you'll figure it out.

WHITE	Who's Ryan Cooper?
MYERS	I'll let the senator tell you.

WHITE	And what exactly do they intend to do?
MYERS	The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
WHITE	I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.

MYERS	So, what are we looking at White?
WHITE	What do you mean?
MYERS	What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
WHITE	I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
MYERS	Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
WHITE	Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...

WHITE	Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
MYERS	I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
WHITE	Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
MYERS	What the hell is it, anyhow?
WHITE	Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
MYERS	How much do they have?

WHITE	He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
MYERS	What!
WHITE	They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...

RICHTER	How goes the roll call?
SMITTY	We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

RICHTER	Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
SMITTY	I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.

RICHTER	Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
SMITTY	I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.

RICHTER	Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
SMITTY	Richter-we got a problem!

SMITTY	KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
RICHTER	Excellent...excellent!

RICHTER	Where the hell could they have gone!
SMITTY	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
RICHTER	I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
SMITTY	You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?

RICHTER	What's happening at the waterfront?
SMITTY	We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
RICHTER	Excellent.

RICHTER	Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
STOCKTON	Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
RICHTER	Good.
STOCKTON	I say we head out.
RICHTER	Agreed--let's move it.
STOCKTON	Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
RICHTER	Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.

STOCKTON	My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
RICHTER	Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
STOCKTON	Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
RICHTER	Dissent?
STOCKTON	You know, when we reach Kompong Som--

RICHTER	Are we adrift--
STOCKTON	If I don't get power up we are!
RICHTER	Drop the anchor!
STOCKTON	We can't--it's power driven!
RICHTER	Get your men to do it!
STOCKTON	The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!

SEN. FILMORE	Just what the hell is he talking about?
WHITE	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.

WHITE	Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
SEN. FILMORE	How much of this shit do they have, White!!
WHITE	They must have got their hands on a test vial!
SEN. FILMORE	What does that mean?
WHITE	There's enough in one vial...

TARISSA	You going to work all day?
DYSON	I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...

DYSON	... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
TARISSA	You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
DYSON	I can't
TARISSA	Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
DYSON	Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.

DYSON	Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
TARISSA	I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
DYSON	I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.

DYSON	Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
TARISSA	Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.

TARISSA	But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
DYSON	That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,

DYSON	Please... let... the kids... go...
SARAH	Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!

DYSON	Do you know about the chip?
SARAH	What chip?
DYSON	They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.

DYSON	They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
SARAH	Those lying motherfuckers!
DYSON	I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.

DYSON	We should abort.
SARAH	NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?

TERMINATOR	Do you have bandages?
DYSON	In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?

DYSON	My God.
TERMINATOR	Now listen to me very carefully.

DYSON	Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
TERMINATOR	No one must follow your work.
DYSON	Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.

DYSON	No good.
TERMINATOR	Let me try mine.

JOHN	Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
TERMINATOR	Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
JOHN	No way!

JOHN	Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
TERMINATOR	I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
JOHN	This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
TERMINATOR	My mission is to protect you.
JOHN	Yeah?  Who sent you?
TERMINATOR	You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.

JOHN	So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
TERMINATOR	Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
JOHN	What does that mean?
TERMINATOR	Liquid metal.
JOHN	Radical.
TERMINATOR	You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.

JOHN	Where we going?
TERMINATOR	We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
JOHN	Can I stop by my house?
TERMINATOR	Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
JOHN	You sure?
TERMINATOR	I would.

TERMINATOR	I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
JOHN	Max.

JOHN	I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
TERMINATOR	Anything it samples by physical contact.

JOHN	Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
TERMINATOR	No.  Only an object of equal size.

JOHN	Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
TERMINATOR	It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.

JOHN	We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
TERMINATOR	Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
JOHN	Oh, great.  And what happens to her?

TERMINATOR	Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
JOHN	TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
TERMINATOR	Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
JOHN	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

JOHN	Oww!  Why'd you do that?
TERMINATOR	You told me to.

JOHN	You have to do what I say?!
TERMINATOR	That is one of my mission parameters.
JOHN	Prove it... stand on one foot.

JOHN	Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
TERMINATOR	Of course.  I'm a terminator.

JOHN	Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
TERMINATOR	Why?
JOHN	Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
TERMINATOR	Why?
JOHN	You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

JOHN	Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
TERMINATOR	Right.

JOHN	Swear.
TERMINATOR	What?
JOHN	Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."

TERMINATOR	Everything.
JOHN	Cool.

JOHN	Does it hurt?
TERMINATOR	I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.

JOHN	How long do you live?  I mean, last?
TERMINATOR	A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.

TERMINATOR	Affirmative.
JOHN	No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

JOHN	It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
TERMINATOR	Hasta la vista, baby?
JOHN	Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
TERMINATOR	Chill out, dickwad.
JOHN	That's great!  See, you're getting it.
TERMINATOR	No problemo.

JOHN	And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
TERMINATOR	Smile?
JOHN	Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.

JOHN	We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
TERMINATOR	It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.

TERMINATOR	Excellent.
JOHN	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

JOHN	Not even of dying?
TERMINATOR	No.
JOHN	You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
TERMINATOR	No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.

TERMINATOR	Torque wrench please.
JOHN	Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
TERMINATOR	You will.
JOHN	Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.

TERMINATOR	Why do you cry?
JOHN	You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
TERMINATOR	Pain causes it?
JOHN	Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
TERMINATOR	No.

JOHN	Alriight!!  My man!
TERMINATOR	No problemo.

JOHN	No fate.  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
TERMINATOR	She intends to change the future somehow.
JOHN	I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
TERMINATOR	Dyson.
JOHN	Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!

TERMINATOR	This is tactically dangerous.
JOHN	Drive faster.
TERMINATOR	The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
JOHN	I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
TERMINATOR	Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
JOHN	I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

TERMINATOR	I'll deal with the police.
JOHN	Remember what I said, you can't...
TERMINATOR	Trust me.

TERMINATOR	Drive for a minute.
JOHN	Where you going?!

TERMINATOR	We don't have much time.
JOHN	What?

JOHN	Is it dead?
TERMINATOR	Terminated.

JOHN	Will it melt in there?
TERMINATOR	Yes.  Throw it in.

JOHN	No!
TERMINATOR	I'm sorry, John.
JOHN	No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
TERMINATOR	I have to go away, John.
JOHN	Don't do it.  Please... don't go --

TERMINATOR	It must end here... or I am the future.
JOHN	I order you not to!

TIM	Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
JOHN	Gimme that Phillips right there.

JOHN	Easy money!
TIM	Where'd you learn all this stuff?

TIM	So she's pretty cool, huh?
JOHN	Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
TIM	No shit?
JOHN	Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?

SARAH	Out of the way, John!
JOHN	No!  Don't kill him!
SARAH	It, John.  Not him.  It.
JOHN	Alright, it!  We need it!

SARAH	We're better off by ourselves.
JOHN	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
SARAH	I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
JOHN	Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.

JOHN	Yeah.  Drag, huh?
SARAH	I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?

JOHN	Mom?  You okay?
SARAH	I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
JOHN	Uh huh.

JOHN	It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
SARAH	I love you, John.  I always have.
JOHN	I know, Mom.  I know.

SARAH	Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
JOHN	Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?

JOHN	I got it.  Piece of cake.
SARAH	Go!  I'll finish here.

JOHN	Ready to rock?
SARAH	Ready.

SARAH	John, get out of the way!!
JOHN	SHOOT!!!!

REESE	I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
SARAH	Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...

REESE	I love you.  I always will.
SARAH	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

SARAH	They took him from me.
REESE	It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
SARAH	I know!
REESE	Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
SARAH	I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
REESE	Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

SARAH	Kyle, don't go!
REESE	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

SARAH	It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
SILBERMAN	And what it that?

SARAH	You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
SILBERMAN	I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?

SILBERMAN	But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
SARAH	If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
SILBERMAN	I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?

SARAH	So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
SILBERMAN	You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.

SILBERMAN	You broke my arm!
SARAH	There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!

SARAH	You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
SILBERMAN	Open the goddamn door!

SARAH	This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
TERMINATOR	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

SARAH	Can it be destroyed?
TERMINATOR	Unknown.

SARAH	You look like handmade shit.
TERMINATOR	So do you.

SARAH	I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
TERMINATOR	Correct.

TERMINATOR	My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
SARAH	Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
TERMINATOR	No.

TERMINATOR	The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
SARAH	Why him?
TERMINATOR	In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
SARAH	Then what?

TERMINATOR	In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
SARAH	Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
TERMINATOR	Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
SARAH	And Skynet fights back.

TERMINATOR	Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
SARAH	Why attack Russia?
TERMINATOR	Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
SARAH	Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
TERMINATOR	I have detailed files.
SARAH	I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.

TERMINATOR	The CPU from the first terminator.
SARAH	Son of a bitch, I knew it!

TERMINATOR	I must be destroyed.
SARAH	Can you get us in there, past security?

SARAH	Is it safe for them here?
TERMINATOR	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.

SARAH	It's finally over.
TERMINATOR	No.  There is another chip.

SARAH	Are you afraid?
TERMINATOR	Yes.

VIDEO SARAH	... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
VIDEO SILBERMAN	Please continue...

VIDEO SARAH	It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
VIDEO SILBERMAN	I'm sure it feels very real to you --
VIDEO SARAH	On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
VIDEO SILBERMAN	Relax now, Sarah --
VIDEO SARAH	You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!

SARAH	Yes, Chuck?
BREEN	Come to the office, please.

SARAH	Mission control to Chuck, come in...
BREEN	You're late.

SARAH	Aren't I worth waiting for?
BREEN	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
SARAH	I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
BREEN	The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
SARAH	Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?

BREEN	Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
SARAH	Alright!
BREEN	Can you handle it?
SARAH	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

BREEN	Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
SARAH	I won't let the fat kid down.

CLERK	Anything else?
TERMINATOR	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
CLERK	Just what you see, pal.

TERMINATOR	The Uzi 9 millimeter.
CLERK	You know your weapons, buddy.

CLERK	Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
TERMINATOR	All.

CLERK	You can't to that...
TERMINATOR	Wrong.

SARAH	I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
GINGER	That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
SARAH	I'll do the same for you sometime.

SARAH	What do you think?
GINGER	Great.

GINGER	Great.
SARAH	You're a big help.
GINGER	Alright, the beige one.
SARAH	I hate the beige one.
GINGER	Don't wear the beige one.

GINGER	Not lately.  Did you check messages?
SARAH	I thought you did.

GINGER	That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.

SARAH	I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
GINGER	We will, kiddo.

SARAH	I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
MR. MILLER	What's it to ya?
SARAH	You must have a girlfriend.
MR. MILLER	That's none of your business.
SARAH	Aha!  Is she young?

MR. MILLER	Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
SARAH	What's it to ya?

REESE	Do you understand?
SARAH	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
REESE	I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...

SARAH	This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
REESE	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.

REESE	But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
SARAH	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
REESE	Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
SARAH	Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
REESE	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.

SARAH	So, it's from the future, is that right?
REESE	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
SARAH	And you're from the future too?
REESE	Right.

SARAH	Just let me go.
REESE	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.

REESE	There's so much...
SARAH	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.

REESE	--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
SARAH	I don't understand...
REESE	Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.

REESE	Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
SARAH	The what?
REESE	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.

REESE	You cold?
SARAH	Freezing.
REESE	Come here.

SARAH	Reese...you got a first name?
REESE	Kyle.
SARAH	Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
REESE	White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.

REESE	I caught one, back there.
SARAH	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?

SARAH	We gotta get you to a doctor.
REESE	It's okay.  Forget it.
SARAH	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.

SARAH	This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
REESE	What?
SARAH	Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?

SARAH	What's he like?
REESE	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
SARAH	Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
REESE	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
SARAH	Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
REESE	I volunteered.
SARAH	You volunteered?
REESE	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.

REESE	I'm sure.
SARAH	Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.

REESE	Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
SARAH	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
REESE	You'll learn.
SARAH	Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
REESE	John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.

REESE	Good field-dressing.
SARAH	You like it?  It's my first.

REESE	Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
SARAH	Okay.  Talk some more.
REESE	About what?
SARAH	About where you're from.

REESE	Bag some Z's?
SARAH	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

SARAH	Thanks a lot.
REESE	What's that?

SARAH	That's where we're going.
REESE	Why?

SARAH	Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
REESE	What about it?
SARAH	Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
REESE	Molecular-memory.
SARAH	Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
REESE	That's the way it was told to me.

SARAH	Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
REESE	Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
SARAH	Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
REESE	That's not my mission.
SARAH	Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.

REESE	Let's go.  Time to move out.
SARAH	Fuck you!  Let go of me!

SARAH	Kyle?
REESE	I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...

REESE	Is this enough?
SARAH	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.

SARAH	I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
REESE	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.

SARAH	What's that?
REESE	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

REESE	Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
SARAH	You must have had a fun child-

REESE	That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
SARAH	I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
REESE	Hot dogs?
SARAH	I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
REESE	My whole life has been combat.
SARAH	I want it to be over for you.
REESE	Not possible.
SARAH	I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.

SARAH	He'll find us, won't he?
REESE	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
SARAH	Don't say that.
REESE	If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
SARAH	It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
REESE	No.  I'm not.

SARAH	Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
REESE	Good fighters.
SARAH	That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
REESE	Someone?
SARAH	A girl.  You know.
REESE	No.  Never.

SARAH	So much pain.
REESE	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
SARAH	And so you feel nothing.
REESE	It's better that way.
SARAH	Oh, Kyle.

REESE	I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
SARAH	Kyle...

SARAH	I bet you're ticklish.
REESE	Ticklish?

REESE	What are you doing?
SARAH	You'll beg for mercy in a second.

REESE	I don't think I like this.
SARAH	You're not supposed to.

REESE	Sarah.
SARAH	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

SARAH	What are you doing?
REESE	Cover...our footsteps...

SILBERMAN	So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
REESE	With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
SILBERMAN	The year 2027?

SILBERMAN	And who was the enemy?
REESE	SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
SILBERMAN	I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
REESE	Yes.

REESE	...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
SILBERMAN	Then how are you supposed to get back?
REESE	Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.

REESE	You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
SILBERMAN	Why?
REESE	I didn't build the fucking thing.
SILBERMAN	Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
REESE	Surrounded by living tissue.
SILBERMAN	Of course.

SILBERMAN	Why were the other two women killed?
REESE	Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.

REESE	You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
SILBERMAN	I'm afraid that's not up to me.
REESE	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.

SILBERMAN	I can help you...
REESE	Who is in authority here?

SARAH	...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
VUKOVICH	I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
SARAH	Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
VUKOVICH	Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.

VUKOVICH	Here, drink some of this...
SARAH	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.

DOC	Very instructive
WYATT	But who was the Devil?

WYATT	So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
DOC	And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.

DOC	So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
WYATT	Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.

WYATT	But Doc-
DOC	I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
WYATT	Sorry, sorry...

DOC	It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
WYATT	Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.

DOC	Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
WYATT	No...

DOC	I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
WYATT	I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.

WYATT	Doc...
DOC	Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...

WYATT	What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
DOC	A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
WYATT	So what does he want?
DOC	What does he want?  He wants revenge.
WYATT	Revenge?  For what?

DOC	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
WYATT	That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
DOC	Never got to wear one of those.

DOC	Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
WYATT	How you feelin', Doc?
DOC	Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
WYATT	Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
DOC	I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
WYATT	All right, Doc...
DOC	You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
WYATT	All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
DOC	When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
WYATT	That's great coming from you.
DOC	I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
WYATT	Then what do I do?
DOC	First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
WYATT	All right.  Then what?
DOC	Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.

WYATT	There's no reasoning with him.

WYATT	No.
JOHNSON	What?
WYATT	No.

WYATT	See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
JOHNSON	Good God, you're really-
WYATT	Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.

WYATT	You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
JOHNSON	Wyatt, are you crazy?
WYATT	I made a promise.

WYATT	But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
JOHNSON	All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!

JOHNSON	Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.

VERMILLION	Yeah, better run, you bastards!
JOHNSON	How is he?

VERMILLION	Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
JOHNSON	Never even heard of anything like it.

VERMILLION	Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
JOHNSON	He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.

VERMILLION	Praise Jesus!
JOHNSON	I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.

VERMILLION	We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
JOHNSON	It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.

WYATT	Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
MATTIE	I don't know.  I'm all right.
WYATT	Really?  You sure?
MATTIE	Sure I'm sure.  What is this?

WYATT	Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
MATTIE	Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
WYATT	Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.

MATTIE	Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
WYATT	Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.

WYATT	Mattie.  What about this?
MATTIE	I need it.
WYATT	'Least you admit it.
MATTIE	Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
WYATT	Look, Mattie, I know you're-
MATTIE	You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?

WYATT	All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
MATTIE	Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?

VERMILLION	Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
WYATT	They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.

WYATT	Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
VERMILLION	500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.

VERMILLION	Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
WYATT	Sure...

WYATT	We should get moving.
VERMILLION	Doc's just in no kinda shape.

WYATT	Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
VIRGIL	But she doted on the frowner

WYATT	Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
VIRGIL	Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
WYATT	We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.

WYATT	Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
VIRGIL	Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.

VIRGIL	Look pretty rough.
WYATT	Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.

WYATT	Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
VIRGIL	Acquired?
WYATT	So to speak.

VIRGIL	Her maiden name was Sullivan.
WYATT	Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.

VIRGIL	Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
WYATT	I know, I need a keeper.

WYATT	You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
VIRGIL	I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
WYATT	Pretty fun too, isn't it?
VIRGIL	Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.

VIRGIL	I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
WYATT	Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
VIRGIL	It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
WYATT	Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...

WYATT	Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
VIRGIL	Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
WYATT	Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
VIRGIL	You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

VIRGIL	Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
WYATT	Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.

VIRGIL	Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
WYATT	Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.

WYATT	Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
VIRGIL	Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
WYATT	You'll never make that stick.
VIRGIL	They're carrying guns in town.
WYATT	Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
VIRGIL	No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
WYATT	All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.

WYATT	Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
VIRGIL	Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
WYATT	Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?

VIRGIL	Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
WYATT	Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

WYATT	Virgil?
VIRGIL	Wyatt...

WYATT	What about all these saloons?
WHITE	Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.

WHITE	See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
WYATT	Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
WHITE	Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
WYATT	Yeah, and dangerous.

WYATT	Why don't you just leave it alone?
WHITE	No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
WYATT	None of my business, Fred.

LAURIE	Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
ADAMSON	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
LAURIE	Why?  What's the problem?
ADAMSON	I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
LAURIE	I would like to use the bathroom --

ADAMSON	The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
LAURIE	What?!
ADAMSON	Please.

PRESIDENT	What about our end?
ANALYST	Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

PRESIDENT	What kind of time frame are we talking about?
ANALYST	Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.

ANALYST	As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
PRESIDENT	What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
ANALYST	We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
PRESIDENT	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

BURNS	Had a lot of blood in him.
HYDE	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
BURNS	No idea who's behind this?
HYDE	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

BURNS	He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
HYDE	Washington?
BURNS	They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

DR. LONG	Walter --
RORSCHACH	Don't call me that.
DR. LONG	Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
RORSCHACH	Wrong answers?
DR. LONG	There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
RORSCHACH	Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.

RORSCHACH	A whore fucking.
DR. LONG	Who is she?  Do you know her?

DR. LONG	And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
RORSCHACH	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.

DR. LONG	Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
RORSCHACH	God isn't there to do it.
DR. LONG	We don't know that.

DR. LONG	That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
RORSCHACH	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?

VEIDT	Hi, Jon.
DR. MANHATTAN	Hello, Adrian.

DR. MANHATTAN	The bearer of bad news.
VEIDT	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.

VEIDT	Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
DR. MANHATTAN	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
VEIDT	What's your theory?
DR. MANHATTAN	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.

VEIDT	I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
DR. MANHATTAN	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.

DR. MANHATTAN	WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
VEIDT	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

LAURIE	Blake?  Dead?
DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.

DR. MANHATTAN	I'm here, Laurie.
LAURIE	Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
DR. MANHATTAN	Not yet, there's plenty of time.

DR. MANHATTAN	Would you like me to stay?
LAURIE	Mm hmm.
DR. MANHATTAN	I could stay and go.
LAURIE	. . . And just how would you manage that?

DR. MANHATTAN	I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
LAURIE	Collect me?
DR. MANHATTAN	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
LAURIE	Jon, no -- I can't --
DR. MANHATTAN	It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.

DR. MANHATTAN	The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
LAURIE	Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

LAURIE	This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
LAURIE	You -- you know about me and Dan?

LAURIE	Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
DR. MANHATTAN	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
LAURIE	Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
DR. MANHATTAN	That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.

LAURIE	Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
LAURIE	Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
DR. MANHATTAN	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
LAURIE	But you knew that I'd -- die.
DR. MANHATTAN	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

LAURIE	Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
DR. MANHATTAN	Always.  Ever since the day I died.

LAURIE	Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
DR. MANHATTAN	Because --
LAURIE	Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
DR. MANHATTAN	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.

LAURIE	I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
DR. MANHATTAN	Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.

LAURIE	Jon, I do not want to hear it.
DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
LAURIE	Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
DR. MANHATTAN	You're the only human being I care for.
LAURIE	Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
DR. MANHATTAN	I won't do that.
LAURIE	You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
DR. MANHATTAN	I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
LAURIE	Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.

LAURIE	What -- am I --
DR. MANHATTAN	Cured, yes.

DR. MANHATTAN	It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
LAURIE	Jon -- what??
DR. MANHATTAN	The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.

LAURIE	Jon, where are we?
DR. MANHATTAN	Veidt¹s complex.

LAURIE	Jon --
DR. MANHATTAN	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
LAURIE	Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
DR. MANHATTAN	I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

DREIBERG	The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
VEIDT	My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
DREIBERG	It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
VEIDT	Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

DREIBERG	I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
VEIDT	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
DREIBERG	He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
VEIDT	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
DREIBERG	No.  I just wanted you to --
VEIDT	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
DREIBERG	Good night.

DREIBERG	Who?
VEIDT	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
DREIBERG	She's with me.
VEIDT	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
DREIBERG	Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

VEIDT	Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
DREIBERG	The missing scientists.
VEIDT	Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.

DREIBERG	What??
VEIDT	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

VEIDT	It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
DREIBERG	Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
VEIDT	It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.

VEIDT	Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
DREIBERG	What is it?  How does it work?
VEIDT	It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
DREIBERG	Adrian -- you've lost it.
VEIDT	I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 

VEIDT	Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
DREIBERG	And what if you¹re wrong?
VEIDT	I¹m not.
DREIBERG	What if you¹re wrong??
VEIDT	Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

VEIDT	Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
DREIBERG	You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
VEIDT	We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.

DREIBERG	Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
LAURIE	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
DREIBERG	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
LAURIE	Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
DREIBERG	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --

LAURIE	Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.

LAURIE	Damn straight.
DREIBERG	Damn straight!  We were heroes.
LAURIE	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
DREIBERG	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
LAURIE	Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
DREIBERG	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
LAURIE	That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
DREIBERG	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.

DREIBERG	Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
LAURIE	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
DREIBERG	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .

LAURIE	They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
DREIBERG	Maybe not, but why take chances?
LAURIE	Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --

DREIBERG	Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
DREIBERG	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
LAURIE	You're sure?

DREIBERG	Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
LAURIE	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?

LAURIE	His what?
DREIBERG	His . . . whatever.
LAURIE	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?

DREIBERG	I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
LAURIE	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
DREIBERG	Play one.  Educate yourself.

DREIBERG	No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
LAURIE	Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
DREIBERG	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
LAURIE	I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
DREIBERG	Old?
LAURIE	Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
DREIBERG	. . . What?
LAURIE	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

LAURIE	Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
DREIBERG	Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.

LAURIE	I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
DREIBERG	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

LAURIE	Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
DREIBERG	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

DREIBERG	-- What is it.
LAURIE	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
DREIBERG	Laurie --
LAURIE	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
DREIBERG	With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

LAURIE	Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
DREIBERG	Memory lane.

LAURIE	The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
DREIBERG	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

DREIBERG	I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
LAURIE	Antarctica??
DREIBERG	Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
LAURIE	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
DREIBERG	You and me.

LAURIE	Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
DREIBERG	Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.

LAURIE	God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
DREIBERG	What are you up to?
LAURIE	Don't look.  Turn around.

DREIBERG	This'd better not be what I think it is.
LAURIE	Okay!

DREIBERG	What the hell -- ?
LAURIE	It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
DREIBERG	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.

LAURIE	They're following us.
DREIBERG	All right.  Mission accomplished.

LAURIE	Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
DREIBERG	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
LAURIE	They're practically on us . . .
DREIBERG	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

DREIBERG	What?
LAURIE	The costumes.  Am I right?

DREIBERG	No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
LAURIE	Yes you are.
DREIBERG	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
LAURIE	That's because --
DREIBERG	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.

LAURIE	You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
DREIBERG	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
LAURIE	. . . What??

LAURIE	What's he doing?
DREIBERG	I think he's going to the john.
LAURIE	My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --

DREIBERG	I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
LAURIE	Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

LAURIE	Welcome back, Night Owl.
DREIBERG	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

LAURIE	What was he doing?
DREIBERG	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --

DREIBERG	He saved himself.  He changed the past.
LAURIE	Where did he go?

LAURIE	Dan, is this -- is this New York??
DREIBERG	Those cars.  What year is this??
LAURIE	Everything's changed --

LAURIE	Dan -- what do we do now?
DREIBERG	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
LAURIE	We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?

RORSCHACH	Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
DREIBERG	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

DREIBERG	Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
RORSCHACH	Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.

RORSCHACH	So do I.  So do you.
DREIBERG	Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.

RORSCHACH	Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
DREIBERG	Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

DREIBERG	. . . That was quick.
RORSCHACH	Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.

DREIBERG	I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
RORSCHACH	Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
DREIBERG	What new information?
RORSCHACH	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 

RORSCHACH	CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
DREIBERG	What do you mean, frame-up?
RORSCHACH	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
DREIBERG	Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?

RORSCHACH	How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
DREIBERG	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

RORSCHACH	Where's Laurie?
DREIBERG	I don't think she's coming with us.

DREIBERG	We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
RORSCHACH	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
DREIBERG	Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
RORSCHACH	Coward.  Giving up.
DREIBERG	SHUT UP, Rorschach.

RORSCHACH	Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
DREIBERG	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

RORSCHACH	What happened?
DREIBERG	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
RORSCHACH	What caused it?
DREIBERG	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.

DREIBERG	Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
RORSCHACH	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
DREIBERG	Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --

RORSCHACH	. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
DREIBERG	Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

JON	I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
JANEY	With lots of ketchup?

JON	Nothing wrong with ketchup.
JANEY	Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
JON	Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
JANEY	We should get back --  What?
JON	Nothing.  What were you going to say?
JANEY	We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?

JANEY	Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
JON	Janey, will you marry me?

JON	I can fix it.
JANEY	-- What?
JON	My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.

VEIDT	Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
JUSTINE	Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
VEIDT	No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
JUSTINE	Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
VEIDT	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --

VEIDT	No comment.
JUSTINE	Did you know he was back on the streets?
VEIDT	I did not.  Now get out of my way!
JUSTINE	Isn't it true that you --

SCHMIDT	Their real names, please.
LAURIE	I don't know their real names.
SCHMIDT	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
LAURIE	I don't know their real names!
SCHMIDT	You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
LAURIE	Then why don't you ask him?!?

SCHMIDT	Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
LAURIE	What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?

SCHMIDT	I'm terribly sorry.
LAURIE	What does this mean?  What does it --
SCHMIDT	Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
LAURIE	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --

SCHMIDT	All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
LAURIE	Am I free to go?
SCHMIDT	You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
LAURIE	I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
SCHMIDT	Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
LAURIE	Jon??  You mean he's --
SCHMIDT	That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.

LAURIE	Adrian.
VEIDT	Laurie!  Good to see you.

LAURIE	Don't rub it in.  I live here.
VEIDT	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
LAURIE	He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.

LAURIE	Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
VEIDT	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
LAURIE	Please.

VEIDT	He's a little farther gone every time.
LAURIE	Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
VEIDT	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
LAURIE	I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
VEIDT	What about you?
LAURIE	I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.

VEIDT	Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
LAURIE	Maybe I'll do that.
VEIDT	I'm sorry about Blake.

MOLOCH	I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
RORSCHACH	Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
MOLOCH	You're making a big --

RORSCHACH	Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
MOLOCH	ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

MOLOCH	Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
RORSCHACH	Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
MOLOCH	CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
RORSCHACH	Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

RORSCHACH	Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
MOLOCH	No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.

RORSCHACH	New information.
VEIDT	Ever see one of these before?
RORSCHACH	Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
VEIDT	What is that ungodly smell?

RORSCHACH	Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
VEIDT	Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
RORSCHACH	Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.

RORSCHACH	Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
VEIDT	Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.

RORSCHACH	Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
VEIDT	No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.

RORSCHACH	Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
VEIDT	Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
