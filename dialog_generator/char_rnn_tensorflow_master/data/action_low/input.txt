BOB	You can ride like that?
COMANCHE TOM	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.

COMANCHE TOM	I think I may just go on to the reservation.
BOB	Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...

COMANCHE TOM	I couldn't lose him.
BOB	Jim Younger, I told you--

BOB	This is healing?
COMANCHE TOM	Sometimes a wound will kill.
BOB	Now you tell us.

COLE	Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
BOB	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!

BOB	He's smiling.
COLE	Never a good thing.

COLE	Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
BOB	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.

BOB	Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
COLE	That was two hours ago.

COLE	Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
BOB	Zee, I'm pleased you came.

COLE	Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
BOB	The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
COLE	I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.

COLE	These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
BOB	Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.

BOB	Uhh, yeah it does.
COLE	You stay out of this, Bob.

BOB	No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
COLE	How?
BOB	Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.

COLE	We got a problem here, brother?
BOB	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

COLE	That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
BOB	What?

BOB	This is the best score yet.
COLE	It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
BOB	That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
COLE	As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
BOB	Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
COLE	Leave me alone, Bob.

COLE	How'd they --
BOB	What have you done?
COLE	I ain't done --
BOB	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

COLE	Bob. I didn't...
BOB	Swear.
COLE	I swear --
BOB	Swear on Jimmy's grave.

BOB	I'm sorry, Cole.
COLE	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.

BOB	Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
COLE	He's not bad at it.
BOB	It's tougher than it looks.

BOB	My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
FRANK	I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.

FRANK	Yesterday.
BOB	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!

BOB	Corn gonna shoot at me?
FRANK	Nope.
BOB	Then I love it.

FRANK	Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
BOB	... Will Perry ...

BOB	Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
FRANK	Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.

BOB	They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
FRANK	Oh no...
BOB	He just lost his temper a little.

FRANK	Damn!
BOB	They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
FRANK	The Army can hang him.
BOB	Tomorrow.

JESSE	Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
BOB	Best damn plan I heard all war.

JESSE	How many of them did he kill?
BOB	Two.

JESSE	You have no shame.
BOB	Not yet. But I'm hoping.

BOB	But if we take their money and supplies...
JESSE	Exactly.

JESSE	All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
BOB	Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
JESSE	We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.

JESSE	The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk.
BOB	Hey!
JESSE	Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars.

JESSE	Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
BOB	One false move and I'll blow your heads off!

JESSE	Beg pardon?
BOB	You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!

JESSE	This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
BOB	Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.

BOB	The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
JESSE	You are a fine figure of a man.
BOB	Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
JESSE	He's been full of vinegar lately.
BOB	He's planning a job.
JESSE	What?
BOB	Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
JESSE	Tell me.

BURLY DETECTIVE	What?
JESSE	You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!

BURLY DETECTIVE	What you sayin' boy?
JESSE	I think I recognize you.
BURLY DETECTIVE	How?
JESSE	I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.

BURLY DETECTIVE	You shut up now, boy.
JESSE	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --

COLE	'Bout time you got here, buddy.
JESSE	What's going on?

COLE	Ride with me, cousin?
JESSE	I could use the walk.
COLE	Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!

COLE	Where you boys going?
JESSE	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.

JESSE	Home, boys. Back to our farms.
COLE	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.

JESSE	Hands off your hip, Cole.
COLE	You're not scared, are you?
JESSE	Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.

JESSE	Not now.
COLE	What is wrong with you?
JESSE	In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.

JESSE	You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
COLE	She got two of them.

JESSE	She had a moustache.
COLE	She was European!
JESSE	All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --

JESSE	Thanks for the help.
COLE	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
JESSE	The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
COLE	It was exciting.
JESSE	But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?

COLE	Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
JESSE	Yeah.

JESSE	This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
COLE	So what do we do, General Lee?
JESSE	Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.

COLE	I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
JESSE	Perfect, Cole.
COLE	Let's ride.

COLE	The James-Younger Gang.
JESSE	Sorry.
COLE	Don't let it happen again.

JESSE	I got seven thousand.
COLE	I got three.

JESSE	See, Frank's being smart about this.
COLE	Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.

COLE	It's not a bank.
JESSE	It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.

JESSE	The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men.
COLE	Twenty?!

COLE	Jesse, we got to have a word.
JESSE	Sure, cousin.
COLE	All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
JESSE	Yep.
COLE	Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.

COLE	This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
JESSE	Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.

COLE	It'll be the biggest score yet.
JESSE	What will be?

JESSE	Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
COLE	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
JESSE	What are you saying?
COLE	I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
JESSE	You're forgetting who's in charge --

JESSE	Beautiful.
COLE	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
JESSE	A bad idea.
COLE	I got us through the War all right.
JESSE	And almost got hanged in peacetime.
COLE	That's it.

COLE	I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
JESSE	And I'm the better outlaw.

JESSE	Still smells fishy.
COLE	Then let me run the show, General Lee.

JESSE	Fine. We hit this bank.
COLE	You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!

COLE	Dammit!
JESSE	A trap.

JESSE	Okay, you're gonna rest here.
COLE	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!

COLE	Bob, rip up some bandages.
JESSE	Pass me some whisky.

COLE	We'll make them pay for this.
JESSE	I'm out.
COLE	WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
JESSE	Who's next? You? Me? Bob?

COLE	Missed you, cousin.
JESSE	Missed you too, cousin.

COLE	You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
JESSE	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.

JESSE	Where'd you get all these riders?
COLE	We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

COLE	Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
COMANCHE TOM	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.

COLE	Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
COMANCHE TOM	You ride like a Comanche.

COLE	Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
COMANCHE TOM	Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
COLE	Well?
COMANCHE TOM	I'm thinking...

FRANK	Cannon or Gatling?
COLE	Both would be nice.
FRANK	Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.

COLE	What the --
FRANK	Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.

FRANK	I think one of 'em's glass.
COLE	Which one, right or left?
FRANK	The brown one.

FRANK	Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
COLE	Sadie was not a man!

COLE	I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
FRANK	Shakespeare.  He's European.
COLE	Ah.

COLE	BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
FRANK	Get buckets!

COLE	Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
FRANK	Strategically.
COLE	-- Exactly. Because this is a war.

FRANK	Jesse.
COLE	Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
FRANK	Cole, he didn't mean that.

FRANK	Another dozen out back.
COLE	They gonna rush us?
FRANK	They're just insurance in case we run.

COLE	The safe. Now.
TELLER	Of course!  Uh, sir?
COLE	What?
TELLER	Where is Jesse James?
COLE	This here is the Younger Gang!

COLE	OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
TELLER	All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...

COMANCHE TOM	You 'um big lawman?
MARSHALL	Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
COMANCHE TOM	Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
MARSHALL	The District Marshall

MARSHALL	Of St. Louis?
COMANCHE TOM	Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
MARSHALL	East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
COMANCHE TOM	Ho-yah!

MARSHALL	Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
COMANCHE TOM	Me get heap firewater --

OLD MAN	I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
COMANCHE TOM	You're right, sir.
OLD MAN	Then why can't I go in there?
COMANCHE TOM	On account of we're robbing it.
OLD MAN	Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
COMANCHE TOM	It's a secret.
OLD MAN	Fine. I'll just wait here.
COMANCHE TOM	I'd appreciate that.

SHERRIFF	What the --
DEPUTY	What is it?
SHERRIFF	Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
DEPUTY	So?
SHERRIFF	When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?

SHERRIFF	Where the hell were you?
DEPUTY	I had you covered.  From back there.
SHERRIFF	Shit.

JESSE	-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
DOC MIMMS	My little Web did that?
JESSE	Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.

DOC MIMMS	Web died fighting?
JESSE	Died a hero.

DOC MIMMS	Boys...
JESSE	Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.

JESSE	What do you say, sir?
DOC MIMMS	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.

DOC MIMMS	You know you're welcome any time!
JESSE	Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
DOC MIMMS	It's fine by me, Jesse.

ZEE	Daddy, don't start with this again.
DOC MIMMS	Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?

ZEE	He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
DOC MIMMS	The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.

DOC MIMMS	They're gone. What are you --
ZEE	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
DOC MIMMS	Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
ZEE	I think he's already feeling better.

ZEE	He thinks this is some kind of game!
DOC MIMMS	I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.

FRANK	Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
JESSE	So we got a plan?

JESSE	Distracting enough for you?
FRANK	Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
JESSE	So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
FRANK	Mm-hmm.
JESSE	Such as?
FRANK	You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
JESSE	That would have made an impression.
FRANK	I figure.
JESSE	See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
FRANK	No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.

JESSE	Web's dead.
FRANK	I reckoned.
JESSE	Hell of a war.
FRANK	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

FRANK	Hello, Liberty Missoura!
JESSE	All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.

JESSE	Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
FRANK	We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.

JESSE	Frank, don't you have something to say?
FRANK	You're doing just fine.
JESSE	Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.

FRANK	Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
JESSE	Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.

JESSE	All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
FRANK	Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
JESSE	What kind of story are they going to believe?

JESSE	That just might work.
FRANK	Maybe, maybe...

FRANK	Big and older?
JESSE	You can shut up now.
FRANK	You are a charmer.
JESSE	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
FRANK	Next time try "fat and haggard."

FRANK	She's still talking to Jesus.
JESSE	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.

JESSE	-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
FRANK	Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."

FRANK	You know him?
JESSE	Heard of him.

FRANK	I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
JESSE	Damn. All that reading paid off.

FRANK	You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
JESSE	What do you think?
FRANK	Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.

FRANK	You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
JESSE	Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?

FRANK	Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
JESSE	Ma.

FRANK	... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
JESSE	Don't care.
FRANK	Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
JESSE	Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.

FRANK	How'd it go in there?
JESSE	Fine. How'd it go out here?
FRANK	We're gonna have to talk...

JESSE	And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
FRANK	And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?

FRANK	And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
JESSE	And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.

JESSE	I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
FRANK	It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.

FRANK	Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
JESSE	Bob's upset.
FRANK	The posters?

FRANK	Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
JESSE	Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.

JESSE	This has been a good year.
FRANK	Jesse, we're outlaws.
JESSE	And we're good at it.
FRANK	It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
JESSE	You've killed your fair share of men.
FRANK	If I could go back to farming --
JESSE	That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
FRANK	I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
JESSE	We're doing this for Ma.
FRANK	Maybe it started out that way. But now...
JESSE	What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
FRANK	A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?

FRANK	We're drunk.
JESSE	Oh yeah.
FRANK	Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.

JESSE	You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
FRANK	No, I --

JESSE	They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
FRANK	Got any ideas, little brother?

JESSE	Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
FRANK	Jim was old enough...
JESSE	He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
FRANK	Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
JESSE	You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
FRANK	Yeah.
JESSE	A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
FRANK	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

FRANK	I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
JESSE	See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
FRANK	Hell, they hardly even noticed us.

JIMMY	Y'know, Uncle Frank...
FRANK	Yeah, Jimmy?
JIMMY	...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
FRANK	I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.

FRANK	Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
JIMMY	Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
FRANK	That he was.
JIMMY	They're making him a hero now.
FRANK	Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
JIMMY	But he killed a lot of men, too.
FRANK	Can't argue that.
JIMMY	So what was he?
FRANK	I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.

JIMMY	Uncle Frank?
FRANK	Yeah Jimmy?
JIMMY	How much of that story is true?
FRANK	Everything but the boring parts.

MA	Did you kill Yankees?
JESSE	A fair number, Ma.
MA	Say your prayers?

JESSE	Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
MA	He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.

JESSE	Easterners.
MA	We're just fine, thank you, sir.

MA	The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
JESSE	Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.

JESSE	Ma! Please!
MA	Boys?

MA	Riders --
JESSE	We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
MA	Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.

JESSE	Doc Mimms will --
MA	Shush.

JESSE	Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
ZEE	You were little Jesse James when you left.
JESSE	But you got big!

ZEE	But still died.
JESSE	If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.

ZEE	Jesse, are you awake?
JESSE	Mmmm.

ZEE	Jesse, is that your hand?
JESSE	Nuh-huh ...

ZEE	You shouldn't be up.
JESSE	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
ZEE	You're sick of my company?
JESSE	No! I mean, of course not. No.
ZEE	Teasing you is completely unfair.
JESSE	What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
ZEE	I shouldn't tease a hero.
JESSE	What?
ZEE	Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
JESSE	I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
ZEE	So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
JESSE	Unfair. You are completely unfair.

JESSE	I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
ZEE	You didn't want to farm?
JESSE	I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
ZEE	A river pirate.
JESSE	Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
ZEE	Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
JESSE	Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
ZEE	You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
JESSE	Not if I find the right girl.
ZEE	And what's this right girl like?
JESSE	Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
ZEE	Where will you find such a girl?
JESSE	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.

JESSE	Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
ZEE	Sparkling rocks?
JESSE	Little ones.
ZEE	Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
JESSE	Yep.
ZEE	Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
JESSE	I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.

ZEE	I am so sorry, Jesse.
JESSE	Frank and me have to go away for a while.

ZEE	You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
JESSE	Me neither.
ZEE	Let the law --
JESSE	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
ZEE	Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
JESSE	When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

JESSE	Zee.
ZEE	Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
JESSE	I had to see you. I'm getting married.

ZEE	I don't understand.
JESSE	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
ZEE	That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
JESSE	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.

ZEE	I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
JESSE	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
ZEE	Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
JESSE	I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
ZEE	Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.

ZEE	Hmm.
JESSE	Hmm what?
ZEE	But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James.

JESSE	I beg your pardon?
ZEE	Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James. Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
JESSE	Let me see that.
ZEE	Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
JESSE	Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
ZEE	Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
JESSE	Aw, shucks, ma'am...
ZEE	Stop it. This is just sad.
JESSE	Swimming. Swimming is good.

ZEE	Don't turn around.
JESSE	What?
ZEE	If you don't see it, it's not real...

ZEE	You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
JESSE	Yes ma'am.
ZEE	I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
JESSE	You are a hell of a woman.
ZEE	Don't swear.
JESSE	Yes ma'am.

ZEE	Tennessee?
JESSE	I'll explain on the way.

PINKERTON	We're moving you tomorrow.
JESSE	But I like the presidential suite.
PINKERTON	Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
JESSE	So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
PINKERTON	That's the idea.

JESSE	Did you order our houses burned down?
PINKERTON	Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

JESSE	You almost ended my career before it began.
PINKERTON	Pity.

PINKERTON	How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
JESSE	Last February?
PINKERTON	Mmm.
JESSE	You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
PINKERTON	Yes?
JESSE	The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
PINKERTON	Damn.

JESSE	Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
PINKERTON	I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
JESSE	No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.

PINKERTON	Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
JESSE	I figured.
PINKERTON	Was it worth it?
JESSE	Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
PINKERTON	That's what I would have done.
JESSE	I'm not hanged yet.
PINKERTON	You cocky little bastard.
JESSE	Ahh, you'll miss me.
PINKERTON	No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.

JESSE	That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
PINKERTON	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.

PINKERTON	The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
JESSE	Thanks.
PINKERTON	I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
JESSE	Fair enough.

PASTOR	This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
JESSE	You don't think God'll mind, do you?

PASTOR	The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
JESSE	I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
PASTOR	Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
JESSE	Thank you.
PASTOR	Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.

PASTOR	Now let's have a drink.
JESSE	Right here in church?
PASTOR	Communion.

JESSE	And you're too young.
JIM	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
JESSE	And the same age Web was. No.

JIM	I like that.
JESSE	No.

JIM	You okay, Jesse?
JESSE	Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
JIM	Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
JESSE	I guess so.
JIM	I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.

JESSE	Jim, you been with a girl yet?
JIM	Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

JIM	Well, not exactly.
JESSE	You been with a girl ever?
JIM	Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
JESSE	I think so.
JIM	You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
JESSE	I swear.
JIM	Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
JESSE	You do that.

JESSE	What about that Rock Island bastard?
JIM	It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?

JIM	... too young for whisky...
JESSE	This time we'll make an exception.
JIM	Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
JESSE	You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.

JIM	Why, yeah.
LYLA	I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
JIM	Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
LYLA	Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.

JIM	Really?
LYLA	I hope I'm not being too forward.
JIM	Not at all.
LYLA	I just though you were awful cute.
JIM	Thank you, Miss -- ?
LYLA	Lyla Devereux.
JIM	Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
LYLA	Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
JIM	Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
LYLA	That is so gentlemanly of you.

JIM	Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
LYLA	Really?
JIM	Don't talk about it much, though.

PINKERTON	Well, this land is about to be condemned.
PARKER	I'm doing you folks a favor --

PARKER	Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
PINKERTON	It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.

PINKERTON	My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
PARKER	They had to be dealt with!
PINKERTON	By burning down their homes?

PARKER	How can that be?
PINKERTON	They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.

PARKER	There's only four of them...
PINKERTON	Move you fools!

PARKER	Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
RAINS	And it is my pleasure to be here.
PARKER	Really!
RAINS	NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
PARKER	I can completely understand your distress, sir.

RAINS	Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
PARKER	Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
RAINS	Good.
PARKER	Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
RAINS	Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
PARKER	Yes sir.
RAINS	Just perfect.
PARKER	A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
RAINS	You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
PARKER	I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
RAINS	I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.

PARKER	They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
RAINS	How much did they get from the safe?
PARKER	Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
RAINS	I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
PARKER	To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
RAINS	THEN WHO DID?!
PARKER	We did.

PARKER	Your men knew the risks.
RAINS	What is going on here, man?

RAINS	With my money!
PARKER	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!

PARKER	The final route for the railroad is complete.
RAINS	I look forward to seeing it.

RAINS	Parker.
PARKER	Sir?
RAINS	What is that?
PARKER	What, sir?

RAINS	That.
PARKER	Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.

RAINS	This is him.
PARKER	I remember you.

PARKER	How did you know?
RAINS	Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?

RAINS	Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
PINKERTON	Not to mention my men who lost their lives.

RAINS	You wouldn't have done that?
PINKERTON	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
RAINS	I want them arrested and hanged!
PINKERTON	Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
RAINS	This is no game.
PINKERTON	I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.

RAINS	A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West.
PINKERTON	It is a nice piece of writing.
RAINS	The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
PINKERTON	Oh, that's the best part.

PINKERTON	It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
RAINS	I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
PINKERTON	Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
RAINS	So you can't tell me anything?
PINKERTON	It's going to be a long winter.

RAINS	Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
PINKERTON	All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.

PINKERTON	First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
RAINS	I can't believe this.
PINKERTON	And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.

PINKERTON	Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
RAINS	I demand action.
PINKERTON	No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
RAINS	Can't you tell me anything?
PINKERTON	It's going to be a long spring.

RAINS	So he's won.
PINKERTON	No.

PINKERTON	Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
RAINS	In English, Pinkerton.
PINKERTON	There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
RAINS	Can you put men at all four?
PINKERTON	No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
RAINS	What is that?
PINKERTON	Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.

RAINS	What the hell is that sound?
PINKERTON	Vengeance.

BAILEY	We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
STEED	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
BAILEY	Really?
STEED	Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
BAILEY	Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
STEED	Seriously?
BAILEY	Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
STEED	You don't say. How real does it feel?
BAILEY	As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
STEED	There are limits?
BAILEY	The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
STEED	No need. I'll call again.

DR. DARLING	I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
EMMA	... bottle ...
DR. DARLING	Red ...
EMMA	... head ...

EMMA	Knight ...
DR. DARLING	Black...
EMMA	... death ...
DR. DARLING	Love...
EMMA	... death ...

DR. DARLING	Flower ...
EMMA	... power ...

DR. DARLING	Nature ...
EMMA	... preserve...
DR. DARLING	Secret ...
EMMA	... love...
DR. DARLING	Hope...
EMMA	... love ...
DR. DARLING	Fear ...
EMMA	... love ...
DR. DARLING	Peter ...

EMMA	How long have I been here?
DR. DARLING	Three days.

DR. DARLING	He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
EMMA	So I'm still ...

EMMA	Would that I could say the Same.
DR. DARLING	Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...

EMMA	I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
SIR AUGUST	You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.

EMMA	I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
SIR AUGUST	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

SIR AUGUST	You
EMMA	Have we met?
SIR AUGUST	You mean you don't recall??

SIR AUGUST	Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
EMMA	Promised? Who promised?
SIR AUGUST	There, look!

SIR AUGUST	Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
EMMA	Sir August...?  What now?

PORTER	May I help you, madam ...
EMMA	Mr. John Steed, please.
PORTER	I'm afraid that's impossible.
EMMA	Impossible?

PORTER	You are female?
EMMA	As you see.
PORTER	Then you can't come in.
EMMA	I have an appointment.
PORTER	No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
EMMA	Really -- what happened in 1922?

EMMA	Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
VOICE	Eh? In here!

EMMA	Quite a collection.
VOICE	If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.

EMMA	Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
VOICE	We have met ...

VOICE	Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
EMMA	This isn't a game.
VOICE	Quite right, but we still make the rules.
EMMA	Rules are made to be broken.
VOICE	People, too.
EMMA	Then who wins?
VOICE	You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...

MOTHER	Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
EMMA	Hmmm ...
MOTHER	Looks like rain, Steed...

MOTHER	My number two. Special assignments. She's --
EMMA	Let me guess -- 'Father'?

EMMA	How curious ...
MOTHER	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.

MOTHER	Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
EMMA	Ropes?

MOTHER	Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
EMMA	He tried to warn us ...

MOTHER	Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
EMMA	Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

MOTHER	London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
EMMA	After the cold war ...

EMMA	I resign.
MOTHER	You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
EMMA	Watch me.

EMMA	What are you trying to do to me?
MOTHER	We want to help...!
EMMA	I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
MOTHER	The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
EMMA	To you ... ?

MOTHER	Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
EMMA	The Institute ... the funding ...
MOTHER	A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...

EMMA	Who?
MOTHER	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

MOTHER	This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
EMMA	To find out who killed my husband.
MOTHER	The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
EMMA	So am I.

MOTHER	About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	Next assignment?

MOTHER	Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
EMMA	Thank you, Steed.

VALENTINE	Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
EMMA	Thanks, Valentine ...

EMMA	You.
VALENTINE	Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...

VALENTINE	A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
EMMA	Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
VALENTINE	An unholy trinity ...
EMMA	You killed my husband.
VALENTINE	For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
EMMA	Too many cooks --
VALENTINE	Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
EMMA	But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
VALENTINE	Of course. I planned that, too.
EMMA	But -- why?
VALENTINE	You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
EMMA	'Our revels now are ended.'
VALENTINE	Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...

VALENTINE	Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
EMMA	I'm already married ...
VALENTINE	Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

VALENTINE	You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
EMMA	Valentine, listen to me ...
VALENTINE	Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
EMMA	Ring?

VALENTINE	That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
EMMA	You're mad.
VALENTINE	Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --

EMMA	Such as?
VALENTINE	Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
EMMA	The result would be ...
VALENTINE	Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
EMMA	Then what's stopping you?
VALENTINE	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

VALENTINE	The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
EMMA	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
VALENTINE	Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
EMMA	What are my choices?
VALENTINE	Choices?
EMMA	I'll never marry you.

STEED	Doctor Peel, I presume?
EMMA	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.

STEED	I was about to throw in the towel.
EMMA	I had a spot of bother at the door.
STEED	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
EMMA	1922. Why the kippers?
STEED	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
EMMA	So what was all this -- some sort of test?
STEED	Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
EMMA	Whereas you are.
STEED	Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
EMMA	Rules are made to be broken.
STEED	Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
EMMA	And just what is the game?
STEED	I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
EMMA	Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
STEED	Much better.
EMMA	And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
STEED	I didn't. Mother did.
EMMA	Mother?

STEED	... Showers followed by sunny periods.
EMMA	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.

STEED	Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
EMMA	A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?

EMMA	My father always wanted a boy.
STEED	Really?  I fail to see the connection.
EMMA	I had a feeling you would. Touche!

EMMA	Do you?
STEED	Yes indeed. I need protection.

EMMA	I thought we were on our way.
STEED	Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
EMMA	Or half cocked.

EMMA	Steed, we really must be --
STEED	Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?

EMMA	You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
STEED	Thank you, Trubshaw ...

EMMA	That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
STEED	Do you really think so?

EMMA	You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
STEED	Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

EMMA	But why? What's the point?
STEED	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
EMMA	And I suppose you're the knight.
STEED	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
EMMA	That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.

EMMA	Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
STEED	As per mother's instructions.
EMMA	Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
STEED	For a man in my position --
EMMA	Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
STEED	They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
EMMA	I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
STEED	After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
EMMA	No thanks.
STEED	I meant me.

STEED	According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
EMMA	An eccentric recluse?

STEED	Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
EMMA	June, July ... August?
STEED	The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
EMMA	Any other vices?
STEED	All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.

EMMA	So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
STEED	Small talk.  Try the weather.

STEED	Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
EMMA	You should be dead.  How do you feel?
STEED	Strange.
EMMA	You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
STEED	I wasn't about to.
EMMA	I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
STEED	I might say the same.

EMMA	Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
STEED	Why should they think that?
EMMA	You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
STEED	Frankly that's how I remember it.
EMMA	But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
STEED	Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA	That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
STEED	Did he say who?
EMMA	No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.

STEED	An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
EMMA	Did you say formal? I must dress.

STEED	I must say, you look more your old self --
EMMA	You mean my other self ...
STEED	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
EMMA	I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.

STEED	Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
EMMA	How on earth can you tell?

STEED	Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
EMMA	Very good, Steed ...

STEED	What on earth?
EMMA	Any ideas?
STEED	Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
EMMA	Is that written in his shoe?
STEED	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	She had this in her mouth. There, there...

STEED	For you, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA	Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

EMMA	But
STEED	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

EMMA	Not quite. This is my field.
STEED	Is there anything that isn't?
EMMA	The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
STEED	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
EMMA	Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
STEED	But if someone miniaturized the process...
EMMA	That's what we were working on.
STEED	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.

EMMA	Three agents killed by bad weather...
STEED	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
STEED	... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
EMMA	Not that I know of.  Explanation?
STEED	According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

EMMA	Is that what you think?
STEED	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

STEED	Do you always drive this fast?
EMMA	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

STEED	What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
EMMA	Barely.
STEED	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?

EMMA	This must be the last straw.
STEED	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
EMMA	Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
STEED	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

EMMA	Steed ... !
STEED	Mrs. Peel ... ?

EMMA	Where am I?
STEED	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
EMMA	Was I?
STEED	I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
EMMA	It was Peter -- I saw him ...

EMMA	You followed me.
STEED	Orders.
EMMA	To kill me?
STEED	Nothing personal.

EMMA	I could save you the trouble.
STEED	No trouble.
EMMA	Because you always obey orders ...
STEED	Always.  Except ...

EMMA	Yes ... ?
STEED	... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

EMMA	And do you trust me?
STEED	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
EMMA	It wasn't me; you have my word.

EMMA	Mmm ... what are you doing?
STEED	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
EMMA	Is that all?

EMMA	But you did suspect me.
STEED	Not for a moment.
EMMA	You're playing games.
STEED	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
EMMA	I thought you played by the rules.
STEED	I thought you didn't.
EMMA	I'm playing to win.
STEED	Winning isn't everything.
EMMA	Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
STEED	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

EMMA	No, after you.
STEED	You don't trust me?
EMMA	As far as you trust me.

STEED	I told Mother I took care of you.
EMMA	You lied.
STEED	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

STEED	Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
EMMA	No idea who. No idea why ...
STEED	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
EMMA	... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
STEED	Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
EMMA	Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.

STEED	Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
EMMA	I'm a wanted woman, I know ...

STEED	His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
EMMA	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
STEED	You'll find out.

EMMA	Aren't you coming?
STEED	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.

STEED	We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
STEED	You didn't tell her?

STEED	There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
EMMA	Have we been invited?

STEED	What's that you're wearing?
EMMA	It's called Black Leather.
STEED	Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.

EMMA	What is it?
STEED	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
EMMA	When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
STEED	You first.
EMMA	Shall we?

EMMA	Trubshaw again? What now?
STEED	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.

STEED	They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA	'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?

STEED	Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
EMMA	Have a look at this.

STEED	I'll be back ...
EMMA	Where are you going?
STEED	Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
EMMA	You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
STEED	No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
EMMA	But --
STEED	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
EMMA	If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --

STEED	Mrs. Peel?
EMMA	What kept you?
STEED	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...

STEED	'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
EMMA	'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
STEED	A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	Still a bit chilly ...
STEED	English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
EMMA	Have you any place in mind?
STEED	As a matter of fact I have ...

EMMA	I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
STEED	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA	Our little paradise -- just made for two?
STEED	Not quite.

STEED	Our chaperon.
EMMA	Pity your mother came, too ...

EMMA	Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
STEED	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

FATHER	Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
EMMA	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

FATHER	Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
EMMA	You're saying I have no choice.

EMMA	Where's Mother?
FATHER	Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...

EMMA	You don't believe him?
FATHER	It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.

FATHER	Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
EMMA	Decontamination -- ?
FATHER	And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.

INVISIBLE JONES	Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
EMMA	I see.
INVISIBLE JONES	Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?

INVISIBLE JONES	Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
EMMA	Peter's brother?  But --
INVISIBLE JONES	Half-brother to be precise.

INVISIBLE JONES	Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
EMMA	I know all this.
INVISIBLE JONES	Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
EMMA	Surveillance? By whom?
INVISIBLE JONES	Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
EMMA	Who's now vanished.
INVISIBLE JONES	Makes two of us.
EMMA	Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.

INVISIBLE JONES	I was getting to it.
EMMA	Getting to what?
INVISIBLE JONES	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
EMMA	I fail to see --

INVISIBLE JONES	Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
EMMA	Well, I can't possibly go like this.

INVISIBLE JONES	'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
EMMA	... and now?

INVISIBLE JONES	Privately owned by ...
EMMA	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
INVISIBLE JONES	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA	I shall need a small plane.
INVISIBLE JONES	You're not venturing alone, surely.
EMMA	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?

FATHER	A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
STEED	Global warming?
FATHER	Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

STEED	We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
FATHER	So you say ...

STEED	Oh, hello ...
FATHER	We want Mrs. Peel.
STEED	Dead, I'm afraid.

FATHER	Steed
STEED	How did you guess?
FATHER	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
STEED	It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.

FATHER	Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
STEED	Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...

STEED	Mother. I thought you were burglars.
MOTHER	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

MOTHER	Weather's turning nasty.
STEED	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
MOTHER	Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.

MOTHER	Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
STEED	Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --

STEED	Think she really killed those agents?
MOTHER	She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
STEED	Amnesia?
MOTHER	Possibly. Split personality ...
STEED	Insane ... ?
MOTHER	Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
STEED	Why?
MOTHER	She may try to kill you.

MOTHER	Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
STEED	How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?

MOTHER	Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
STEED	Anyone particular in mind?
MOTHER	You.

STEED	We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
MOTHER	Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
STEED	Impossible.

MOTHER	This man -- did you see him?
STEED	No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.

STEED	You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
MOTHER	Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...

MOTHER	Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
STEED	Guilty until proven innocent?
MOTHER	Mother and Father know best.

STEED	I was hoping you could tell me.
MOTHER	You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
STEED	I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
MOTHER	Where?
STEED	In your operation.
MOTHER	I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

OLD LADY	Are you alright, young man?
STEED	I think so, thank you so much ...

OLD LADY	Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
STEED	I feel sure of it.
OLD LADY	I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
STEED	She was ...

OLD LADY	You with Mother or Father?
STEED	Both, actually.
OLD LADY	Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
STEED	You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...

STEED	Wonderland Weather Ltd.
OLD LADY	This way ...

SIR AUGUST	Mrs. Peel -- ?
VOICE	Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
SIR AUGUST	No, please! I beg you ...
VOICE	Walk over to the window ...
SIR AUGUST	Let it be rain, please let it be --
VOICE	Stay by the window. By the window.

VALENTINE	John Steed.
STEED	Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
VALENTINE	The last one you'll ever see.
STEED	Perish the thought.

VALENTINE	You're better than I expected.
STEED	I was at Harrow ...
VALENTINE	But did they teach you this?

STEED	Bang-bang ... you're dead.
VALENTINE	You wish.

STEED	One shot -- for emergencies.
VALENTINE	That's not playing by the rules.
STEED	Rules are made to be broken.
VALENTINE	If you say so.
STEED	I do.

VALENTINE	You said ... one shot.
STEED	Did I? My mistake.

VALENTINE	Aren't you forgetting about something?
STEED	You are, and it's behind you.
VALENTINE	Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --

STEED	I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
VALENTINE	Ugh ...

BLONDE	Who are you?
MAX	Bruno's girlfriend.
BLONDE	Oh, yeah?
MAX	Yeah.
BLONDE	But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
MAX	No?
BLONDE	No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.

MAX	Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
BLONDE	How I make my living, what's your point?
MAX	This.

BRUNO	Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
MAX	I'm on a break.
BRUNO	Guess again.

BRUNO	No wire.
MAX	Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.

BRUNO	Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
MAX	Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.

BRUNO	Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
MAX	Yeah, sure, I understand.

BRUNO	I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
MAX	Yeah?

BRUNO	You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
MAX	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.

BRUNO	Man, you got a bad attitude.
MAX	I like to keep it professional, that's all.

BRUNO	Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
MAX	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
BRUNO	What?
MAX	That's not why we're here.
BRUNO	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.

BRUNO	Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
MAX	You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.

MAX	See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
BRUNO	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.

MAX	You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
BRUNO	What're you talkin' about?
MAX	I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
BRUNO	That's a lotta crap.
MAX	Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
BRUNO	How come I never hearda you before?
MAX	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.

MAX	This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
BRUNO	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
MAX	He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.

MAX	Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
BRUNO	What the hell are you doing?
MAX	Who's Camille?
BRUNO	None of your business.
MAX	This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.

KENDRA	Some of us are trying to sleep.
DARREN	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
KENDRA	You know each other?

DARREN	Nothing happened between me and Tia.
KENDRA	Leave.  Now.
DARREN	Can I say something in my defense?
KENDRA	No.

KENDRA	Move it.
DARREN	Where?

DARREN	How're ya doin', Max.
ORIGINAL CINDY	You mean until you showed up?
DARREN	You're not still pissed?

ORIGINAL CINDY	'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
DARREN	Justine was not an unwilling participant.

DARREN	Do you know why I went after Justine?
ORIGINAL CINDY	She was there...
DARREN	Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
ORIGINAL CINDY	And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
DARREN	Could you give us a moment.

MAX	Why would I be pissed?
DARREN	It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.

DARREN	I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
MAX	I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
DARREN	I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.

DARREN	What are you doing here?
MAX	I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
DARREN	You're roommates?

DARREN	What is it?
MAX	Police drone.

MAX	It's a sweep.  C'mon.
DARREN	What?  Where're we going?

DARREN	Lemme put some clothes on.
MAX	No time.

MAX	Out there.
DARREN	No way.
MAX	Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.

DARREN	But I'm afraid of--
MAX	Don't look down.

HERBAL	Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
NORMAL	So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
HERBAL	Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."

NORMAL	Which is none of your business...or mine.
HERBAL	It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
NORMAL	Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.

NORMAL	What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
HERBAL	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.

INGA	Where'd you clip this?
MAX	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
INGA	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
MAX	Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
INGA	Same old story.  Not interested.
MAX	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.

INGA	What're you looking for?
MAX	A grand.
INGA	Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
MAX	I ain't mad at you...
INGA	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
MAX	Later.

INGA	I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
MAX	I don't get involved with guns.
INGA	I'll make it worth your while.
MAX	It's a rule.

MAX	You're light a deuce.
INGA	Am I?

INGA	So Max, what do you do with all your money?
MAX	I got overhead...

MAX	I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
KENDRA	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
MAX	Yeah, me too.

MAX	He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
KENDRA	Yech...

KENDRA	What a creep.
MAX	And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.

KENDRA	What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
MAX	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
KENDRA	You didn't...
MAX	Every week.

LAUREN	Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
MAX	SHHH!  Don't do that!

MAX	Damn... Are you alright?
LAUREN	They took my daughter.
MAX	I know.
LAUREN	I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...

MAX	Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
LAUREN	Can you help me get her back?
MAX	Look, I'd really like to...

LAUREN	If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
MAX	We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
LAUREN	What else can we do?
MAX	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.

MAX	Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
LAUREN	Hello...
MAX	Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.

LAUREN	Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
SOPHY	I don't want to move away.
LAUREN	I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
SOPHY	But why can't we stay here?
LAUREN	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
SOPHY	Are we in some kind of trouble?
LAUREN	No...
SOPHY	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?

LAUREN	What makes you cry?
SOPHY	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
LAUREN	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
SOPHY	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.

LAUREN	Sophy?  Are you okay?
SOPHY	Mommy, where are you?
LAUREN	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
SOPHY	When?
LAUREN	Soon, baby.
SOPHY	Mommy, I'm scared.
LAUREN	There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.

LOGAN	You're a thief?
MAX	Girl's gotta make a living.
LOGAN	Thank God.
MAX	First time I ever heard that.
LOGAN	I was expecting someone else.
MAX	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
LOGAN	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.

MAX	I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
LOGAN	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.

LOGAN	You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
MAX	Whoever that is.
LOGAN	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
MAX	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
LOGAN	Who is...
MAX	The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.

MAX	So this guy walks into a bar and says...
LOGAN	We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.

MAX	Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
LOGAN	Logan Cale.

MAX	Sorry about your window.
LOGAN	Can we go somewhere and talk?

MAX	Lemme get my coat.
LOGAN	The one you're wearing?

MAX	How'd you find me?
LOGAN	Wasn't that hard.
MAX	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
LOGAN	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
MAX	So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
LOGAN	Too early to tell.
MAX	How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
LOGAN	Lauren's not my wife.
MAX	Girlfriend?
LOGAN	One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
MAX	What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
LOGAN	Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
MAX	So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
LOGAN	Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
MAX	You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
LOGAN	People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
MAX	So what are you gonna do about it?
LOGAN	Something.
MAX	Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
LOGAN	You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
MAX	Is the social studies class over for today?
LOGAN	Yeah...

LOGAN	Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
MAX	I won't be staying.
LOGAN	I'm not a half bad cook.

MAX	Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
LOGAN	It was open.
MAX	You got a lotta nerve.
LOGAN	Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
MAX	Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
LOGAN	Bent?
MAX	Bent.
LOGAN	You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
MAX	How do I know you didn't?
LOGAN	So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
MAX	Am I s'posed to be grateful?
LOGAN	That would be appropriate, yes.
MAX	How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
LOGAN	You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.

MAX	Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
LOGAN	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
MAX	We are not fine.

LOGAN	Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
MAX	Yes on all counts.
LOGAN	I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
MAX	You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
LOGAN	I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
MAX	You need to get out more.
LOGAN	C'mere, I want to show you something.

MAX	Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
LOGAN	No, I meant this.

MAX	Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
LOGAN	Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.

LOGAN	Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
MAX	The other ones?
LOGAN	The other one like you...
MAX	You lost me.
LOGAN	C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.

LOGAN	L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
MAX	You did go through my stuff.

MAX	I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
LOGAN	He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
MAX	Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
LOGAN	The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.

MAX	We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
LOGAN	How well do you remember the lab?
MAX	I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
LOGAN	How much do you know?
MAX	I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
LOGAN	The technical term for you is "chimera"...
MAX	Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
LOGAN	A girl.
MAX	Your basic hodge-podge.
LOGAN	Hardly...

MAX	Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
LOGAN	Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
MAX	You said you could help.
LOGAN	I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
MAX	What's in it for you?
LOGAN	Your help.
MAX	I already don't like the sound of this.
LOGAN	The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
MAX	That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
LOGAN	She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
MAX	Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
LOGAN	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
MAX	I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
LOGAN	She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
MAX	They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.

MAX	They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
LOGAN	You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
MAX	That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.

MAX	See you're back and still rocking the boat.
LOGAN	Somebody's got to.

MAX	I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
LOGAN	Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
MAX	I'm sorry.
LOGAN	My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
MAX	You believe that?
LOGAN	I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
MAX	Well, not me personally.
LOGAN	On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
MAX	That's what soldiers do, right?

MAX	What's this?
LOGAN	Open it.

LOGAN	It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
MAX	I don't know what to say.
LOGAN	Deeds, not words.  I need your help.

LOGAN	Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
MAX	Look, thank you for this but--

LOGAN	These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
MAX	And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
LOGAN	You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
MAX	We're quoting Mom again.
LOGAN	Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
MAX	And you still think you can do something to change that.
LOGAN	With your help.
MAX	Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
LOGAN	And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.

LOGAN	That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
MAX	Zack... He made it... He's alive...

LOGAN	I'm looking for a lady who works here.
NORMAL	Ladies would be elsewhere.

LOGAN	Know where I can find her?
NORMAL	You don't want to.
LOGAN	But she does work here?
NORMAL	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
LOGAN	I need to talk to her.
NORMAL	Can't help you.

NORMAL	Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
LOGAN	Any idea when she'll be back?
NORMAL	None.
LOGAN	I'll wait.

MAX	Who is it?
LYDIA	A friend of your fiance's.
MAX	What do you want?
LYDIA	To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

MAX	Who are you?
LYDIA	My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
MAX	You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
LYDIA	With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
MAX	How do I know you're telling the truth?
LYDIA	He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
MAX	Look, I don't know what you want--
LYDIA	I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
MAX	And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
LYDIA	Oh?
MAX	Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
LYDIA	How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
MAX	Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
LYDIA	You're also a fool.
MAX	I think you should go now.
LYDIA	Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.

MAX	This is not a place you wanna go.
LYDIA	Let go of my hand.

LYDIA	Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
MAX	Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
LYDIA	Okay, okay.

MAX	Say the words, "I understand."
LYDIA	I understand.
MAX	And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...

VOGELSANG	I asked you to keep that thing outside.
MAX	You did.
VOGELSANG	You drive away business roarin' in like that.
MAX	Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
VOGELSANG	You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
MAX	My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
VOGELSANG	Right here someplace.

VOGELSANG	I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
MAX	Sorry, I was seven at the time.

MAX	Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
VOGELSANG	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
MAX	Thank you.
VOGELSANG	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.

VOGELSANG	Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
MAX	Then what?
VOGELSANG	Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
MAX	Nothing on Hannah?
VOGELSANG	A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...

MAX	She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
VOGELSANG	Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.

MAX	What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
VOGELSANG	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
MAX	You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
VOGELSANG	Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
MAX	More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.

MAX	As long as you're okay.
VOGELSANG	I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.

VOGELSANG	I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
MAX	Here's your money.

VOGELSANG	Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
MAX	How's this about me?
VOGELSANG	They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
MAX	Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
VOGELSANG	Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
MAX	You're crazy.
VOGELSANG	I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.

VOGELSANG	Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
MAX	Bastard...

VOGELSANG	I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
MAX	You and me both.

MAX	I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
VOGELSANG	Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
MAX	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...

MAX	Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
VOGELSANG	Got a pencil?
MAX	Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
VOGELSANG	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
MAX	I'm on my way.

MAX	Morning, Sunshine...
ORIGINAL CINDY	Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
MAX	At least he didn't swing with your ride.
ORIGINAL CINDY	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?

ORIGINAL CINDY	Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
MAX	Straight.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?

ORIGINAL CINDY	Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
MAX	What guys do.  'Nother order.
ORIGINAL CINDY	You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
MAX	I just don't go in with any expectations.

MAX	That's odd...
ORIGINAL CINDY	What?

MAX	Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
ORIGINAL CINDY	You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
MAX	No.
ORIGINAL CINDY	He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
MAX	Yeah.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
MAX	A little what?
ORIGINAL CINDY	You know what I'm saying.
MAX	If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
ORIGINAL CINDY	How long you and me known each other?
MAX	A long time.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
MAX	Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
ORIGINAL CINDY	And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
MAX	A fog bank.
ORIGINAL CINDY	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...

MAX	Gotta go.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Where?
MAX	It's a secret.

ORIGINAL CINDY	You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
MAX	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Unlikely.
MAX	And because he's my friend.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Friends don't help other friends cheat.
MAX	And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Please...
MAX	They're prisoners to their genes.
ORIGINAL CINDY	So are dogs.
MAX	They don't have a lot of moving parts.
ORIGINAL CINDY	Only one I can think of.
MAX	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
ORIGINAL CINDY	I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
MAX	But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.

MAX	Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
SONRISA	I'll bet you can.  Sit.

MAX	Not right now.
SONRISA	Not right now?  Okay, when?
MAX	Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
SONRISA	Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
MAX	Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
SONRISA	I actually know how this works.
MAX	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...

SONRISA	Who are you?
MAX	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?

MAX	Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
SONRISA	Pull the cash.

SONRISA	So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
MAX	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
SONRISA	And she bought that?
MAX	I have sincere eyes.

SONRISA	Make the call.
MAX	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
SONRISA	She's got my word.
MAX	She's gonna want to hear for herself.

MAX	Can you put that in a bag or something?
SONRISA	You get it when I get her.
MAX	Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.

MAX	It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
THEO	You're the best, Maxie.

MAX	Playing hooky again?
THEO	Feel like the dog's dinner.
MAX	Probably a touch of what's going around.
THEO	I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.

MAX	Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
THEO	What if he's on the level?
MAX	Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
THEO	Tell everybody hey.
MAX	You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.

MAX	Catch you back at the wall.
SKETCHY	Later.

MAX	Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
SKETCHY	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
MAX	Right, the big one-oh.
SKETCHY	But I'll take a rain check...

MAX	Hey, Sketchy--
SKETCHY	We gotta talk.
MAX	What's up?

MAX	You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
SKETCHY	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.

MAX	I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
SKETCHY	I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
MAX	Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
SKETCHY	Max--
MAX	Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
SKETCHY	Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
MAX	You left out condescending.
SKETCHY	But there's another side--
MAX	Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
SKETCHY	I'm the victim here.
MAX	Really?
SKETCHY	Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
MAX	And you were a sympathetic ear.
SKETCHY	Exactly.
MAX	Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
SKETCHY	She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
MAX	Does this person have a name?
SKETCHY	Lydia.
MAX	And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
SKETCHY	I'm a toy to her.
MAX	A toy?
SKETCHY	She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
MAX	Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
SKETCHY	Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
MAX	What happens if you level with her?
SKETCHY	Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
MAX	And why should she?
SKETCHY	Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.

SKETCHY	So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
MAX	You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
SKETCHY	She tells you how I've been--
MAX	--a philandering pig.
SKETCHY	But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
MAX	Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
SKETCHY	I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
MAX	How'd you get her out of town?
SKETCHY	Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
MAX	And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
SKETCHY	She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
MAX	I'll give it my best shot.
SKETCHY	Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
MAX	You don't.

SKETCHY	You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
MAX	Easy Sketchy.
SKETCHY	No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
MAX	Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
SKETCHY	She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
MAX	You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
SKETCHY	She was the one--
MAX	None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
SKETCHY	True, but--
MAX	You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
SKETCHY	Okay, okay, okay--
MAX	Say the words, "I understand."

SKETCHY	That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
MAX	Shut-up...

NORMAL	This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
MAX	I was on call. 
NORMAL	I want you on call here.
MAX	What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
NORMAL	More like deployed in bed asleep.
MAX	I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
NORMAL	And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
MAX	He's sick.
NORMAL	For a change.
MAX	How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.

NORMAL	You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
MAX	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.

NORMAL	Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
MAX	Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.

NORMAL	What about this?
MAX	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.

NORMAL	Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
MAX	Theo's dead.

ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.

BEN	How'd you know it was me?
ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?

BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
BEN	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...

BEN	Those yours too?
ALICIA	My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
BEN	I like the sound of that.

THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
THE THING	This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.

THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
THE THING	I mean...
ALICIA	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?

BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
SUE	I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

BEN	I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
SUE	Victor did.

SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
BEN	Is it safe?

SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
BEN	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?

BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
SUE	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

SUE	He didn't.
BEN	Oh, he did.
SUE	What did he do to the uniform?!

SUE	He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
BEN	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
SUE	No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.

SUE	Where is Reed?
BEN	Victor must've taken him.

BEN	What are you doing here?
VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
BEN	About me? How sweet.
VICTOR	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.

VICTOR	Ben, come in.
BEN	What is this? Where's Reed?
VICTOR	Where do you think? With Sue.

BEN	What do you want, Vic?
VICTOR	To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.

BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
VICTOR	He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.

VICTOR	He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
BEN	And you can? Power it up?

BEN	I'll be watching over you.
DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.

BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.

BEN	Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
DEBBIE	Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.

DEBBIE	Ben?
BEN	Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.

DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
BEN	Deb, it's me. It's still me.

DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
BEN	I already got it. Everything I want.

BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.

REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
BEN	You'd never know it.

BEN	I can't take this.
REED	Ben. This is business. Just work.

BEN	What about his first born?
REED	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.

BEN	He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
BEN	Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
REED	We got what we wanted. That's enough.
BEN	I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...

BEN	Can't do it. I cannot do it.
REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
BEN	No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
REED	Youthful high spirits.

BEN	They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.

REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
BEN	Five times.
REED	I had it at four.
BEN	This makes five.

BEN	Isn't that your speech?
REED	He's made a few changes.
BEN	This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
REED	Victor's better at these things.

REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
BEN	Should?

BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
REED	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.

BEN	How long was I out?
REED	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
BEN	Solid.

REED	I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
BEN	Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
REED	I should have done more, run more tests --

BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

REED	What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
BEN	Well maybe you should date him.

REED	Are you alright?
BEN	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

BEN	What the --!
REED	Ben. Are you okay?
BEN	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!

REED	We had a tough year.
BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.

BEN	You got a chisel round here?
REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

REED	Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
REED	O-kay. We'll skip that question.

BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.

REED	Ben --
BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
REED	We're working as hard as we can --
BEN	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.

BEN	Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--

REED	Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
BEN	Got it, teach.

REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
BEN	Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.

BEN	What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.

JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
BEN	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.

JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
BEN	'Course not. Strictly business.
JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.

BEN	Where... where am I?
JOHNNY	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
BEN	Reed?... Sue?
JOHNNY	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.

BEN	What's wrong with me?
JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
BEN	Give me a mirror...

JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!

JOHNNY	Hey! That's a prototype!
BEN	Go back to the drawing board.

BEN	The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
JOHNNY	Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.

BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.

DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
VICTOR	And they're changing into...
DOCTOR	I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
VICTOR	What do you mean "complete"?
DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --

VICTOR	What?
DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --

DOCTOR	But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
VICTOR	That's terrible news...

SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
JOHNNY	I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --

SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
JOHNNY	So are you!
SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.

JOHNNY	Me like-y.
SEXY NURSE	Stay right. Left is trouble.
JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.

SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
JOHNNY	Not this again --
SEXY NURSE	No: You're ON FIRE!

REED	Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
JOHNNY	What about you?

REED	He's not responsive --
JOHNNY	Ben! Ben!

JOHNNY	Now what is up with that?
REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
JOHNNY	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?

JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
REED	Ben, are you there?

JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
REED	You've been working out.

REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...

JOHNNY	Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
REED	Oh, it is.

REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
JOHNNY	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

REED	Back it down, Johnny!
JOHNNY	I can go hotter!

REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
JOHNNY	Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.

REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
JOHNNY	What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
REED	What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?

JOHNNY	He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
REED	They're not costumes.

REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.

REED	You need to control yourself and think before you --
JOHNNY	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?

REED	Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
JOHNNY	But all these people...
REED	Now.

SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!

SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
JOHNNY	Please tell me you go silent too.

JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
SUE	Johnny.

SUE	Stop it.
JOHNNY	Okay, "mom."

JOHNNY	What is that thing?
SUE	I think that thing is Ben.

JOHNNY	Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
SUE	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
JOHNNY	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.

JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
JOHNNY	Sweet.
SUE	That's the temperature of the sun.

JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
SUE	Girl...?!

SUE	I'm driving.
JOHNNY	Dude. That's my sister.

JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
SUE	You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

SUE	You two need a time-out.
JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!

SUE	Johnny? Did you see Ben?
JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
SUE	Is that what you call it? "Real"?
JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

SUE	Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
JOHNNY	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
SUE	As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.

JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
SUE	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

SUE	What are you doing --
JOHNNY	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
SUE	But Johnny... you can't fly.

VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
LEONARD	And if he's not...?
VICTOR	Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
VICTOR	Showtime.

LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
VICTOR	It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
LEONARD	Then what is it?
VICTOR	History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?

VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
LEONARD	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

VICTOR	How's the IPO?
LEONARD	Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
VICTOR	Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
LEONARD	Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
VICTOR	And that's a good thing?

LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
VICTOR	Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...

LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
VICTOR	That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."

VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
LEONARD	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
VICTOR	Front page?
LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.

REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
SUE	Never better.

REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
SUE	I was talking about us. Working together.

REED	Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
SUE	Right. That's exactly what I meant.

REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
SUE	It's been changed.

REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...

REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
SUE	Great minds think alike.

REED	Feeling better?
SUE	Yes, thanks.
REED	That's good. That's uh... good.
SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.

SUE	You're happy for me and Victor.
REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
SUE	Which was?
REED	Passion.

REED	For science.
SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.

REED	Uh, Sue...? I can't.
SUE	What? What do you mean you --
REED	Sue... look at your hands.

SUE	It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.

SUE	What?
REED	We need to get past them.

REED	Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
SUE	What...?  Oh.

SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
REED	That's what we're here to find out.
SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...

REED	It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
SUE	What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?

REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
SUE	Excuse me?

REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
SUE	Anger. Rage. Frustration.
REED	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.

SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
REED	What in the world would give me that idea?

REED	I mean, you broke up with me, right?
SUE	Are you kidding?
REED	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...

SUE	Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?

REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
SUE	No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.

SUE	What are you doing?
REED	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.

REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
SUE	And reverse the mutations --
REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.

SUE	But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
REED	Of course. Of course.
SUE	And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...

SUE	Reed. How close are we to a cure?
REED	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
SUE	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.

REED	Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
SUE	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
REED	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.

REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
SUE	Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.

SUE	Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
REED	You were?
SUE	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
SUE	I gave him twenty.

REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
SUE	I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.

SUE	When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
REED	Why didn't you say something?
SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.

REED	I can... make it work.
SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
REED	The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
SUE	You need a doctor.

REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.

REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
SUE	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.

VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
REED	You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...

VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
REED	Not at all.

REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
VICTOR	The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.

VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
REED	Hilarious.

VICTOR	Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
REED	Sure.

REED	We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
VICTOR	Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
REED	Ben's still out there --
VICTOR	So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.

REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.

REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.

VICTOR	Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
REED	Ben did this.
VICTOR	Ben did this?
REED	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.

VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
REED	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.

VICTOR	Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
REED	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
VICTOR	Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
VICTOR	I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!

REED	What are you doing here?
VICTOR	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
VICTOR	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.

SUE	It's just business.
VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
SUE	I understand the business reasons.
VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.

SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

SUE	What are you doing?
VICTOR	Raising the shields.
SUE	You can't leave them out there.

VICTOR	What's going on?
SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?

SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
VICTOR	Just find him.

SUE	Victor, your scar --
VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
VICTOR	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.

SUE	You said it was urgent.
VICTOR	It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...

SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
VICTOR	Susan. What are you doing?

SUE	He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
VICTOR	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?

SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.

SUE	Please don't make this personal --
VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
SUE	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.

THE THING	'Scuse me.
VICTOR	I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.

THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
THE THING	Skeptical...?

BLONDELL	B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
JORDAN	Thank you, ensign.
BLONDELL	No problem, lieutenant.

BLONDELL	They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN	That's what I hear.
BLONDELL	Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
JORDAN	Who's "we"?
BLONDELL	Just some of the women.

JORDAN	I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
BLONDELL	I've been accused of that wish.
JORDAN	The woman I saw you with...
BLONDELL	Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
JORDAN	But are there... I mean, how many...
BLONDELL	More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.

BLONDELL	Administration, Ensign Blondell.
JORDAN	Don't say my name.
BLONDELL	Who's...  Lieuten --
JORDAN	Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
BLONDELL	Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
JORDAN	Wickwire, Thomas Dane.  See what you can find.

BLONDELL	Got it.
JORDAN	Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
BLONDELL	Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...

BLONDELL	Wow...
JORDAN	What'd you find, Kathy?

DEHAVEN	Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
C.O.	Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
DEHAVEN	-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
C.O.	-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
DEHAVEN	Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.

DEHAVEN	Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
C.O.	Your prerogative, Senator.
DEHAVEN	Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
C.O.	Standing right here in my office.
DEHAVEN	Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?

C.O.	Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
DEHAVEN	Security?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
C.O.	Of course, but there's more --
DEHAVEN	Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...

C.O.	Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
JORDAN	Thank you, sir.
C.O.	Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
JORDAN	I'm fine, sir.
C.O.	So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
JORDAN	Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.

JORDAN	Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
C.O.	Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
JORDAN	Really, I have no problem with --
C.O.	I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
JORDAN	None at this time, sir.
C.O.	Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.

JORDAN	Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
C.O.	If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.

JORDAN	Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
C.O.	Didn't take long.

C.O.	All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
JORDAN	It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
C.O.	Oh, really.
JORDAN	It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
C.O.	Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
JORDAN	I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
C.O.	Did you just have a brain-fart?
JORDAN	Pardon?
C.O.	Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
JORDAN	I think you've resented me from the start, sir.

C.O.	What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
JORDAN	No, sir.
C.O.	No, sir, WHAT?
JORDAN	The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.

C.O.	Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
JORDAN	Same rules for everyone, sir.
C.O.	Straight up?
JORDAN	Across the board, sir.
C.O.	And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
JORDAN	Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

C.O.	Then good night.
JORDAN	So I'll get a fair shot?
C.O.	You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.

JORDAN	See me, sir?
C.O.	You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?

JORDAN	Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
C.O.	We'll all have lunch.  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!

JORDAN	Permission to leave, sir?
C.O.	Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.

C.O.	I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
JORDAN	Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

JORDAN	I'm saying, we're just friends.
C.O.	I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
JORDAN	Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
C.O.	I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

JORDAN	Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
C.O.	I'm not sure what --
JORDAN	Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?

C.O.	Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
JORDAN	Sir?  What did he say?
C.O.	Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.

CORTEZ	Aw, what is this...
JORDAN	Sir...

JORDAN	Ah, c'mon...
CORTEZ	Motherachrist...

JORDAN	Fine by me, sir!
CORTEZ	No problem, sir!

JORDAN	Newberry, get a photo.  South?
CORTEZ	Entering my scan now...
JORDAN	West?

MCCOOL	Shit.  Think we're had.
CORTEZ	Smoke her.
MCCOOL	I ain't gonna shoot her.
CORTEZ	Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
MCCOOL	Hey.  Ain't your call, man.

CORTEZ	Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
MCCOOL	Fuck me.

CORTEZ	What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
MCCOOL	O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE	White House boys want a private meeting.
DEHAVEN	I'll act surprised.

DEHAVEN	Think I overplayed it?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE	Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.

DEHAVEN	Yes?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE	Did you hear?
DEHAVEN	She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
DEHAVEN'S AIDE	Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.

HAYES	... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
DEHAVEN	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...

HAYES	Hardly the case, Senator.
DEHAVEN	Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...

DEHAVEN	The Lark Report.
HAYES	Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
DEHAVEN	The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
HAYES	I was one member of the investigating commission.
DEHAVEN	Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
HAYES	I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
DEHAVEN	I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.

HAYES	The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
DEHAVEN	That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.

DEHAVEN	So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
JORDAN	Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
DEHAVEN	High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.

JORDAN	Coronado.
DEHAVEN	California.
JORDAN	I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
DEHAVEN	This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
JORDAN	Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
DEHAVEN	My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
JORDAN	Uh, question, ma'am.
DEHAVEN	Yes, dear.
JORDAN	Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
DEHAVEN	There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...

JORDAN	Can't complain, ma'am.
DEHAVEN	Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
JORDAN	Uh, ma'am.
DEHAVEN	Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.

DEHAVEN	Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
JORDAN	Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

JORDAN	You know him.
DEHAVEN	Sounds familiar.
JORDAN	It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
DEHAVEN	Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
JORDAN	Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
DEHAVEN	Absolutely not.

DEHAVEN	Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
JORDAN	What changed?
DEHAVEN	Should probably ask him that.
JORDAN	If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.

JORDAN	So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
DEHAVEN	What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
JORDAN	You don't know that.
DEHAVEN	In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
JORDAN	What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
DEHAVEN	I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.

JORDAN	You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
DEHAVEN	Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
JORDAN	So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
DEHAVEN	The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
JORDAN	I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.

DEHAVEN	I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
JORDAN	You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
DEHAVEN	I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
JORDAN	I'm sure it is.
DEHAVEN	You'll think about my offer?
JORDAN	You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
DEHAVEN	Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.

HAYES	So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
FLAG OFFICER #1	I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
HAYES	Then I suggest we start there.
FLAG OFFICER #1	Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.

HAYES	What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
FLAG OFFICER #1	I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
HAYES	G.I. Jane.  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?

JORDAN	Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
FLEA	It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
JORDAN	So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
FLEA	No, ma'am.
JORDAN	Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
FLEA	I'll work on it, ma'am.
JORDAN	Do that.

JORDAN	Hey.  You okay, Flea?
FLEA	'Snot me.  It's him.

FLEA	Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
JORDAN	Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

FLEA	Close as I can get, el-tee!
JORDAN	Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

FLEA	Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
JORDAN	Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
JORDAN	I can make this wall without --
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	... two... one... MARK!

JORDAN	Just do it, okay?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
JORDAN	Come on, Montgomery...
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	O'Neil?
JORDAN	Sir?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS	You're wanted at the C.O.'s.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Time.
THE CHIEF	Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
THE CHIEF	Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.

THE CHIEF	Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Get it up!

THE CHIEF	You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
THE CHIEF	I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
THE CHIEF	She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
THE CHIEF	Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	I oughtta report you.
THE CHIEF	I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.

JORDAN	Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
JORDAN	I'll try anyway, sir.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
JORDAN	What "all females"?  If I'm the only --

JORDAN	The Navy Cross...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
JORDAN	I was looking for him earlier, but...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
JORDAN	Just a coincidence?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO	Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.

JORDAN	Lieutenant O'Neil.
ROYCE	Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
JORDAN	Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?

JORDAN	Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
ROYCE	Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
JORDAN	Chances of recovery?
ROYCE	You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.

JORDAN	North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
ROYCE	Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
JORDAN	Unless you Whiskey Run.
ROYCE	Blank faces here, O'Neil.
JORDAN	Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.

ROYCE	You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
JORDAN	Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?

ROYCE	That was good headwork, lieutenant.
JORDAN	Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
ROYCE	Probably hear back from CNN first.
JORDAN	Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
ROYCE	Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.

ROYCE	By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
JORDAN	Is this my glory, sir?

ROYCE	So why're you even considering it? Are you?
JORDAN	Just like you would be.
ROYCE	Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
JORDAN	I take it you don't either.  Feet.

ROYCE	Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
JORDAN	Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
ROYCE	She's haze grey and underway...
JORDAN	You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
ROYCE	So dump on me.
JORDAN	This has nothing to do with you.
ROYCE	Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
JORDAN	Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
ROYCE	You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
JORDAN	Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
ROYCE	I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
JORDAN	Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
ROYCE	I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
JORDAN	Which is guy-speak for...
ROYCE	Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
JORDAN	You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.

ROYCE	Jordan...
JORDAN	Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.

ROYCE	I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
JORDAN	It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
ROYCE	How hard they making it on you?

ROYCE	That bad?
JORDAN	I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?

ROYCE	Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
JORDAN	Me?  Why me?
ROYCE	Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
JORDAN	I saw an article...
ROYCE	I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.

JORDAN	So why are you telling me this?
ROYCE	Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
JORDAN	You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
ROYCE	I'm only trying to warn you in case --
JORDAN	Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
ROYCE	That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
JORDAN	Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
ROYCE	Jordan.  You watch your ass.
JORDAN	Sure.  I'll join the crowd.

JORDAN	All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
ROYCE	And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
JORDAN	Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
ROYCE	Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
JORDAN	No shortage of suspects.
ROYCE	The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?

ROYCE	C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
JORDAN	It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
ROYCE	Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
JORDAN	I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
ROYCE	Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.

ROYCE	John James Urgayle.  The Chief.
JORDAN	What about him.
JORDAN	Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
JORDAN	Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
ROYCE	Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
JORDAN	I don't know, I don't care.
ROYCE	Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.

JORDAN	In Washington...
ROYCE	What?
JORDAN	Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...

ROYCE	Wickwire, Thomas Dane... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
JORDAN	You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
ROYCE	I'd sure like to know who.
JORDAN	Yeah.  Me too.

JORDAN	So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
ROYCE	Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
JORDAN	Which is guy-speak for...
ROYCE	Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long.

WICKWIRE	They're more afraid of you.
JORDAN	Well, now I feel so much better.
WICKWIRE	It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
JORDAN	Whose orders were those?
WICKWIRE	It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN	And how do you know that?
WICKWIRE	Made it to Week 10 last time.
JORDAN	I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
WICKWIRE	You're kind of a surprise yourself.

WICKWIRE	Hey.  Way to gut it out.
JORDAN	Thanks, Wick.

JORDAN	Who is it?
WICKWIRE	You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
JORDAN	Wick.  They got your crew, too?
WICKWIRE	Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.

JORDAN	You really came back for more?  Of this?
WICKWIRE	When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
JORDAN	If you got a good one, Wick...

WICKWIRE	One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
JORDAN	They had to kill 'em?
WICKWIRE	Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
JORDAN	That's a good story.
WICKWIRE	So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
JORDAN	He was married?
WICKWIRE	At first.
JORDAN	You got anybody, Wick?
WICKWIRE	Not me.  You?

WICKWIRE	O'Neil?
JORDAN	How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
WICKWIRE	Last time I didn't.
JORDAN	Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...

JORDAN	Sorry, didn't mean to --
WICKWIRE	That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
JORDAN	First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
WICKWIRE	Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
JORDAN	I can't go out.  Not like this.
WICKWIRE	I think you look beautiful.
JORDAN	Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...

JORDAN	Do you, uh, know...
WICKWIRE	Sure, sure.
JORDAN	We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
WICKWIRE	Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.

WICKWIRE	I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
JORDAN	This is insane.  You've got no proof.

JORDAN	What're you guys doing?  Huh?
MCCOOL	Just askin'
JORDAN	What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --

MCCOOL	She part of the training?
JORDAN	I don't know...

JORDAN	If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
MCCOOL	Mighta been civilian.

MCCOOL	32 feet, six inches!
JORDAN	I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!

JORDAN	'Cool?
MCCOOL	Smoke it!

JORDAN	So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
MCCOOL	Maybe half.  Not even.
JORDAN	Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.

JORDAN	Say again, sir?
THE CHIEF	You heard me.  Move on.

JORDAN	Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
THE CHIEF	Educate her, Pyro.

JORDAN	Permission to get dressed, sir?
THE CHIEF	It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
JORDAN	Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
THE CHIEF	For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
JORDAN	I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
THE CHIEF	Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?

THE CHIEF	Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
JORDAN	It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.

THE CHIEF	England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
JORDAN	McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
THE CHIEF	You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.

THE CHIEF	Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
JORDAN	Dad.
THE CHIEF	Any brothers?  Sisters?
JORDAN	Dick, Jane, and Spot.
THE CHIEF	Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
JORDAN	Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
THE CHIEF	You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
JORDAN	Should I be afraid?
THE CHIEF	Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?

THE CHIEF	Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
JORDAN	Wasn't deemed a threat.
THE CHIEF	She led us right to you.  That's no threat?

THE CHIEF	Would you have shot if it was a man?
JORDAN	No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
THE CHIEF	The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
JORDAN	That's not right.
THE CHIEF	That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
JORDAN	I think you're the liar.
THE CHIEF	I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
JORDAN	We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
THE CHIEF	You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?

THE CHIEF	Do you?
JORDAN	No.
THE CHIEF	I'm so glad we agree.

THE CHIEF	Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
JORDAN	Sure.  Just like your men do.
THE CHIEF	I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.

THE CHIEF	Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
JORDAN	Good to see you again, too, sir.
THE CHIEF	Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.

THE CHIEF	Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
JORDAN	Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
THE CHIEF	Say again?  How many micks?
JORDAN	15, sir.

THE CHIEF	Got it.
JORDAN	Show us where you are, Chief.

THE CHIEF	O'Neil...
JORDAN	Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

SLUTNIK	Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
JORDAN	Your new roommate.

JORDAN	Anybody usin' these drawers here?
SLUTNIK	Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
JORDAN	Funny, the C.O. says I can.

SLUTNIK	Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
JORDAN	That your desk?  I'll take this one.
SLUTNIK	WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
JORDAN	Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.

SLUTNIK	Clear.
JORDAN	North?

JORDAN	All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
SLUTNIK	Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
JORDAN	MOVE!

SLUTNIK	I just wonder how that happened.
JORDAN	Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.

SLUTNIK	You don't suppose this is just part of...
JORDAN	FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?

SLUTNIK	Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
JORDAN	Shut your hole, Slutnik.

MCCOOL	We're fucked.
SLUTNIK	Darth Vader reads poetry...
MCCOOL	We are so fucked.

SLUTNIK	Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
MCCOOL	Somebody throw a tent over this circus.

MCCOOL	You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
SLUTNIK	So am I.

SLUTNIK	This ain't workin' right!
MCCOOL	What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
SLUTNIK	This ain't even workin' wrong!

THE SPOOK	Subject?
ROYCE	O'Neil, Jordan.
THE SPOOK	Thought you two were file-closed.
ROYCE	You knew about us?
THE SPOOK	Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.

THE SPOOK	All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
ROYCE	The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
THE SPOOK	Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
ROYCE	The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
THE SPOOK	Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
ROYCE	Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
THE SPOOK	Hmm.  Let's aim higher.

THE SPOOK	The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
ROYCE	The first female President?
THE SPOOK	Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
ROYCE	Women.
THE SPOOK	If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
ROYCE	I don't know.  Seems...
THE SPOOK	This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
ROYCE	Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
THE SPOOK	I take it this file is still open.
ROYCE	Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
THE SPOOK	Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
ROYCE	I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
THE SPOOK	This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.

ANIMAL	That's cuz I'm married to you.
LUCY	Shut up. How can you eat like that?
ANIMAL	Big bites.

LUCY	I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
ANIMAL	Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
LUCY	Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.

LUCY	Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
ANIMAL	Great. See ya then.

ANIMAL	Who the hell are all these people?
LUCY	What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
ANIMAL	Where's Audrey?
LUCY	In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
ANIMAL	What?
LUCY	All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
ANIMAL	Me!? You where the one...
LUCY	Go in there. Talk to her.

ANIMAL	I like that image.
AUDREY	You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.

AUDREY	Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
ANIMAL	Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
AUDREY	Well, I can be tough if I want.

ANIMAL	That why you dumped him?
AUDREY	No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...

ANIMAL	How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
AUDREY	Nearly four years...

AUDREY	Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
ANIMAL	Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

AUDREY	He stole my report! That's my report!
ANIMAL	We know, Audrey.

ANIMAL	You okay?
AUDREY	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
ANIMAL	You made a mistake.

AUDREY	Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
ANIMAL	Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
AUDREY	Yeah. Why are you asking?
ANIMAL	I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.

AUDREY	My God. He's going after the nest.
ANIMAL	Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.

AUDREY	Animal, I can't.
ANIMAL	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.

AUDREY	What are you doing?
ANIMAL	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

AUDREY	What are you doing?
ANIMAL	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.

AUDREY	Don't you think we have enough?
ANIMAL	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

AUDREY	Think we can fit up in there?
ANIMAL	Only one way to find out.

AUDREY	He's not going to do it.
ANIMAL	Oh yes he will.

AUDREY	Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
ANIMAL	You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
AUDREY	The JFK? In the rain!?

ANIMAL	What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
AUDREY	But we can get to the west side faster.

ANIMAL	Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
AUDREY	No.

NICK	I'll take them all.
AUDREY	You must have quite some harem.

NICK	Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
AUDREY	It's good to see you, Nick.

NICK	So you made it.
AUDREY	What?

NICK	You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
AUDREY	Yeah, well...

AUDREY	So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
NICK	No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
AUDREY	You're still mad at me, aren't you?
NICK	You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
AUDREY	That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
NICK	Most people don't.
AUDREY	I'm sorry you feel that way.

NICK	Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
AUDREY	Sure. I'd like that.

AUDREY	I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
NICK	When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
AUDREY	And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
NICK	I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
AUDREY	And you think this creature is one of them?
NICK	Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
AUDREY	Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
NICK	I got pretty close.
AUDREY	What else do you know about it?

NICK	...he's pregnant.
AUDREY	Are you sure?

NICK	Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
AUDREY	I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?

NICK	The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
AUDREY	Nesting?
NICK	Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!

AUDREY	Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
NICK	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
AUDREY	You never said it was off the record.
NICK	I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
AUDREY	I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
NICK	So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?

NICK	What are you doing here?
AUDREY	I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
NICK	I was wrong.

NICK	Circuits are overloaded.
AUDREY	I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.

AUDREY	Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
NICK	How do you know?
AUDREY	Our network covers the Ranger games.

AUDREY	The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
NICK	Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.

NICK	If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
AUDREY	Oh my God! They're coming!

NICK	Are you okay?
AUDREY	Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
NICK	You'd be surprised.
AUDREY	Really? I'd like to find out.

AUDREY	Who was that French guy, anyway.
NICK	Oh, just some insurance guy.

AUDREY	And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
LUCY	Speak of the devil.

AUDREY	My life sucks.
LUCY	Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.

AUDREY	I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
LUCY	He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

AUDREY	It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
LUCY	Who is he?
AUDREY	He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.

LUCY	Did Romeo have a name?
AUDREY	Nick Tatopoulos.

LUCY	Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
AUDREY	That's the problem. He did.

LUCY	What the hell are you doing?
AUDREY	Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
LUCY	Your old sweetheart?
AUDREY	Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
LUCY	I left my forgery kit back at the office.

AUDREY	Wish me luck!
LUCY	Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
AUDREY	I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.

AUDREY	Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
KID	What's it to you?
AUDREY	Can I use some?
KID	What do I get?
AUDREY	The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
KID	Five bucks.
AUDREY	You're kidding, right?

AUDREY	Did you talk with Humphries?
CAIMAN	This is not the place...
AUDREY	Just tell me, did you talk with him?
CAIMAN	He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
AUDREY	Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?

AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, you're married.
CAIMAN	And you're beautiful...
AUDREY	Mr. Caiman...
CAIMAN	Call me Charlie.
AUDREY	Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
CAIMAN	So have dinner with me tonight.
AUDREY	I can't.
CAIMAN	It's your choice.

AUDREY	Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
CAIMAN	What?
AUDREY	I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
CAIMAN	Not now. You got my bag?

AUDREY	You don't understand, I can get us information...
CAIMAN	Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

CAIMAN	We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
AUDREY	We? I don't think so.
CAIMAN	I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
AUDREY	Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

NICK	Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
ELSIE	Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

ELSIE	Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
NICK	Oh, I'm not married.
ELSIE	Really? A girlfriend then?
NICK	No. Perhaps I work too much.
ELSIE	You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?

NICK	Not for a long time, now.
ELSIE	Well, I think you're cute.
NICK	Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?

ELSIE	Hence the radiation.
NICK	More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.

ELSIE	Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
NICK	I don't think so.

ELSIE	I'm sorry about all this.
NICK	Me too.

NICK	Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
ELSIE	I'll try.

JEAN-CLAUDE	Merde!
RAYMOND	Allez, allez!

JEAN-CLAUDE	They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
RAYMOND	That is when we will go in.

JEAN-CLAUDE	We've secured the doors on both levels.
RAYMOND	Where's Luc and Pierre?
JEAN-CLAUDE	They didn't make it.
RAYMOND	Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!

LT. ANDERSON	When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
MAJOR HICKS	Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
LT. ANDERSON	Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
MAJOR HICKS	Have them sealed off.
LT. ANDERSON	And how should we do that, Sir?
MAJOR HICKS	Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!

MAJOR HICKS	Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
RAYMOND	They are with me!

RAYMOND	CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
MAJOR HICKS	You're fast.
RAYMOND	That is our job.
MAJOR HICKS	Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
RAYMOND	Major, what do you think could have done this?
MAJOR HICKS	Get your people out of there or I will.

MAJOR HICKS	Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
NICK	It's Tatopoulos.
MAJOR HICKS	Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
NICK	Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
MAJOR HICKS	Follow me.

NICK	You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
MAJOR HICKS	We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.

NICK	Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
MAJOR HICKS	We know.

NICK	Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
MAJOR HICKS	Yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK	The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
MAJOR HICKS	No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
NICK	It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?

MAJOR HICKS	Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
NICK	They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
MAJOR HICKS	Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.

NICK	What sample?
MAJOR HICKS	You're standing on it.

NICK	That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
MAJOR HICKS	That's right.
NICK	But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
MAJOR HICKS	We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.

NICK	Somebody must have seen it.
MAJOR HICKS	It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.

NICK	The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
MAJOR HICKS	Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
NICK	What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.

NICK	You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
MAJOR HICKS	What are you suggesting?
NICK	When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.

NICK	Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS	You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
NICK	Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.

NICK	No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
MAJOR HICKS	So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
NICK	It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.

MAJOR HICKS	You gave them the tape?
NICK	No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.

MAJOR HICKS	We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
MAYOR	But you don't know for sure!

MAJOR HICKS	General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
MAYOR	Last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS	That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.

MAYOR	Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
MAJOR HICKS	We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
MAYOR	That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?

MAJOR HICKS	Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
MAYOR	You don't have the authority to do that.

RAYMOND	Are you looking for this?
NICK	Thanks.

NICK	Do I know you?
RAYMOND	We've met before.
NICK	Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

RAYMOND	SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
NICK	Sounds like a big company.
RAYMOND	It's the French Secret Service.
NICK	Oh.
RAYMOND	We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
NICK	Are you sure? How do you know?
RAYMOND	We know.
NICK	Why are you telling this to me?
RAYMOND	I need you to trust me.
NICK	Why do you need that?
RAYMOND	I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
NICK	Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
RAYMOND	We, have already taken care of them.

NICK	How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
RAYMOND	This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.

NICK	So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
RAYMOND	I am not permitted to speak of such things.

RAYMOND	I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
NICK	Sure.
RAYMOND	It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
NICK	Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
RAYMOND	Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.

NICK	Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
RAYMOND	So you're in?
NICK	Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.

NICK	What's with the chewing gum?
RAYMOND	Makes us look more American.

NICK	They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
RAYMOND	Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.

NICK	Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
RAYMOND	You were right.

RAYMOND	I think we should leave now.
NICK	Good idea.

RAYMOND	Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
NICK	How do I do that?
RAYMOND	555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.

RAYMOND	What'd they say?
NICK	I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

RAYMOND	Who the hell are you?
NICK	It's okay. I know her.

NICK	Hello?
RAYMOND	It's Raymond.
NICK	Where are you?

NICK	I understand.
RAYMOND	I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
NICK	Wait.  Au revoir.

LYSSA	I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
COLWYN	I don't have to go through with it either.
LYSSA	You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
COLWYN	Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
LYSSA	Me too.
COLWYN	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
LYSSA	Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
COLWYN	That's worse.
LYSSA	You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
COLWYN	Well, you're beautiful.
LYSSA	You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
COLWYN	If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
LYSSA	I have no intention of getting used to it.

LYSSA	Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
COLWYN	<u>What</u>?
LYSSA	We're almost married.
COLWYN	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
LYSSA	Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.

LYSSA	I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
COLWYN	Never mind my ears! Go away!

LYSSA	There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
COLWYN	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
LYSSA	I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
COLWYN	Thank you, but I can wait.
LYSSA	I can't.

COLWYN	I lied.
LYSSA	About what?
COLWYN	I can't wait either.

COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
LYSSA	Colwyn.

COLWYN	Have they harmed you?
LYSSA	No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.

COLWYN	Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
LYSSA	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.

COLWYN	Lyssa ...
LYSSA	Colwyn ...
COLWYN	Where is the Fortress?
LYSSA	I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
COLWYN	I will find you. I will be with you.
LYSSA	I know it.
COLWYN	I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
LYSSA	Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.

LYSSA	Colwyn ...
COLWYN	You must move away from the Center.
LYSSA	All the passages are guarded.

COLWYN	Will your power outward.
LYSSA	I don't know how.
COLWYN	You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.

COLWYN	Take the western passage.
LYSSA	All directions are the same here.

LYSSA	Yes.
COLWYN	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
LYSSA	I knew you would come.

COLWYN	Lyssa ...
LYSSA	Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.

COLWYN	In the Arctic ice.
LYSSA	That way. I can feel the cold.

LYSSA	That's a better one.
COLWYN	Yes.

TUROLD	You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
COLWYN	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
TUROLD	Of course it was.

COLWYN	They have Lyssa!
TUROLD	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!

TUROLD	You will go alone.
COLWYN	I won't leave you here.
TUROLD	You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
COLWYN	I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
TUROLD	You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.

COLWYN	The White Castle has fallen.
YNYR	Does the Queen live?
COLWYN	The new Queen lives.
YNYR	Turold's son was to marry her.
COLWYN	We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
YNYR	I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.

YNYR	This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
COLWYN	I have no extraordinary powers.
YNYR	Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
COLWYN	In the old books. It's called a glaive.

YNYR	With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
COLWYN	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
YNYR	There is no other way.
COLWYN	But there is another entrance to this place.

YNYR	But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
COLWYN	You have rope?
YNYR	I am too old to climb down a rope.
COLWYN	You won't have to.

COLWYN	There is nothing.
YNYR	Reach out farther. Call to her.
COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...

YNYR	You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
COLWYN	She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
YNYR	It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
COLWYN	The Fortress moves?
YNYR	Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
COLWYN	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
YNYR	No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
COLWYN	Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
YNYR	You have not slept in two days.
COLWYN	Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.

YNYR	You choose these?
COLWYN	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.

COLWYN	They know when they're going to die?
YNYR	Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.

COLWYN	I can't reach her.
YNYR	What do you see?
COLWYN	Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.

COLWYN	She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
YNYR	Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
COLWYN	She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
YNYR	The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
COLWYN	I will find her!

COLWYN	I cannot reach her.
YNYR	She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.

COLWYN	The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
YNYR	No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
COLWYN	<u>Why</u>?
YNYR	I'm not sure.
COLWYN	But you suspect.
YNYR	You will know, in good time.

COLWYN	No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
YNYR	There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
COLWYN	Yes.
YNYR	He has come for Lyssa.
COLWYN	Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
YNYR	Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
COLWYN	Can she be forced?
YNYR	No. She must agree of her own free will.
COLWYN	Never.
YNYR	You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
COLWYN	Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
YNYR	Yes.

COLWYN	Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
YNYR	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!

COLWYN	I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
YNYR	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.

YNYR	From here, I must go alone.
COLWYN	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
YNYR	You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.

YNYR	He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
COLWYN	Let us wish him peace.

YNYR	They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
COLWYN	The Beast will kill her.
YNYR	Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.

YNYR	She must make a glaive.
COLWYN	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.

YNYR	The spiral begins in the west.
COLWYN	Where the spiral begins.

COLWYN	She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
YNYR	I chose the wrong passage.
COLWYN	She can see the Beast!
YNYR	Use your sword.
COLWYN	What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
YNYR	Cut. <u>Cut</u>!

YNYR	You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
COLWYN	You're coming with us.
YNYR	It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
COLWYN	No! You cannot know that!
YNYR	I can. Because I choose it.
COLWYN	I forbid you!

COLWYN	How did you know?
CYCLOPS	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.

COLWYN	Slayers!
CYCLOPS	We must enter the swamp.

CYCLOPS	Do not let the waters touch you.
COLWYN	What will happen?

CYCLOPS	They can be saddled.
COLWYN	You have done it?
CYCLOPS	I road them often in my youth.
COLWYN	Saddles.

COLWYN	It is today?
CYCLOPS	Yes. It is today.

COLWYN	Each to his fate.
CYCLOPS	Each to his fate.

COLWYN	I know the cruelty of such a fate.
VELLA	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
COLWYN	I don't think that.

VELLA	Am I not worth returning to?
COLWYN	Yes.
VELLA	Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
COLWYN	Yes.
VELLA	Even by you?
COLWYN	Yes.

VELLA	You too are lonely.
COLWYN	I ache with it.
VELLA	Let me comfort you.
COLWYN	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
VELLA	Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
COLWYN	I cannot betray my bride.
VELLA	One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.

COLWYN	I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
VELLA	You will not, then?
COLWYN	I cannot.

ERGO	Help! Help! I'm drowning!
COLWYN	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
ERGO	It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
COLWYN	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
ERGO	Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
COLWYN	Perhaps he expected to eat it.
ERGO	For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.

ERGO	I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
COLWYN	What business?
ERGO	Staying alive.

ERGO	Once is enough, thank you.
COLWYN	He saved our lives.

ERGO	Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
COLWYN	I was hoping I might be your friend.
ERGO	My <u>friend</u>.
COLWYN	I have need of friends.
ERGO	No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.

COLWYN	Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
ERGO	<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.

ERGO	Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
COLWYN	You and I will guard the fire.
ERGO	What else is left for a man without friends.

COLWYN	I don't think you'll grow careless.
TORQUIL	Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
COLWYN	Fame.
TORQUIL	Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
COLWYN	Fame is what you leave to your sons.
TORQUIL	How did you know I had sons?
COLWYN	Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
TORQUIL	Hah! You don't know me, boy.
COLWYN	I know you.

TORQUIL	They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
COLWYN	You will follow me.
TORQUIL	And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
COLWYN	So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.

TORQUIL	And where do you lead, boy?
COLWYN	To the place where Death lives.
TORQUIL	It should be an interesting journey, then.
COLWYN	That I promise you.
TORQUIL	I compel no man to follow me on this journey.

TORQUIL	When did you last sleep, boy?
COLWYN	I'm all right.

TORQUIL	They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
COLWYN	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.

COLWYN	I'm not hungry.
TORQUIL	Not sleepy, either?
COLWYN	No.

COLWYN	Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
TORQUIL	Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.

TORQUIL	Well, I'm not impressed.
COLWYN	I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.

TORQUIL	You've eaten nothing.
COLWYN	We must try to get horses.
TORQUIL	Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
COLWYN	These we'll pay for.
TORQUIL	Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
COLWYN	Hand over your dinner.
TORQUIL	A flicker of talent.

COLWYN	Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
TORQUIL	They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.

COLWYN	Go, join them.
TORQUIL	What kind of friend do you think I am?
COLWYN	The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
TORQUIL	Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
COLWYN	Go. I command you.
TORQUIL	Yes, my lord.

COLWYN	We could reach it on fire-mares.
TORQUIL	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.

TORQUIL	We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
COLWYN	At the gallop!

TORQUIL	You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
COLWYN	Subject to the King, no doubt.
TORQUIL	Naturally.

TORQUIL	A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
COLWYN	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
TORQUIL	Perhaps. If the pay is good.

COLWYN	Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
TORQUIL	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
COLWYN	There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.

ERGO	Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
CYCLOPS	Would you settle for a boar?
ERGO	A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.

ERGO	You!
CYCLOPS	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
ERGO	Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
CYCLOPS	I am Quell.

ERGO	What is that awful looking place?
CYCLOPS	The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
ERGO	I'm glad.  I'm very glad.

ERGO	Where are you going?
CYCLOPS	We'll meet you at the inn.
ERGO	Can't I come, too?
CYCLOPS	No.

ERGO	A venison pie as big as a house.
CYCLOPS	A small house.
ERGO	And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.

ERGO	Quell?
CYCLOPS	I cannot go with you, my friend.

ERGO	My heart stays here.
CYCLOPS	And mine goes with you.

ERGO	Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
TITCH	No.
ERGO	Sugarballs?
TITCH	No.
ERGO	What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
TITCH	I have a cinnamon bar.
ERGO	You do?
TITCH	You can have half.

ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
TITCH	I ...  ... am Titch.

TITCH	I'm hungry.
ERGO	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!

ERGO	If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
TITCH	I'd wish for a puppy.
ERGO	One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
TITCH	I only want one.
ERGO	A foolish wish. And you, Quell?

TITCH	Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
ERGO	First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.

ERGO	What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
TITCH	I don't think it's working.
ERGO	Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
TITCH	It's right behind you.

TITCH	We meant only to please you.
ERGO	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?

ERGO	Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
TITCH	Would you desert your friends?
ERGO	No, no. I'm with you, boy.

TORQUIL	But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
ERGO	Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!

ERGO	Put me down, you lout!
TORQUIL	You had better manners as a pig.
ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.

ERGO	What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
TORQUIL	Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
ERGO	And do you think I live on air?
TORQUIL	We have plenty of hares.
ERGO	Food for crows.
TORQUIL	Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
ERGO	I am being exploited! Where are you going?
TORQUIL	I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.

ERGO	Oh, my poor stew!
TORQUIL	Oh, my poor stomach.

TORQUIL	Passable, pimple, very passable.
ERGO	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
TORQUIL	Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.

TORQUIL	I can't hold the weight of both of you!
ERGO	Hush!

ERGO	Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
TORQUIL	Look at its insides.
ERGO	No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.

ERGO	My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
YNYR	The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
ERGO	<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!

ERGO	One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
YNYR	The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
ERGO	He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
YNYR	If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.

YNYR	He didn't join them. They joined him.
ERGO	And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
YNYR	He is the King.
ERGO	Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.

ERGO	They'll trample him to death!
YNYR	No. He will master the leader.

LYSSA	I do not want your power. It is hideous.
VOICE OF THE BEAST	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.

LYSSA	I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then look!

LYSSA	It's a lie!
VOICE OF THE BEAST	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
LYSSA	He will not!
VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then he will die!

LYSSA	He will come for me.
VOICE OF THE BEAST	He will not come. You will be my queen.

QUEEN	What news from our friends?
TUROLD	Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
QUEEN	Freylag's stronghold?
TUROLD	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
QUEEN	It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
TUROLD	The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
QUEEN	It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
TUROLD	We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.

QUEEN	Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
TUROLD	Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.

QUEEN	For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
TUROLD	It is important to assure the succession.
QUEEN	Yes.

QUEEN	I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
TUROLD	I knew.
QUEEN	You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
TUROLD	That I am, my lady.

TUROLD	A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
QUEEN	A match for your son, I think.
TUROLD	A fine match.
QUEEN	They will have the life that you and I might have had.

ROWAN	You were attacked in the forest?
TUROLD	Yes. We lost five.
ROWAN	You were lucky. I lost thirty there.

ROWAN	I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
TUROLD	How many did you lose?
ROWAN	Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
TUROLD	We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.

ROWAN	Modred! Impossible!
TUROLD	He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.

YNYR	We seek the Fortress of Krull.
SEER	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
YNYR	The new King.
SEER	With an old voice?
YNYR	You know the voice.
SEER	Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
YNYR	It is the time.
SEER	I will seek the Fortress for you.

SEER	Can you see?
YNYR	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

YNYR	The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
SEER	They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.

TORQUIL	Knowledge I wouldn't want.
YNYR	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.

YNYR	We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
TORQUIL	There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.

TORQUIL	We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
YNYR	Many have perished in that maze.
TORQUIL	No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.

TORQUIL	The leader of the Dark Ones?
YNYR	Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.

YNYR	I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
TORQUIL	The Widow of the Web?
YNYR	Yes.
TORQUIL	That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
YNYR	She has the power of vision.
TORQUIL	She has the power to kill.
YNYR	Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
TORQUIL	Her name is Death.
YNYR	She had another name once.

YNYR	Few have survived it.
TORQUIL	Fewer will survive them.

TORQUIL	Each to his fate, lad.
YNYR	Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.

YNYR	We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
TORQUIL	It's a hundred leagues from here.

TORQUIL	I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
YNYR	It is not necessary. They will not follow.

TORQUIL	Look.
YNYR	Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.

TORQUIL	Kegan!
YNYR	It is too late. He has drunk.

YNYR	Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
TORQUIL	That is true.

WIDOW	Who speaks that name!
YNYR	Ynyr!

WIDOW	It is fifty years since I heard that name.
YNYR	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
WIDOW	I was beautiful then.
YNYR	The most beautiful woman in the world.
WIDOW	But you would not stay with me.
YNYR	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
WIDOW	She was not as beautiful.
YNYR	No, she was not as beautiful.
WIDOW	She bore you many children?
YNYR	We had no children.
WIDOW	You had a son.
YNYR	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
WIDOW	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
YNYR	Where is he? My son.
WIDOW	I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.

WIDOW	Do not try your trickery on me!
YNYR	It is no trickery.
WIDOW	Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!

YNYR	You see?
WIDOW	Yes.

YNYR	Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
WIDOW	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
YNYR	Knowledge.
WIDOW	Of what?
YNYR	The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
WIDOW	Why must you know?
YNYR	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
WIDOW	You lie!
YNYR	Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
WIDOW	No.
YNYR	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
WIDOW	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.

WIDOW	It will not help.
YNYR	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.

YNYR	I cannot stop the sand.
WIDOW	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
YNYR	You will come with me.
WIDOW	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.

ROPER	Hello, guys.
BAFFERT	Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.

ROPER	They're not usually graduate students.
BAFFERT	SWAT wants to go in.
ROPER	What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?

BAFFERT	No -- you can't do that.
ROPER	You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
BAFFERT	I don't know.
ROPER	He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
BAFFERT	Not that we know of.
ROPER	We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
BAFFERT	Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.

BAFFERT	Floor seats.
ROPER	You're my hero.
BAFFERT	Dinner's on you.
ROPER	Deal.

BAFFERT	Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
ROPER	Phoney Frank? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
BAFFERT	I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
ROPER	Yeah, okay.

BAFFERT	This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
ROPER	You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
BAFFERT	Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
ROPER	It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
BAFFERT	No shit! He's good!
ROPER	Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
BAFFERT	Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.

BAFFERT	Where's the stereo?
ROPER	Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
BAFFERT	Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

BAFFERT	Apartment 306.
ROPER	You want me to go up with you?
BAFFERT	Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
ROPER	Good. I don't want to be late.

BAFFERT	What's the line?
ROPER	It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
BAFFERT	I'll take half of your action.

KORDA	Who is it?
BAFFERT	It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.

KORDA	What happened? Is there a problem?
BAFFERT	May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.

KORDA	Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
BAFFERT	Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

BAFFERT	Where did you find an old recording like that?
KORDA	Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
BAFFERT	I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
KORDA	You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?

BAFFERT	Could I please have a little water?
KORDA	Of course.

KORDA	Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
BAFFERT	This cousin of yours... What's his name?
KORDA	Clarence Teal.

KORDA	You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
CLARENCE	So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.

KORDA	You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
CLARENCE	I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
KORDA	Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
CLARENCE	What happened, Mike.
KORDA	You don't want to know.

KORDA	God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
CLARENCE	I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
KORDA	Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.

KORDA	You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
CLARENCE	Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
KORDA	Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...

CLARENCE	Don't make do it, Mike.
KORDA	Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
CLARENCE	I won't get away with it.
KORDA	Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.

MCCALL	I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
DAVE	You can't help me, man.

MCCALL	Who's controlling your mind?
DAVE	Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?

MCCALL	This has nothing to do with Walter.
DAVE	They want Walter dead!

MCCALL	Tell me what's wrong.
DAVE	Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
MCCALL	How can I help you with the particles?
DAVE	It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.

MCCALL	They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
DAVE	Huh?

DAVE	Tell my dad.
MCCALL	Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
DAVE	Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
MCCALL	I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.

DAVE	I hate fucking Springfield.
MCCALL	Is that where you're family lives?

EARL	Where's the car?
ROPER	I need to get something straight first.

ROPER	It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
EARL	Then where's my FUCKING car!

EARL	Really?
ROPER	Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.

ROPER	The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
EARL	Am I gettin' the car?
ROPER	You're gettin' the car.

EARL	What?!
ROPER	You want a convertible or hardtop?

ROPER	Manual or automatic?
EARL	Automatic.
ROPER	You got it.

JAIL GUARD #2	Who are you again?
KORDA	Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
JAIL GUARD #2	Johnny who?

JAIL GUARD #2	Hold on a second here.
KORDA	Is there a problem?

JAIL GUARD #2	You signed out twice.
KORDA	I what?
JAIL GUARD #2	Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
KORDA	Wait a minute, lemme see that.

KIMURA	Hi, Roper.
ROPER	Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

KIMURA	The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
ROPER	...a car.
KIMURA	That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
ROPER	...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
KIMURA	That's right.
ROPER	What's the suspect's name?
KIMURA	Earl.

ROPER	We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
KIMURA	Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
ROPER	I have to go face to face.

ROPER	Anything on Korda so far?
KIMURA	Solis said to keep you clear of this.

ROPER	What do you got on Korda?
KIMURA	We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
ROPER	Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
KIMURA	Being faxed over now.
ROPER	How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
KIMURA	Roper...
ROPER	And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
KIMURA	Roper, we're into it...

KORDA	You don't have to come here.
ROPER	Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.

KORDA	Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
ROPER	Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.

KORDA	Are you in charge, Roper?
ROPER	Yep.
KORDA	I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.

KORDA	I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
ROPER	Is that all?
KORDA	For now that's all.
ROPER	You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
KORDA	No. You just do shit for me right now.

ROPER	Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
KORDA	I'll give you something.

KORDA	You can't kill me like this.
ROPER	What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?

KORDA	Open your shirt.
ROPER	I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
KORDA	Shut the fuck up and do what I say!

ROPER	Satisfied?
KORDA	Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

ROPER	It's all there.
KORDA	Spread it out.

KORDA	I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
ROPER	Yeah.
KORDA	That's not going to look too good on your service record.
ROPER	I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.

MCCALL	Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
ROPER	You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
MCCALL	I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.

ROPER	Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
MCCALL	Sorry... Habit.

ROPER	We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
MCCALL	If you say so.

ROPER	You ever been in a hostage situation?
MCCALL	Only at the very end.
ROPER	How do you feel after a shooting.
MCCALL	Like it had to be done.

ROPER	It rarely has to be done.
MCCALL	I've rarely shot anyone.
ROPER	SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
MCCALL	I know.
ROPER	Try to remember that.

MCCALL	What's the point of this?
ROPER	A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

MCCALL	I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
ROPER	I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.

ROPER	So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
MCCALL	They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
ROPER	Recruited you from where?
MCCALL	National Marksman Competition.
ROPER	With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
MCCALL	Furthest point I could find from New York.
ROPER	You don't like New York?
MCCALL	Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
ROPER	You'd never been out of New York?
MCCALL	Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
ROPER	How did you like Toronto?
MCCALL	It was okay.
ROPER	You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
MCCALL	You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
ROPER	I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
MCCALL	Is there something wrong with that?
ROPER	I'm not sure.

ROPER	How are we gonna get him out of there?
MCCALL	We could fill it with water.

MCCALL	Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
ROPER	Not the ones I'm at.

ROPER	Come on. Let's go for a drink.
MCCALL	I don't really like to drink.
ROPER	You have to. It's a tradition.
MCCALL	Well, if I have to, I have to.

ROPER	You got a girlfriend?
MCCALL	Why? You like my ass?

ROPER	You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
MCCALL	I don't gamble.

MCCALL	Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
ROPER	You living together?
MCCALL	She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
ROPER	Explain how that works.
MCCALL	She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
ROPER	She grow up in Livingtston, too?
MCCALL	No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
ROPER	Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
MCCALL	We see each other every couple of months.
ROPER	Every couple of months, huh?

ROPER	That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
MCCALL	Do you really?
ROPER	No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
MCCALL	Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
ROPER	Where did you hear that?
MCCALL	Around. Barnett's tough competition.
ROPER	Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.

ROPER	Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
MCCALL	I think I can handle that one.
ROPER	Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

ROPER	You think you can learn, McCall?
MCCALL	I think so.

ROPER	First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
MCCALL	No.
ROPER	It'll come. Try again.

MCCALL	Tell me what you need.
ROPER	I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.

MCCALL	I can't do that.
ROPER	Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.

ROPER	Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
MCCALL	So what do I say to this guy?
ROPER	You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
MCCALL	What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?

ROPER	If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
MCCALL	I'm not good at lying.
ROPER	Get good at it.
MCCALL	It's against my nature.

ROPER	You know the ten commandments?
MCCALL	Yes.
ROPER	What's the first commandment?
MCCALL	Thou shall have no other God before me.

MCCALL	You tell me.
ROPER	Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
MCCALL	Yes.
ROPER	Why?
MCCALL	To save lives.
ROPER	So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?

MCCALL	My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
ROPER	Okay, stop.

ROPER	What did you see?
MCCALL	A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.

MCCALL	Why did he do it?
ROPER	Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...

ROPER	You know why I like the track?
MCCALL	You're a compulsive gambler?

ROPER	See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
MCCALL	I have two words for you... Seek help.
ROPER	I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.

ROPER	I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
MCCALL	I do.

ROPER	We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
MCCALL	Fine.

ROPER	Ronnie... Yeah, so.
MCCALL	Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
ROPER	So what do you want?... An autograph.
MCCALL	I don't know why she'd pick him over you.

MCCALL	I'm just practicing my lying.
ROPER	Still needs work.
MCCALL	You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.

MCCALL	The 6 horse is last.
ROPER	That's okay. That's his style.
MCCALL	To run last?
ROPER	To run late!

MCCALL	The 6 horse is still last.
ROPER	He'll be running at the quarter pole.

MCCALL	They need to run first and second?
ROPER	Yeah, first and second.

MCCALL	COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
ROPER	The jockey!
MCCALL	COME ON, RUSSELL!

MCCALL	We won!
ROPER	We lost.
MCCALL	We won.
ROPER	How much you wanna bet?
MCCALL	You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.

MCCALL	How long you been coming here?
ROPER	About six years. My partner took me.
MCCALL	Is it always like this?
ROPER	Occasionally you lose.

ROPER	See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
MCCALL	Police corruption. It's everywhere.

MCCALL	There's your answer. He's smart.
ROPER	He's cutting down the visibility.
MCCALL	And doing a very good job of it.

MCCALL	He's got the girl.
ROPER	Damnit!

MCCALL	What the fuck is going on.
ROPER	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
MCCALL	You're crazy.
ROPER	Pull up alongside.

ROPER	It might have happened no matter who was up there.
MCCALL	Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
ROPER	Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
MCCALL	I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
ROPER	That it is.

MCCALL	How many have you lost?
ROPER	I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
MCCALL	And what about the ones you don't save?
ROPER	You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
MCCALL	And what if you can't live with it?
ROPER	You've got to decide that for yourself.

ROPER	He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
MCCALL	So what do you want to do?
ROPER	That's a chance I gotta take.
MCCALL	Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.

MCCALL	Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
ROPER	Good question.

ROPER	McCall, you all right?
MCCALL	I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
ROPER	Stay put.

ROPER	Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
OFFICER #1	Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
ROPER	Which apartment?

ROPER	Have you evacuated anyone?
OFFICER #1	Only that floor.
ROPER	Is the hostage injured?
OFFICER #1	Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
ROPER	Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.

ROPER	I know how you feel, Ray.
RAYMOND	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.

ROPER	I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
RAYMOND	You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
ROPER	Let me show you something, Ray.

ROPER	Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
RAYMOND	I ain't interested in your life story.
ROPER	Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
RAYMOND	She's the one to blame. Not me.

ROPER	Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
RAYMOND	What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.

ROPER	Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
RAYMOND	Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
ROPER	I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
RAYMOND	And why the fuck would you do that for me?
ROPER	Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
RAYMOND	Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
ROPER	My name's Scott Roper.

ROPER	This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
RONNIE	Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
ROPER	I worship you.
RONNIE	You worship yourself.
ROPER	Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
RONNIE	Greg.
ROPER	Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.

RONNIE	You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
ROPER	Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.

ROPER	Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
RONNIE	I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
ROPER	This Greg is really getting in my way.

ROPER	Please. I'm begging you.
RONNIE	Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.

RONNIE	Hey.
ROPER	Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
RONNIE	A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
ROPER	I'm not drunk. Yet.
RONNIE	Maybe you should be.
ROPER	You heard.

RONNIE	Yeah. I'm sorry.
ROPER	Can I come in?

ROPER	That a new picture?
RONNIE	About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.

ROPER	I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
RONNIE	You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
ROPER	It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
RONNIE	Scott, You can't save everyone.
ROPER	I've proved that, didn't I?

ROPER	Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
RONNIE	What do you want from me?
ROPER	Something I guess I can't have anymore.
RONNIE	Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
ROPER	You think I didn't need you?
RONNIE	If you did, you never showed it.
ROPER	Ronnie...

ROPER	I wanted to get this out of the way.
RONNIE	You got a bet on the game tonight?
ROPER	As a matter of fact, I do.

RONNIE	It's already started.
ROPER	I was going to catch the last half on TV.

ROPER	That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
RONNIE	No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
ROPER	I've been craving that stuff all week.
RONNIE	And it's hard to get.

ROPER	What do you think?
RONNIE	Mmm, needs a little something.
ROPER	What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
RONNIE	Yeah that's it.
ROPER	Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
RONNIE	Scottie...

RONNIE	Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
ROPER	It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
RONNIE	It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
ROPER	Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.

ROPER	What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
RONNIE	It's okay. We broke up.
ROPER	When?
RONNIE	Just now.

RONNIE	How's Paco doing?
ROPER	He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

ROPER	You like this place?
RONNIE	It's very nice.
ROPER	I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.

RONNIE	There is?
ROPER	For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...

RONNIE	Yeah?
ROPER	...Let me just show you.

ROPER	How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
RONNIE	In Europe women find older men very sexy.

ROPER	Korda escaped.
RONNIE	And you think he'll...

RONNIE	I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
ROPER	Use your imagination.

ROPER	Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
RONNIE	I think I'll stand out here in the sun.

RONNIE	Scottie, Scottie...
ROPER	It's all over, babe, it's all over.

ROPER	Stay here, don't move.
RONNIE	Scottie...
ROPER	Do it!

RONNIE	I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
ROPER	Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.

RONNIE	Scottie?
ROPER	Hmm?
RONNIE	I've been thinking.

ROPER	Hmm?
RONNIE	Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
ROPER	Yeah.
RONNIE	You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.

RONNIE	I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
ROPER	A deeper level?
RONNIE	That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
ROPER	Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
RONNIE	Scott...
ROPER	I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
RONNIE	...the hell are you talking about?
ROPER	I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
RONNIE	I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
ROPER	You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
RONNIE	You thought I was talking about getting married?!

ROPER	You crazy? With all those people around?
RONNIE	Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
ROPER	The hell I am!
RONNIE	Prude.
ROPER	First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.

TRACK ANNOUNCER	...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
ROPER	Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...

TRACK ANNOUNCER	It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
ROPER	I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

ROPER	Stay up there, Girl...
TRACK ANNOUNCER	Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...

ROPER	Where's the damn wire?!
TRACK ANNOUNCER	Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
ROPER	SHIT!

ROPER	Tell him to give me a raise.
SOLIS	He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.

SOLIS	Roper.
ROPER	What?
SOLIS	Are you going to make this hard for me?
ROPER	Depends. What's up?
SOLIS	There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
ROPER	Define concern.

SOLIS	What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
ROPER	Your concern is heartwarming.
SOLIS	It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
ROPER	Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
SOLIS	His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.

ROPER	Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
SOLIS	You let us worry about that.
ROPER	Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
SOLIS	What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
ROPER	The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
SOLIS	What do you think would be in order?
ROPER	Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
SOLIS	Okay, I think I could swing that.

ROPER	And a car.
SOLIS	Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
ROPER	You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
SOLIS	Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
ROPER	The car is part of the deal.
SOLIS	What happened to your Trans Am?

ROPER	Repoed this morning.
SOLIS	I'll provide you with transportation.
ROPER	And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...

SOLIS	The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
ROPER	He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS	I can't do that.
ROPER	I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS	You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
ROPER	Who's running it?
SOLIS	Roper...
ROPER	Who's running it!
SOLIS	Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.

ROPER	What do we got?
SOLIS	32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
ROPER	Any verification on numbers.
SOLIS	We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
ROPER	What have you promised them?
SOLIS	Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

ROPER	Are these yours?
SOLIS	Yeah, they are but...
ROPER	Come on!

CASANOVA	I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
AMAZING	I know you did.
CASANOVA	I knew you'd know.
AMAZING	I know you knew I'd know.
CASANOVA	But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
AMAZING	Of course.

AMAZING	The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
CASANOVA	Really?
AMAZING	I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...

AMAZING	And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
CASANOVA	I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
AMAZING	Um-hmm.
CASANOVA	Except for one little thing.
AMAZING	And what's that?
CASANOVA	That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
AMAZING	What --?

CASANOVA	Everything's going exactly as we planned.
ANABEL	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
CASANOVA	It must have slipped my mind.
ANABEL	Your mind is so slippery.
CASANOVA	Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 

ANABEL	Where are you going?
CASANOVA	Head hunting.

ANABEL	What are you doing all alone in the dark?
CASANOVA	Fantasizing... about you.

CASANOVA	I thought you were done?
ANABEL	One last tweak.

ANABEL	Our guests are waiting.
CASANOVA	I'll be down in a jiffy.

ANABEL	You two timing psychotic bastard.
CASANOVA	Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
ANABEL	Do I?
CASANOVA	I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.

SHOVELER	The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
BOWLER	I'm his daughter.

SHOVELER	Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
BOWLER	Really?

BOWLER	And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
SHOVELER	So who killed him?
BOWLER	The Disco Boys.

SHOVELER	We didn't think this through very well.
BOWLER	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

BOWLER	He was the last time I saw him.
SHOVELER	When was that?
BOWLER	I was eight.

BOWLER	Much less go outside.
SHOVELER	Then Captain Amazing appeared.

BOWLER	We could really use some coffee --
SHOVELER	And some sandwiches --

SHOVELER	Come on, baby!
BOWLER	Do it, big boy!

SHOVELER	Atta, girl!
BOWLER	Atta, boy!

BOWLER	Hey, do I look like a Man?
SHOVELER	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

RAJA	Who are you?
BOWLER	I'm the Bowler.

RAJA	And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
BOWLER	He was cute though.
RAJA	But they all had one thing we haven't got.

BOWLER	How about... the Savage Six?
RAJA	The Inscrutable Six?

BOWLER	But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
RAJA	I can't.

RAJA	I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
BOWLER	But you're a superhero.
RAJA	The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
BOWLER	I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
RAJA	But in fact... you'd found it.

BOWLER	It's late. I'm headin' home.
RAJA	Me, too.
BOWLER	Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

RAJA	No one will believe us.
BOWLER	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

BOWLER	Sounds good to me.
RAJA	Let's do it.

RAJA	But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
BOWLER	Or even what it looks like.

FURIOUS	Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
BOWLER	I thought you'd never ask.

BOWLER	That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
FURIOUS	Half a Dirty Dozen!

FURIOUS	Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
BOWLER	What did he mean?
FURIOUS	I dunno.

BOWLER	Mon Captain, it's for you. 
FURIOUS	Hello?

BOWLER	Hey... you okay?
FURIOUS	Sure.

BOWLER	Eat your mustard.
FURIOUS	It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.

HELLER	Yes!
BOWLER	Doctor Heller?
HELLER	Yes!
BOWLER	It's me... Elizabeth.
HELLER	Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
BOWLER	Thanks.
HELLER	How's your dad?
BOWLER	He's dead.
HELLER	Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.

BOWLER	Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
HELLER	Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --

HELLER	Snap out of it!
BOWLER	Get on to yourself!

HELLER	He'll never make it.
BOWLER	Think positive.

CASANOVA	I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
TONY P	Ummm.
CASANOVA	Have you considered my offer?
TONY P	You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...

TONY P	But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
CASANOVA	I got it.
TONY P	What about Captain Amazing?

CASANOVA	Superheroes.
TONY P	Should I kill them?
CASANOVA	Why bother?

CASANOVA	That boy's got talent.
TONY P	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

FURIOUS	What did you do with Captain Amazing?
CASANOVA	Captain who?

CASANOVA	I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
FURIOUS	You're nuts.
CASANOVA	They always call the great ones nuts.
FURIOUS	And the nuts always call themselves great.
CASANOVA	Are you with me... or against me?
FURIOUS	Against.
CASANOVA	Too bad. PLUG HIM!

FURIOUS	Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
CASANOVA	You're dead.
FURIOUS	So are you!

CASANOVA	And the light goes out...
FURIOUS	Frankenstein!

CASANOVA	Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
FURIOUS	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

CASANOVA	I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
MONICA	Really?

CASANOVA	Are you an actress?
MONICA	Just a waitress.
CASANOVA	You underestimate yourself.

CASANOVA	You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
MONICA	Really?
CASANOVA	I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
MONICA	Sure -- I guess.
CASANOVA	Terrific.

MONICA	Hi.
CASANOVA	I thought you'd chickened out on me.
MONICA	Just wanted to... powder my nose.

MONICA	How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
CASANOVA	Why not?

MONICA	Who's the artist?
CASANOVA	Me.

CASANOVA	Come here.
MONICA	I'm not that kind of girl.
CASANOVA	Then why are you here?
MONICA	Curiosity.
CASANOVA	Remember the cat.

MONICA	I'd better go.
CASANOVA	You're a spy.
MONICA	What?
CASANOVA	I saw him walk you home.
MONICA	Who?
CASANOVA	Roy.

MONICA	Stay away!
CASANOVA	Or you'll what? CAN ME?

FURIOUS	Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
MONICA	I guess... Are you always so angry?
FURIOUS	Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

FURIOUS	Or talk?
MONICA	Not tonight. 

FURIOUS	Hi.
MONICA	Alone tonight?
FURIOUS	Every night.

FURIOUS	Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
MONICA	Date?
FURIOUS	Yeah.
MONICA	I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
FURIOUS	Sure.
MONICA	That was easy. 

MONICA	I admire you.
FURIOUS	Why?
MONICA	Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
FURIOUS	It is?
MONICA	Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
FURIOUS	I wouldn't mind being famous.
MONICA	Who wouldn't?

MONICA	I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
FURIOUS	Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
MONICA	What's your real name?
FURIOUS	Roy.
MONICA	Have you always lived here?

MONICA	Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
FURIOUS	It's home.
MONICA	Yeah.

MONICA	I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
FURIOUS	What have they got that we ain't got?
MONICA	Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
FURIOUS	Me, too.
MONICA	You don't seem very angry right now.

MONICA	You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
FURIOUS	I just want to be a superhero.
MONICA	That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

MONICA	It's me.
FURIOUS	Monica, where are you?

MONICA	At the Frankenstein Center.
FURIOUS	Are you nuts? Get out of there!
MONICA	I'm going inside.
FURIOUS	What are you talking about?
MONICA	Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
FURIOUS	He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
MONICA	Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
FURIOUS	And what if you get killed?
MONICA	Then at least I will have died trying, right?

MONICA	Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
FURIOUS	What?
MONICA	Bye. 
FURIOUS	Monica!

FURIOUS	So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

FURIOUS	If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

FURIOUS	So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
INVISIBLE BOY	I just know.

FURIOUS	Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
INVISIBLE BOY	I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?

INVISIBLE BOY	Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
FURIOUS	Good or evil, what's the difference?

FURIOUS	You're the Sphinx.
SPHINX	And you are a fool.

FURIOUS	But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
SPHINX	The wise snake coils before he strikes.
FURIOUS	And a skunk stinks!

SPHINX	You drink too much.
FURIOUS	When are you going to take off that mask?
SPHINX	When I am sure I am among friends.

SPHINX	Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
FURIOUS	My heart died a long time ago.
SPHINX	It is not dead. It is hiding.
FURIOUS	Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 

FURIOUS	Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
FURIOUS	And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
SPHINX	Now you're talking.

FURIOUS	We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
SPHINX	He is in love. His anger is gone.

SHOVELER	Oh don't start that again --
FURIOUS	LOOK!

SHOVELER	Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
FURIOUS	We had an off night, that's all.
SHOVELER	So when are we gonna have an on night?

SHOVELER	What are you talking about?
FURIOUS	What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?

SHOVELER	And it would be the right thing to do.
FURIOUS	Yeah yeah -- and that, too.

SHOVELER	I'm liking this.
FURIOUS	I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!

FURIOUS	Have you ever seen him?
SHOVELER	How could I see him if he's invisible?
FURIOUS	Good point.

FURIOUS	You sure that's how you spell it?
SHOVELER	Yeah.

SHOVELER	There's just not enough of us.
FURIOUS	But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...

SHOVELER	There's a big difference.
FURIOUS	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.

FURIOUS	You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
SHOVELER	But there's still only six of us.
FURIOUS	SO WHAT?

FURIOUS	So what else has Superman got?
SHOVELER	He's got the fact that he's Superman!

SHOVELER	This place is built like a fortress.
FURIOUS	Because that's what it is.

SHOVELER	GET MAD!
FURIOUS	But I just don't feel it.

SHOVELER	Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
FURIOUS	Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.

FURIOUS	But she still might call!
SHOVELER	Are you coming or not?
FURIOUS	I'll drive.
SHOVELER	Not a chance!

FURIOUS	Cover me!
SHOVELER	With what?

RAJA	He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
FURIOUS	What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!

FURIOUS	He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
RAJA	There's a vague similarity.
FURIOUS	A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!

FURIOUS	We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
RAJA	But look at him... and look at us.

FURIOUS	Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
RAJA	I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
FURIOUS	So why don't you just tell her!
RAJA	I can't.
FURIOUS	Why not?
RAJA	Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!

FURIOUS	Nah.
RAJA	Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
FURIOUS	What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
RAJA	So you're chicken?
FURIOUS	Who's chicken? 

RAJA	Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
FURIOUS	Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
RAJA	Or flowers.
FURIOUS	See ya tomorrow.

FURIOUS	I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
RAJA	But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

FURIOUS	Let's go.
RAJA	Wait!... Look!

FURIOUS	The who?
RAJA	The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
FURIOUS	Well they've crawled back out.

RAJA	I'm soaked.  Oh great.
FURIOUS	Shhh.

RAJA	Maybe she's right.
FURIOUS	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!

RAJA	Agents?
FURIOUS	Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!

RAJA	But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
FURIOUS	Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!

FURIOUS	Sounds good.
RAJA	No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.

RAJA	Maybe there was traffic.
FURIOUS	Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!

RAJA	Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
FURIOUS	Oh shut up.

RAJA	Roy --
FURIOUS	Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

RAJA	So where's the art?
FURIOUS	He hasn't stolen it yet.

RAJA	What's that?
FURIOUS	Come on.

RAJA	He's turned into a completely normal person!
FURIOUS	Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?

RAJA	But... only when no one is looking.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

RAJA	So you're only invisible... to yourself?
INVISIBLE BOY	No.

RAJA	So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

INVISIBLE BOY	The Obliterators!
RAJA	The Eradicators!

RAJA	Firepower costs money.
INVISIBLE BOY	Anybody got any?

RAJA	Yes, Obie-wan.
INVISIBLE BOY	Hey... he's gone.

MONICA	You guys going to a costume party?
RAJA	We're superheroes.
MONICA	Really? Like Captain Amazing?

MONICA	Are you famous?
RAJA	Not yet.
MONICA	So you're like... struggling superheroes?
RAJA	We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
MONICA	Wow.
RAJA	And these are my associates, the Shoveler.

MONICA	Really?
RAJA	Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
MONICA	So what can I get you?
RAJA	Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.

MONICA	Here you go. 
RAJA	Ow.
MONICA	Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

MOTHER	Jeffrey!
RAJA	Oh hi, Mom.
MOTHER	What are you doing in the silver drawer?
RAJA	Looking for... the TV Guide.

MOTHER	It's on the television.
RAJA	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.

MOTHER	Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
RAJA	Mother... it's not what you think!
MOTHER	And why are you wearing that silly costume?
RAJA	Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

RAJA	Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
MOTHER	But... the silverware?
RAJA	I use it... to fight evil.
MOTHER	Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
RAJA	It is?
MOTHER	I always knew that you were special.
RAJA	You did?
MOTHER	Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.

SHOVELER	Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
RAJA	We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
SHOVELER	How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?

SHOVELER	Hi.
RAJA	And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

RAJA	She likes you.
SHOVELER	Definitely.
RAJA	Ask her out.

RAJA	This is bad.
SHOVELER	Who are they?
RAJA	The Disco Boys.

SHOVELER	We may be getting in over our heads here.
RAJA	This looks like a job for Superman --
SHOVELER	Or Batman --
RAJA	Or both.

RAJA	Don't crunch the leaves.
SHOVELER	Sorry.
RAJA	Be a Mohican. 

SHOVELER	Be a Mohican.
RAJA	Shut up.

RAJA	Do we have to?
SHOVELER	I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.

RAJA	And there's the Sphinx.
SHOVELER	The who?
RAJA	He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.

RAJA	And a social life.
SHOVELER	Yeah, but how do we get to them?

SHOVELER	To us!
RAJA	Whatever our name is.

SHOVELER	Are you sure he's still lives here?
RAJA	Are you sure he's still alive?

RAJA	But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
SHOVELER	The bazookas?

RAJA	Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
SHOVELER	Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.

RAJA	He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
SHOVELER	And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.

SHOVELER	Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
RAJA	But how do we get in?

RAJA	That was too close.
SHOVELER	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

RAJA	We're outnumbered twenty to one.
SHOVELER	It's suicide.

RAJA	Oh no.
SHOVELER	Great timing!

SHOVELER	It's time.
RAJA	With or without him, we gotta go!

SHOVELER	We've got lift off!
RAJA	May the forks be with us!

SHOVELER	Where am I going?
RAJA	Through there!
SHOVELER	Right.

GABRIEL	So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
ASHLEY	Gabriel -- !
GABRIEL	Must have a way with stationery.
ASHLEY	Gabriel, what are you doing!

GABRIEL	You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
ASHLEY	Gabriel, let him go --
GABRIEL	Read a lot about you, Nick.
ASHLEY	What are you doing here?!
GABRIEL	Read you're a man of some knowledge.
ASHLEY	Gabriel!
GABRIEL	A man of some travels.
ASHLEY	GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!

GABRIEL	Is this him!?
ASHLEY	Don't hurt him...
GABRIEL	Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
ASHLEY	Please, Gabriel, don't...

GABRIEL	IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
ASHLEY	YES!!!

ASHLEY	Gabriel, you promised!
GABRIEL	I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!

ASHLEY	You promised me!
GABRIEL	And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!

GABRIEL	He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
ASHLEY	NO!

ASHLEY	Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
GABRIEL	We're talking, aren't we?

GABRIEL	He wants the money.
ASHLEY	No, baby. He wants me.

ASHLEY	He wants... your "sister"...
GABRIEL	...whoever she is.

GABRIEL	All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
ASHLEY	To all those cons...
GABRIEL	Searching for a money man...
ASHLEY	We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
GABRIEL	-- till he fucked his parole --
ASHLEY	-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
GABRIEL	That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.

GABRIEL	I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
ASHLEY	One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
GABRIEL	I've been doing good, though.
ASHLEY	Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
GABRIEL	Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
ASHLEY	What, he should see me help you catch him?

ASHLEY	He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
GABRIEL	He'll be dead when he does.

GABRIEL	Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
ASHLEY	Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...

ASHLEY	Gabriel!
GABRIEL	That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.

TEEN CLERK	You can't find... what?
ASHLEY	Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
TEEN CLERK	Toys for... adults?
ASHLEY	C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
TEEN CLERK	We sell children's toys --
ASHLEY	I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?

TEEN CLERK	Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
ASHLEY	Thank you.

RUDY	Gotta be ten degrees out there.
ASHLEY	Radio said negative five.
RUDY	Negative five?
ASHLEY	Yeah.
RUDY	I don't think it's negative five.
ASHLEY	Radio said.

ASHLEY	I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
RUDY	No, no --
ASHLEY	Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
RUDY	No, hey, I like your coat --
ASHLEY	Saw me --
RUDY	Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
ASHLEY	You are to me.

ASHLEY	Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
RUDY	I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
ASHLEY	No, no, no. Be like you want to be.

RUDY	Do that again.
ASHLEY	What.
RUDY	Smile.

ASHLEY	No --
RUDY	One more. Smile. One more.
ASHLEY	No, c'mon --
RUDY	I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.

RUDY	Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
ASHLEY	Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
RUDY	No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
ASHLEY	Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
RUDY	Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?

ASHLEY	I told you, Nick. Remember?
RUDY	Tell me again.
ASHLEY	All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
RUDY	Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
ASHLEY	Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.

RUDY	Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
ASHLEY	Yes it was all you --
RUDY	Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
ASHLEY	I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
RUDY	Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
ASHLEY	Then he shoulda signed his name.

RUDY	Where the hell are you going?
ASHLEY	Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!

RUDY	Ashley, Jesus --
ASHLEY	Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
RUDY	Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
ASHLEY	Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.

ASHLEY	You need a COAT!
RUDY	Ash, you've gotten me enough --
ASHLEY	No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!

RUDY	Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
ASHLEY	You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.

ASHLEY	You forget where I work?
RUDY	Beauty and fragrances.
ASHLEY	Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.

RUDY	Well, I don't know about that --
ASHLEY	Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
RUDY	Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
ASHLEY	And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
RUDY	We'll have more fun in Detroit.
ASHLEY	We could live it up and --
RUDY	Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.

ASHLEY	Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
RUDY	I'll see what I can do.
ASHLEY	No, lover. I'll see what you can do.

RUDY	NO!
ASHLEY	NICK!

RUDY	I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
ASHLEY	Nick...

ASHLEY	I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
RUDY	Your brother...

RUDY	...the truck driver...
ASHLEY	He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...

ASHLEY	Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
RUDY	What the fuck is going on.
ASHLEY	He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
RUDY	What's going ON!!!

RUDY	You motherfucker.
ASHLEY	Nick, no --
RUDY	You sold him out.
ASHLEY	Nick --
RUDY	When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
ASHLEY	Nick, what are you --

RUDY	I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
ASHLEY	Nick, I love you --
RUDY	JESUS CHRIST!

RUDY	Get the hell off of me!
ASHLEY	Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

ASHLEY	He'll kill you.
RUDY	You're not hearing me here --
ASHLEY	My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
RUDY	He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
ASHLEY	Nick, please, it's me --
RUDY	You told him about Nick's letters.
ASHLEY	No, Nick, no --
RUDY	You're in on this.
ASHLEY	I love you!

RUDY	Your pen palls dead, lady.
ASHLEY	If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
RUDY	Nick died for me....
ASHLEY	I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
RUDY	...maybe I die for Nick...
ASHLEY	Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!

ASHLEY	Gabriel!
RUDY	Canada.

RUDY	They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
ASHLEY	Jack. Jack Bangs.
RUDY	Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?

ASHLEY	He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
RUDY	But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.

ASHLEY	I thought we'd have a few more days.
RUDY	For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
ASHLEY	No!
RUDY	Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
ASHLEY	Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
RUDY	So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
ASHLEY	Not without you.

RUDY	Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
ASHLEY	They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
RUDY	He working for them on this one?
ASHLEY	No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
RUDY	And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
ASHLEY	What?
RUDY	Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?

RUDY	They've never done a robbery?
ASHLEY	They're truck drivers.

RUDY	Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
ASHLEY	We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
RUDY	We? What "we"...

RUDY	Get your own room, Ashley.
ASHLEY	Nick...
RUDY	Get your own room.

ASHLEY	So does it look a lot different?
RUDY	Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.

ASHLEY	That guy knows you?
RUDY	Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.

ASHLEY	Nick, what happened --
RUDY	There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.

RUDY	We get to the bridge, we're all right!
ASHLEY	Nick, the ice is --
RUDY	Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!

ASHLEY	Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
RUDY	All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...

ASHLEY	We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
RUDY	...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
ASHLEY	Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.

ASHLEY	You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
RUDY	You saved me.
ASHLEY	I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?

ASHLEY	I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
RUDY	Don't say my name...
ASHLEY	I love you, Nick...
RUDY	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

RUDY	They'll have guns.
ASHLEY	What?
RUDY	You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
ASHLEY	I don't know...
RUDY	We'll need one.

RUDY	I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
ASHLEY	Nick, what are you talking about?
RUDY	We need to find a way to make me part of it.
ASHLEY	Part of... with them?

ASHLEY	He wants to see your map.
RUDY	I'm almost done.
ASHLEY	He says he wants it now.
RUDY	If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.

ASHLEY	How are we gonna do this, Nick?
RUDY	You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
ASHLEY	Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
RUDY	Is there any way you could get into his truck?
ASHLEY	No.
RUDY	We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...

RUDY	Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
ASHLEY	They all are. Football's on.
RUDY	Keep 'em there for a little while.

RUDY	I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
ASHLEY	We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
RUDY	Well. I'm going home.

ASHLEY	WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
RUDY	Yeah. That's love.

ASHLEY	You... you... YOU --
RUDY	We still gonna spend Christmas together?

RUDY	I saved your life.
ASHLEY	You shouldn't have.
RUDY	He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
ASHLEY	Who wouldn't.

ASHLEY	Merry Christmas, Rudy.
RUDY	I'm glad it was me.
ASHLEY	Merry Christmas.

ASHLEY	What?
RUDY	Rudy. How'd you know my name?
ASHLEY	What are you talking about?

RUDY	You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
ASHLEY	I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
RUDY	No --
ASHLEY	You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
RUDY	But I never said Rudy.
ASHLEY	You said it a million times!
RUDY	I never told you my name.

RUDY	You... you don't know me --
GABRIEL	Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
RUDY	No, you can't --
GABRIEL	The hell I can't.

GABRIEL	Who are you now.
RUDY	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
GABRIEL	Put him in the truck.
RUDY	I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
GABRIEL	You what...
RUDY	I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --

GABRIEL	You're not Nick Mason...
RUDY	I shared his cell!
GABRIEL	But you were saying you were...
RUDY	Yes!
GABRIEL	So you could get with my sister.
RUDY	Yes!
GABRIEL	So you could get down her chimney.
RUDY	Yes!
GABRIEL	And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.

GABRIEL	You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
RUDY	I never worked at no casino.

GABRIEL	Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
RUDY	She says a lot of things.
GABRIEL	She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
RUDY	Wish I had a brother like you.
GABRIEL	A girl says she loves you, you say something.

RUDY	I had better sex in prison.
GABRIEL	Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.

GABRIEL	Where's she work?
RUDY	What?
GABRIEL	Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
RUDY	J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
GABRIEL	What's her middle name?
RUDY	Samantha.
GABRIEL	What'd they call her in high school?
RUDY	Bam Bam.
GABRIEL	What'd they call her in college?
RUDY	What college.
GABRIEL	Where'd she drop her cherry?

GABRIEL	Be more specific.
RUDY	A station wagon in Canada.
GABRIEL	What's her greatest fear?
RUDY	Her brother.
GABRIEL	Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
RUDY	No. It's her brother.

GABRIEL	Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
RUDY	Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.

GABRIEL	You knew the place --
RUDY	Hey.

GABRIEL	How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
RUDY	I don't know.
GABRIEL	The hell you don't.
RUDY	Five million?
GABRIEL	You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
RUDY	Christmas... Eve...
GABRIEL	You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.

RUDY	Hey, it's... been two years --
GABRIEL	We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.

RUDY	Hell. Ten?
GABRIEL	And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?

GABRIEL	What?
RUDY	I said, who the hell made the map?
GABRIEL	I did.
RUDY	This isn't the Tomahawk.
GABRIEL	What the fuck are you talking about.
RUDY	This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --

GABRIEL	We walked the place for a week.
RUDY	And I worked there. For a year.

GABRIEL	They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
RUDY	When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.

GABRIEL	So what the hell good are you...
RUDY	You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
GABRIEL	Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.

RUDY	They won't recognize me.
GABRIEL	Why not.
RUDY	Trust me. They won't recognize me.
GABRIEL	We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
RUDY	'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

GABRIEL	Bring back some memories, Nick?
RUDY	More than you know.

GABRIEL	Rather be back in the Mountain?
RUDY	Might as well be.
GABRIEL	Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.

RUDY	A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
GABRIEL	Put it on.

GABRIEL	You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
RUDY	What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
GABRIEL	You do.
RUDY	At least gimme video poker.
GABRIEL	Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.

RUDY	Do I get a country-western name?
GABRIEL	You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.

RUDY	Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
GABRIEL	Get out.

GABRIEL	You got one hour.
RUDY	I'm gonna need some money.

RUDY	Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
GABRIEL	Don't tip.
RUDY	Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.

GABRIEL	A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
RUDY	...never... tried...
GABRIEL	Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.

GABRIEL	Got something to say to me, Nick?
RUDY	...ttt..tt... two out of three?

GABRIEL	What'd you tell that casino manager?
RUDY	Nnn... nothing...
GABRIEL	You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
RUDY	Nothing... I promise-nothing...
GABRIEL	MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
RUDY	NO!

RUDY	He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
GABRIEL	I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...

GABRIEL	It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
RUDY	No, Gabriel... no...

RUDY	Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
GABRIEL	Nick. I been trying to hit you.

GABRIEL	Start singing.
RUDY	I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
GABRIEL	Sing it in pictures, Nick.

RUDY	Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
GABRIEL	What's the code?
RUDY	Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.

RUDY	So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
GABRIEL	We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
RUDY	You need six.

GABRIEL	NO.
RUDY	You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
GABRIEL	No.
RUDY	You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.

GABRIEL	I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
RUDY	Six men means six guns.
GABRIEL	No way.
RUDY	I'm no threat without a gun.
GABRIEL	No, you're not.
RUDY	There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.

GABRIEL	No gun.
RUDY	Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
GABRIEL	That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
RUDY	What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
GABRIEL	Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

RUDY	You gotta be kidding me.
GABRIEL	'Tis the season, convict.

GABRIEL	Can't be attracting attention, right?
RUDY	What, we walking in there and delivering toys?

GABRIEL	You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
RUDY	Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

GABRIEL	Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
RUDY	Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.

GABRIEL	Get in the CAR!
RUDY	How'd you know my name...

GABRIEL	Ash?
RUDY	How'd you know my name was Rudy.
GABRIEL	Ash?
RUDY	How'd you know my name.

MERLIN	Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
GABRIEL	Take 'em.
MERLIN	How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
GABRIEL	Leave the tree.

GABRIEL	Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
MERLIN	And where they hide the real money.

MERLIN	Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
GABRIEL	Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.

GABRIEL	Where the HELL did he go?
MERLIN	Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.

JACK BANGS	Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
GABRIEL	Show's over.

GABRIEL	He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
JACK BANGS	I don't know... what you're...

GABRIEL	THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
JACK BANGS	What... Powwow...
GABRIEL	The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
JACK BANGS	I don't steal any --

JACK BANGS	...so where is he?
GABRIEL	Where is he?! Where is he?!
JACK BANGS	He's not Nick Mason...

JACK BANGS	I can't go back to Vegas...
GABRIEL	OPEN IT!!!

JACK BANGS	I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
GABRIEL	GO!!!

JACK BANGS	There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
YOUNG GOVERNOR	We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS	Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
YOUNG GOVERNOR	We're aware of your position.
JACK BANGS	Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.

JACK BANGS	I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
YOUNG GOVERNOR	Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS	Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
YOUNG GOVERNOR	The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
JACK BANGS	I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
YOUNG GOVERNOR	We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.

JUMPY	The Powwow Safe?
RUDY	His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.

JUMPY	What about the Powwow Safe?
RUDY	What?
JUMPY	The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
RUDY	Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.

JUMPY	Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
RUDY	We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!

PUG	Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
MERLIN	There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
PUG	Cancer-sucker.
MERLIN	Acid-chewer.

PUG	That motherfucker --
MERLIN	And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.

PUG	Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
MERLIN	That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?

MERLIN	This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
PUG	My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
MERLIN	His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?

MERLIN	I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
PUG	I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
MERLIN	Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --

MERLIN	Thanks, sister. How are ya.
WAITRESS	Fuckin' freezing.
MERLIN	Hell yeah. You work here long?
WAITRESS	Five years. Since it opened.
MERLIN	How long ago was your makeover?
WAITRESS	My what?!
MERLIN	No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.

RUDY	...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
MERLIN	Hi, Nick.

MERLIN	You want that for here or to go?
RUDY	I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.

MERLIN	Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
RUDY	Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!

MERLIN	Having romance problems, Romeo?
RUDY	Not with you.

MERLIN	What the hell was that about --
RUDY	He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.

RUDY	What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
MERLIN	How do we take them out?
RUDY	You gotta get someone upstairs.
MERLIN	How do we do that?

MERLIN	What about the money?
RUDY	You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.

RUDY	Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
MERLIN	Where the hell's Gabriel?

MERLIN	DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
RUDY	DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

MERLIN	You knew there were guns in here!
RUDY	Merlin, I didn't know --
MERLIN	You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
RUDY	I promise you, I didn't know!

ZOOK	Monsters in the gelatin...
NICK	It's a roach, guy --
ZOOK	There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
NICK	Oh, man --

ZOOK	THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
NICK	Fuckin, Zookerman --
ZOOK	THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

NICK	What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
RUDY	Haven't thought about it.
NICK	Hell you haven't.
RUDY	Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
NICK	We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
RUDY	Ain't there yet.
NICK	Three days, man.
RUDY	Not yet.
NICK	Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.

RUDY	Hot chocolate.
NICK	What?
RUDY	Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
NICK	And a slice of pecan pie, right?
RUDY	And some pecan pie.

NICK	She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
RUDY	Yeah.
NICK	Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
RUDY	Yeah.
NICK	Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
RUDY	Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

NICK	Why you gotta say a thing like that.
RUDY	I'm just saying.
NICK	Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
RUDY	I'm just talking.
NICK	Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

RUDY	For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
NICK	Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.

RUDY	What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
NICK	Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.

RUDY	She's using a new perfume.
NICK	No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
RUDY	Oh.
NICK	Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
RUDY	Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
NICK	Shoulda written, Rudy...

RUDY	All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
NICK	Thought you hated Sidnaw.
RUDY	Just taste that Christmas turkey.
NICK	Thought you hate your old man.
RUDY	Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.

NICK	Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
RUDY	Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
NICK	Aw, Rudy.

NICK	So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
RUDY	What, working security?
NICK	No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
RUDY	I don't know, I've seen the business world.
NICK	Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.

NICK	Just a roach, Zook.
RUDY	Good for you. Protein.

NICK	Rudy, don't move --
RUDY	Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --

NICK	Don't move, Rudy!
RUDY	Standing right here, man!

RUDY	GUARD! GUARD!
NICK	Alamo...
RUDY	GUARD!!!

NICK	Jesus, Rudy --
RUDY	Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
NICK	Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
RUDY	GUARD!!!
NICK	Ash... Ashley...
RUDY	No, man! No, no, no!
NICK	Tell her... I'll be there ...
RUDY	You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
NICK	Tell Ashley... I...
RUDY	YOU TELL HER!
NICK	...be with her...

RUDY	NO!!!
NICK	...for Christmas...
RUDY	NICK!!!

NICK	Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
RUDY	She set them up. All of them.
NICK	Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
RUDY	And you set me up.
NICK	Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.

NICK	Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
RUDY	How'd you know I'd do it.
NICK	Do what?
RUDY	Walk outta there and tell her I was you.

NICK	Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
RUDY	Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
NICK	Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.

NICK	They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
RUDY	You gave them me.
NICK	I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.

RUDY	That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
OLD TIMER	I... sorry, Mister...
RUDY	That was my king!
OLD TIMER	Well...sorry...

RUDY	POP! That was My card!
OLD TIMER	But... I had a five...
RUDY	You're hitting for MY cards!

RUDY	Switch seats with me.
OLD TIMER	What? No...
RUDY	You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
OLD TIMER	I'm ninety-two years old --
RUDY	Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
OLD TIMER	There is no other table --
RUDY	THEY'LL OPEN ONE!

PUG	Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
RUDY	I'M NOT NICK!

PUG	Start talkin
RUDY	Who the hell made this map.

PUG	That's what it looks like!
RUDY	Since when? What the hell is this room?

PUG	Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
RUDY	They changed the layout.

PUG	Without having them hit the alarms.
RUDY	I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.

CAPTAIN	I hate that picture.
ALEX	Where are they?
CAPTAIN	Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
ALEX	Where are they? Last chance.
CAPTAIN	Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?

CAPTAIN	around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
ALEX	I'm looking for my friends.
CAPTAIN	See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?

CAPTAIN	How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
ALEX	You sent them. I had no choice.
CAPTAIN	Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.

CAPTAIN	It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
ALEX	You're wrong.
CAPTAIN	Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?

ALEX	Was that it? Well, ok.
CAPTAIN	I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

ALEX	What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
WALSH	Tell her... we'll get him.
ALEX	We won't.
WALSH	Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.

WALSH	Check and mate.
ALEX	Dream on.

ALEX	Two down. Two to go.
WALSH	Down? Wait, don't tell me.
ALEX	The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 

ALEX	You think I'm crazy.
WALSH	I'm thinking... that explains a lot.

ALEX	Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
WALSH	What do they do that they had to kill her?
ALEX	I was hoping you'd find out.
WALSH	Yeah. I sure will.

ALEX	Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
WALSH	We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
ALEX	The strip joint?
WALSH	I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

ALEX	Where is it? This place?
WALSH	I think we should get some support?
ALEX	What? Call the police?

DUTTON	That was a fucking hollow point!
ALEX	I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...

ALEX	Think maybe knives do?
DUTTON	Keep that thing away from me.
ALEX	This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.

DUTTON	Fuck! What do you want?
ALEX	A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
DUTTON	There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.

ALEX	You killed her. I saw it.
DUTTON	Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?

ALEX	Sssshhh. She's resting.
TOMMY	Where the fuck did you come from?
ALEX	Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.

ALEX	You lied at my trial.
TOMMY	I don't know you, man.
ALEX	Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.

TOMMY	Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
ALEX	You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
TOMMY	What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.

ALEX	One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
TOMMY	There's no scar. Corvis made it up.

ALEX	Wrong. Answer.
TOMMY	Who are you?

ALEX	What did they give you?
TOMMY	They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
ALEX	What did they give you?
TOMMY	A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.

ALEX	We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
TOOMEY	What Scar? What fucking scar?
ALEX	AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.

TOOMEY	You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
ALEX	Good thing in a situation like this.

TOOMEY	Fucking Zombie.
ALEX	The scar.
TOOMEY	There is no scar. I'm telling you.

ALEX	I heard you were looking for this.
ERLICH	You're the guy killed Dutton.
ALEX	I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.

ERLICH	Fuck. Me.
ALEX	What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?

ERLICH	Not my arm! What you fucking want?
ALEX	I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
ERLICH	Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.

ALEX	The scar. Which of you has it?
ERLICH	Nobody.

ERLICH	Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
ALEX	How can you die if you're already dead?
ERLICH	You're him. Corvis.
ALEX	I was talking about you.

ALEX	I was a friend of your sister's.
ERIN	I know her friends.
ALEX	That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.

ERIN	Yeah, no kidding.
ALEX	Your father gave them to both of you.
ERIN	And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
ALEX	Someone else did it.
ERIN	You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
ALEX	He didn't kill her.
ERIN	How do you know?
ALEX	I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
ERIN	Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!

ERIN	Daisy. How did you know?
ALEX	I told you, I knew your sister.
ERIN	You killed that cop Dutton.
ALEX	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.

ERIN	I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
ALEX	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
ERIN	You killed Lauren! You killed her!

ALEX	I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
ERIN	My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
ALEX	No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.

ALEX	From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
ERIN	No! Why are you haunting me?
ALEX	Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.

ALEX	This is where it happened. Right over here.
ERIN	Yeah, I know.

ALEX	Are you ok?
ERIN	When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
ALEX	No...
ERIN	... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.

ALEX	Erin. It's not your fault.
ERIN	It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
ALEX	No. You don't.
ERIN	Yes I do, I really do.

ALEX	This tree. Here's where it happened.
ERIN	I don't want to see!

ALEX	... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
ERIN	So you're going to kill him?
ALEX	Have to find him first.

ALEX	You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
ERIN	My father.
ALEX	All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
ERIN	I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...

ERIN	I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
ALEX	It's what Lauren would do.

ALEX	It's ok, it's ok...
ERIN	It's not. I can't take it.
ALEX	Erin. Who?
ERIN	I don't know. I found him lying there.

ALEX	... it connects you to me...
ERIN	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...

ERIN	In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
ALEX	Erin. I'll always be with you.

CAPTAIN	I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
MADDEN	Yeah, we do.
CAPTAIN	Shut up.

CAPTAIN	Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
MADDEN	I know.
CAPTAIN	You know.
MADDEN	I know the guy leaves a sign.

MADDEN	Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
CAPTAIN	Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
MADDEN	Guy dressed for Halloween?
CAPTAIN	Good for you. You do know something.

MADDEN	They botched the execution.
CAPTAIN	Could say that.
MADDEN	Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.

MADDEN	Fucking crow.
CAPTAIN	Sign of the dead come back to life.

MADDEN	How about sign of a big black bird?
CAPTAIN	The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.

MADDEN	Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
CAPTAIN	He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.

CAPTAIN	Just don't believe everything you see.
MADDEN	Doubt is a motherfucker.
CAPTAIN	Give me a hand with this sack of shit.

CAPTAIN	Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
MADDEN	You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?

CAPTAIN	Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
RANDALL	You mean Alex.
CAPTAIN	I mean Lauren.

CAPTAIN	Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
RANDALL	You killed my daughter.

CAPTAIN	An accident, Nathan.
RANDALL	She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!

CAPTAIN	I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
RANDALL	I do. Every day.
CAPTAIN	Erin knows, doesn't she?

TRACY	Anything wrong?
DUTTON	Let's hope not. License and registration please.

DUTTON	What's with your friend there?
TRACY	She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
DUTTON	But you, you've had them.
TRACY	Not tonight. Honest.

DUTTON	If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
TRACY	Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.

TRACY	You want me to walk a straight line?
DUTTON	I want you... to bend over.
TRACY	Look, can I just call a cab?
DUTTON	What did I say?

ERIN	Why are there so many?
RANDALL	Just hold on to me.

ERIN	I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
RANDALL	Honey. I just can't.
ERIN	Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
RANDALL	Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
ERIN	It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.

RANDALL	Erin!
ERIN	Watch out!

RANDALL	What were you yelling about?
ERIN	This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
RANDALL	Are you ok?
ERIN	What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!

RANDALL	What is it?
ERIN	The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.

RANDALL	What? What is it?
ERIN	Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
RANDALL	Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
ERIN	That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
RANDALL	It still doesn't mean...
ERIN	He said he'd prove it.

ERIN	I think I dropped an earring.
RANDALL	Looks like you have them both on.

ERIN	You're in with them.
RANDALL	It's not what you think.
ERIN	You killed her!
RANDALL	No.
ERIN	Stay away from me! Stay away!
RANDALL	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

RANDALL	They killed her because she found out.
ERIN	About you.
RANDALL	About them. You've got to leave it alone.

RANDALL	Sweetheart...
ERIN	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!

RANDALL	I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
ERIN	I don't believe you.
RANDALL	Please. Come inside.
ERIN	I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.

KALEN	It must have been hard, leaving your work.
ALEXANDER	The journey is part of my work.

KALEN	Now how did you get hurt?
ALEXANDER	I had an accident.
KALEN	I figured that.  What kind of accident?

KALEN	What do you do on the towers?
ALEXANDER	On the towers?
KALEN	I'm training to be a high climber.

ALEXANDER	Ah... no.
KALEN	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
ALEXANDER	'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.

ALEXANDER	... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
KALEN	And everyone looks like us?
ALEXANDER	Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.

KALEN	She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
ALEXANDER	I'm so sorry, Kalen.

ALEXANDER	How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
KALEN	What else can they do?
ALEXANDER	Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
KALEN	We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...

KALEN	There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
ALEXANDER	Where?
KALEN	The Hall of Books.
ALEXANDER	You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
KALEN	I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.

KALEN	No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
ALEXANDER	What kind of stories?
KALEN	About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...

KALEN	I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
ALEXANDER	What happened?
KALEN	He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.

ALEXANDER	I think we should go on by ourselves.
KALEN	No...
ALEXANDER	Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
KALEN	But you're only a mud carrier.
ALEXANDER	I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.

ALEXANDER	... Well, you wanted to see it.
KALEN	This is it?
ALEXANDER	Around here.

ALEXANDER	Yes.  Just about here.
KALEN	But there's nothing here.

VOX	Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
ALEXANDER	How did you know?!
VOX	I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
ALEXANDER	1899.
VOX	I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
ALEXANDER	What are you?
VOX	I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
ALEXANDER	I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
VOX	An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...

ALEXANDER	Sir... have you a name?
VOX	I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.

ALEXANDER	Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
VOX	Morlocks --
ALEXANDER	You know of them?
VOX	Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
ALEXANDER	Do you know where they live?
VOX	Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
ALEXANDER	But you escaped.
VOX	I was lucky.  The others weren't.
ALEXANDER	How have you survived so long?

VOX	Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
ALEXANDER	Can you show us where they live?

ALEXANDER	We need your help.
VOX	Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!

ALEXANDER	Because you'll never die.
VOX	Excuse me?
ALEXANDER	You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.

VOX	So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
ALEXANDER	Yes.
VOX	And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
ALEXANDER	I'm used to that.

VOX	When was his mother taken?
ALEXANDER	Last night.
VOX	Send him away.
ALEXANDER	What?
VOX	Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
ALEXANDER	Kalen... hold on a minute.

ALEXANDER	My God... I saw this.
VOX	It frightens you.
ALEXANDER	Yes...
VOX	It was meant to.

VOX	So, do we go on?
ALEXANDER	Yes.
VOX	Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
ALEXANDER	Oh, shut up.

VOX	It's what they want you to see.
ALEXANDER	This is the way in?
VOX	Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
ALEXANDER	Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.

VOX	In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
ALEXANDER	Yes... Thank you.

ALEXANDER	Machines?
VOX	Yes.
ALEXANDER	Do you know which way?

ALEXANDER	Vox?
VOX	This way.

ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
VOX	The air... the power.
ALEXANDER	Why did they built it?
VOX	The Morlocks didn't build this.

VOX	Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
ALEXANDER	What do you mean?
VOX	Trust me... You don't want to see any more.

VOX	They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
ALEXANDER	No...
VOX	How are your dreams now?

ALEXANDER	This has to end.
VOX	End...?
ALEXANDER	This has to end.

ALEXANDER	Vox --
VOX	Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...

VOX	Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
ALEXANDER	What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
VOX	Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
ALEXANDER	Vox...
VOX	I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
ALEXANDER	I won't leave you like this.
VOX	Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
ALEXANDER	I don't understand.
VOX	I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...

VOX	Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
ALEXANDER	I'll never forget this.
VOX	I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
ALEXANDER	I will...

OVERLORD	What's your name?
ALEXANDER	Alexander.
OVERLORD	Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
ALEXANDER	You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
OVERLORD	No, we created the Morlocks.
ALEXANDER	Created?
OVERLORD	You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
ALEXANDER	As slaves.
OVERLORD	To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.

OVERLORD	And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
ALEXANDER	How do you control the Morlocks?
OVERLORD	We make them see what we wish.
ALEXANDER	How?
OVERLORD	As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.

ALEXANDER	And what of the Eloi?
OVERLORD	They survived above.  Became what they are.
ALEXANDER	No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
OVERLORD	I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
ALEXANDER	But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
OVERLORD	And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
ALEXANDER	It can't all be like this...

ALEXANDER	What?
OVERLORD	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
ALEXANDER	Why would you let me go back?
OVERLORD	Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.

ALEXANDER	Say I just come back again?
OVERLORD	Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
ALEXANDER	I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.

ALEXANDER	Why?
OVERLORD	We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
ALEXANDER	So you take their best...
OVERLORD	When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
ALEXANDER	You took her because she helped me.
OVERLORD	Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.

OVERLORD	She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
ALEXANDER	A man can change his history.
OVERLORD	After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?

OVERLORD	Now will you go?
ALEXANDER	No...

OVERLORD	If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
ALEXANDER	No...
OVERLORD	It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...

OVERLORD	That was a foolish thing to do.
ALEXANDER	I'm a foolish man.

OVERLORD	I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
ALEXANDER	I know.
OVERLORD	Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?

ALEXANDER	I'm tired of running.
OVERLORD	Oh, you won't be running for long...

OVERLORD	But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
ALEXANDER	I don't think that's going to happen.
OVERLORD	And why not?
ALEXANDER	Because...

ALEXANDER	It's spectacular...
MOTORIST	Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
ALEXANDER	I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
MOTORIST	Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
ALEXANDER	How do you keep the water temperature stable?
MOTORIST	There's a cantilevered gasket on the --

MOTORIST	God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
ALEXANDER	I just love mechanical things.
MOTORIST	Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
ALEXANDER	Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
MOTORIST	Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
ALEXANDER	You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.

VOX KIOSK	May I help you?
ALEXANDER	I -- what are you?!
VOX KIOSK	I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
ALEXANDER	What's happening to the moon?!

VOX KIOSK	The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
ALEXANDER	No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
VOX KIOSK	Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
ALEXANDER	Why is it -- breaking up?
VOX KIOSK	I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --

EMMA	You're late.
ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
EMMA	Dance with me...
ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
EMMA	Trust me...

EMMA	You promised me flowers.
ALEXANDER	What?
EMMA	You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
ALEXANDER	Sorry... I was distracted.
EMMA	Well there's something new.
ALEXANDER	I need to... um... talk to you.
EMMA	Talk away, Professor.
ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?

EMMA	... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
ALEXANDER	What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
EMMA	All right, what is it now?
ALEXANDER	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
EMMA	Admiration?  My my.
ALEXANDER	I mean... well... affection.
EMMA	You're getting warmer.

ALEXANDER	Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
EMMA	And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?

EMMA	You know, the moment is rather dying here.
ALEXANDER	Hold on... I know I have it...

ALEXANDER	I know it's not a diamond but --
EMMA	A moonstone.
ALEXANDER	Your birth stone.  I thought --

EMMA	You're late.
ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
EMMA	Dance with me...
ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
EMMA	Trust me...

EMMA	Alex, what is it?
ALEXANDER	Holding you... again.
EMMA	Darling.
ALEXANDER	I need... to talk to you.
EMMA	All right...
ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  Please.

EMMA	Let's walk through the park...
ALEXANDER	No... let's walk through the city.
EMMA	All right...

EMMA	Alex, what is it?
ALEXANDER	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.

EMMA	Alex...?!
ALEXANDER	Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?

EMMA	Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
ALEXANDER	I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...

ALEXANDER	My God...
EMMA	Alex, it's just the zoo.

EMMA	You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
ALEXANDER	No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
EMMA	We took a walk three days ago.
ALEXANDER	Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.

EMMA	They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
ALEXANDER	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
EMMA	So it's astronomy now, is it?

EMMA	Heavens, look at that now!
ALEXANDER	I've seen it.

EMMA	Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
ALEXANDER	It's only a machine.

EMMA	Alex... people are staring.
ALEXANDER	Let them.

EMMA	Let them.
ALEXANDER	I have something for you...

ALEXANDER	... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
PHILBY	Do you know you were humming?
ALEXANDER	I was not.
PHILBY	Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
ALEXANDER	Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
PHILBY	Tonight's the night?
ALEXANDER	God, and I'm running late --

ALEXANDER	... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
PHILBY	You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
ALEXANDER	Where's the challenge in that?
PHILBY	Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
ALEXANDER	You sound like my father...

ALEXANDER	Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
PHILBY	I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
ALEXANDER	I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
PHILBY	You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
ALEXANDER	But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?

ALEXANDER	In the future, we'll be better.
PHILBY	What?
ALEXANDER	Nothing.

ALEXANDER	Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
PHILBY	How romantic...

PHILBY	The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
ALEXANDER	That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
PHILBY	She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
ALEXANDER	Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
PHILBY	No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?

PHILBY	Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
ALEXANDER	Oh?
PHILBY	She's gotten into your equations.

PHILBY	All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
ALEXANDER	Perseverance.

ALEXANDER	I've been working.
PHILBY	I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, David.
PHILBY	It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
ALEXANDER	Then why are you here?

PHILBY	It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
ALEXANDER	For God's Sake, David --
PHILBY	There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
ALEXANDER	You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
PHILBY	But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
ALEXANDER	Hiding?
PHILBY	You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
ALEXANDER	That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
PHILBY	I care more about my life.  And yours.

PHILBY	What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
ALEXANDER	I live with it every minute of every day.
PHILBY	I know that --
ALEXANDER	You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
PHILBY	It wasn't your fault, Alex.
ALEXANDER	Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
PHILBY	Do you find her?

PHILBY	Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
ALEXANDER	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.

ALEXANDER	David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
PHILBY	What is it?
ALEXANDER	You wouldn't believe me.
PHILBY	I would.
ALEXANDER	I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
PHILBY	Why don't you come to our house instead?
ALEXANDER	I can't do that --
PHILBY	When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
ALEXANDER	I can't leave when I'm so close.
PHILBY	There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
ALEXANDER	That's absurd --
PHILBY	You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!

ALEXANDER	You won't say that in a week.
PHILBY	I pray to God that in a week you're not here.

PHILBY	All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
ALEXANDER	In a week... we will never have had this conversation.

ALEXANDER	Good night, David.
PHILBY	Good night, Alex.

ALEXANDER	And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
PHILBY	I'm glad.

ALEXANDER	This... was my home.
PHILBY	His home.

THIN MAN	Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
ALEXANDER	Thank you...
THIN MAN	I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
ALEXANDER	Sir...?
THIN MAN	And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
ALEXANDER	I don't understand.

THIN MAN	Did you hear me, lad?
ALEXANDER	All right, all right -- here -- everything --

MARA	You're up!  You must be feeling better --
ALEXANDER	Yes...

MARA	How long did you travel?
ALEXANDER	Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.

MARA	Yes.
ALEXANDER	Thank you.

MARA	Is there a lot of illness?
ALEXANDER	Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.

ALEXANDER	His curiosity is amazing.
MARA	Mm.

MARA	Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
ALEXANDER	Your husband is dead?
MARA	He's gone to a better place.

ALEXANDER	It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
MARA	You're not from beyond the valley.
ALEXANDER	What makes you say that?

MARA	We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
ALEXANDER	You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
MARA	Then you can speak slowly.

MARA	Oh, that explains everything.
ALEXANDER	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
MARA	That machine --
ALEXANDER	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
MARA	How long ago?
ALEXANDER	More than 800,000 years.

MARA	Why?
ALEXANDER	Why not?
MARA	Why would you do that?

MARA	I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
ALEXANDER	Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
MARA	I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
ALEXANDER	For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --

ALEXANDER	Is he all right?
MARA	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.

MARA	I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
ALEXANDER	I will...

MARA	I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
ALEXANDER	Thank you...

MARA	You seem fascinated by the stars.
ALEXANDER	You can see so many here.
MARA	Don't then have stars where you come from?
ALEXANDER	Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...

MARA	Good night, then.
ALEXANDER	Good night.

ALEXANDER	Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
MARA	Then you came to a desert and mountains...
ALEXANDER	Yes.
MARA	And you saw a shape ahead of you...
ALEXANDER	Yes!
MARA	We all have that dream.
ALEXANDER	All of you?
MARA	Every night.
ALEXANDER	You share dreams?  That's incredible.
MARA	We share everything.

ALEXANDER	This is magnificent...
MARA	Thank you.
ALEXANDER	And this is your "work"?
MARA	Yes.

MARA	The mud carriers.
ALEXANDER	I can see Kalen's point.
MARA	Want to be a high climber now, do you?
ALEXANDER	What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
MARA	It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
MARA	I don't understand.
ALEXANDER	I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
MARA	It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
ALEXANDER	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
MARA	It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
ALEXANDER	Or mud carriers.
MARA	And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
ALEXANDER	What are you?
MARA	I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
ALEXANDER	How do you decide?
MARA	I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.

ALEXANDER	... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
MARA	You liked it there.
ALEXANDER	Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
MARA	Learning was important?
ALEXANDER	Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
MARA	Did you have fires at night?
ALEXANDER	Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
MARA	It must have been safe.
ALEXANDER	Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
MARA	It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
ALEXANDER	Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...

MARA	Alexander...?
ALEXANDER	Orion's belt...

ALEXANDER	Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
MARA	You know this?
ALEXANDER	Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.

ALEXANDER	This is where my journey started... right here.
MARA	You lost someone.
ALEXANDER	Yes.
MARA	Someone you loved very much.
ALEXANDER	Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
MARA	Is it?
ALEXANDER	If you only knew...

ALEXANDER	You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
MARA	I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.

ALEXANDER	Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
MARA	It's undamaged?
ALEXANDER	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
MARA	So you can use it now?
ALEXANDER	Yes... I suppose so.
MARA	Go back to your own time?
ALEXANDER	I could...

MARA	Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
ALEXANDER	Mara --
MARA	Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --

MARA	Kalen...
ALEXANDER	Mara...?
MARA	No!

ALEXANDER	Mara -- what -- ?!
MARA	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !

MARA	It was different then.
ALEXANDER	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.

MRS. WATCHIT	Oh huzzah, the master's home.
ALEXANDER	Do you have it?!
MRS. WATCHIT	Hello, Mr. Philby.

ALEXANDER	Don't torture me -- do you have it?
MRS. WATCHIT	I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
ALEXANDER	What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?

MRS. WATCHIT	Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
ALEXANDER	Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
MRS. WATCHIT	Oh, I'm already swooning.
ALEXANDER	Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.

MRS. WATCHIT	Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
ALEXANDER	Here?
MRS. WATCHIT	Yes, sir, he --
ALEXANDER	Tell him to go away --

ALEXANDER	All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
MRS. WATCHIT	May I get you some --
ALEXANDER	That'll be all.

DEAN FULTON	Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
ALEXANDER	I see.
DEAN FULTON	As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
ALEXANDER	Exactly correct, sir.

DEAN FULTON	Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
ALEXANDER	Imagine that.
DEAN FULTON	But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
ALEXANDER	Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
DEAN FULTON	Might I ask why?
ALEXANDER	Because the assigned curriculum is boring.

ALEXANDER	Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
DEAN FULTON	Do they?

ALEXANDER	And roosters.
DEAN FULTON	No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
ALEXANDER	No, sir --
DEAN FULTON	Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
ALEXANDER	Sir --

ALEXANDER	With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
DEAN FULTON	The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
ALEXANDER	My equations are not parlor-tricks!
DEAN FULTON	Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
ALEXANDER	Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!

ALEXANDER	Yes, sir.
DEAN FULTON	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.

KORUS	And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
ALEXANDER	I did...
KORUS	Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.

ALEXANDER	Eloi?
KORUS	What are your people called?
ALEXANDER	Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
KORUS	New Yorkers.

KORUS	We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
ALEXANDER	No...
KORUS	He said he traveled for two months.
ALEXANDER	I took a different route.

ALEXANDER	Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
KORUS	Why?
ALEXANDER	To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
KORUS	New Yorkers.
ALEXANDER	Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?

KORUS	I am the oldest.
ALEXANDER	No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
KORUS	My father has gone to a better place.
ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
KORUS	Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?

KORUS	Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
ALEXANDER	I suppose so.

ALEXANDER	Where do they take them?!
KORUS	We don't know.
ALEXANDER	We have to go after them, find where -- !
KORUS	Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
ALEXANDER	What do you mean?!
KORUS	They've gone to a better place.
ALEXANDER	You know that's not true.
KORUS	We choose to believe it.
ALEXANDER	My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --

KORUS	This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
ALEXANDER	Then it's time to change that --
KORUS	We are what we are.

ALEXANDER	You won't even try?
KORUS	We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.

DEAN FULTON	My fowl have polluted the yard.
PHILBY	Dean Fulton...

PHILBY	Sir, if I may --
DEAN FULTON	Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?

PHILBY	If I might explain, sir --
DEAN FULTON	You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
PHILBY	Yes, sir.
DEAN FULTON	Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.

KALEN	How did you get hurt?
MARA	Kalen...
KALEN	I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
MARA	That's quite enough, Kalen.

KALEN	What did you do at night?
MARA	What's it like where you come from?

MARA	We'll see about that.
KALEN	I am.  Are you a climber?

KALEN	I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
MARA	Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
KALEN	You'll tell me more tomorrow?

MARA	Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
KALEN	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
MARA	No, you're safe --
KALEN	They're inside --
MARA	Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...

PHILBY	Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
MRS. WATCHIT	Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.

PHILBY	I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
MRS. WATCHIT	For our sake, I hope not.

MRS. WATCHIT	I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
PHILBY	And you've no idea where he went?
MRS. WATCHIT	No, sir.

MRS. WATCHIT	Sir?
PHILBY	I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.

MRS. WATCHIT	I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
PHILBY	I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
MRS. WATCHIT	Goodnight, Mr. Philby.

CORBETT	You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.

CORBETT	Needs patching.

CORBETT	Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.

CORBETT	Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.

CORBETT	Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?

CORBETT	See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.

CORBETT	Wait 'til I'm across!

CORBETT	You talk about ecology -- there it is.

CORBETT	Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.

CORBETT	Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.

CORBETT	First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.

CORBETT	What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?

CORBETT	Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

CORBETT	Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.

CORBETT	So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.

ERIC	Avalanche season is coming.

ERIC	I'll get you there all right.

ERIC	Let's go.

ERIC	It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.

ERIC	I just want this over with.

ERIC	How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.

ERIC	...I won't let a killer walk!

ERIC	There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.

ERIC	I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.

ERIC	You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.

ERIC	Your infrared camera?

ERIC	Keep back.

WILDER	I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.

WILDER	Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.

WILDER	Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.

WILDER	A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-

WILDER	Back against the bars.  Now.

CORBETT	How long have you been up north?
ANNE MARIE	Six months.
CORBETT	Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.

ANNE MARIE	My dad was a Navy doctor.
CORBETT	Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
ANNE MARIE	Had?
CORBETT	She's dead.
ANNE MARIE	Oh.
CORBETT	Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
ANNE MARIE	How did she..?
CORBETT	I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-

CORBETT	What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
ANNE MARIE	That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.

CORBETT	You should know something.
ANNE MARIE	I don't want to talk any more.
CORBETT	Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --

ANNE MARIE	Have you talked to Eric?
MEYERLING	I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
ANNE MARIE	I was hoping you had some news --

MEYERLING	-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
ANNE MARIE	-- Corbett's a killer.

MEYERLING	What happened here?
ANNE MARIE	The radio's on the fritz.
MEYERLING	Where'd you say Eric is?
ANNE MARIE	Somewhere along the pipeline.
MEYERLING	What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
ANNE MARIE	Sam?  We haven't seen him.
MEYERLING	Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
ANNE MARIE	Why?
MEYERLING	It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.

ERIC	He's coming around fine.
ANNE MARIE	Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.

ANNE MARIE	What are you doing?
ERIC	He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.

ERIC	Stay here.
ANNE MARIE	Be careful -- there're two of them.

ANNE MARIE	Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
ERIC	Bastards took off, though, didn't they?

ERIC	Thanks.
ANNE MARIE	I bet you haven't had lunch.

ANNE MARIE	I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
ERIC	Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
ANNE MARIE	The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.

ERIC	I'll go into town with you.
ANNE MARIE	Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
ERIC	No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.

ANNE MARIE	Did you catch Corbett?
ERIC	Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
ANNE MARIE	Was there any trouble?
ERIC	He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
ANNE MARIE	Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
ERIC	Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.

ANNE MARIE	Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
ERIC	You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
ANNE MARIE	I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
ERIC	You make it sound like a prison sentence.
ANNE MARIE	That's not what I meant.
ERIC	It's exactly what you meant.
ANNE MARIE	Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
ERIC	-- Permanently?
ANNE MARIE	Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally

ANNE MARIE	I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
ERIC	I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.

ANNE MARIE	Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
ERIC	Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
ANNE MARIE	Not me.  I'm equipped.

ANNE MARIE	High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
ERIC	Come here...

ERIC	Let's go.
ANNE MARIE	Wait a second.

ANNE MARIE	Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
ERIC	Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.

ERIC	Be careful, okay?
ANNE MARIE	That's my line.

ANNE MARIE	Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
ERIC	You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
ANNE MARIE	What's going on?
ERIC	I'll tell you everything later.
ANNE MARIE	Where's Corbett?
ERIC	Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
ANNE MARIE	So what's the problem?

ERIC	Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
ANNE MARIE	I'm staying.

ANNE MARIE	You're hurt.
ERIC	Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.

ANNE MARIE	Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
ERIC	I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.

ERIC	When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
ANNE MARIE	My home is here.  With you.

CORBETT	Leave it here.
MITCHELL	Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
CORBETT	Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.

CORBETT	Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
MITCHELL	I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.

CORBETT	Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
MITCHELL	Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
CORBETT	Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.

ERIC	You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
CORBETT	Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
ERIC	I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.

ERIC	Ben Corbett?
CORBETT	Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
ERIC	Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
CORBETT	No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?

ERIC	Desmond.
CORBETT	New to the country, kid?
ERIC	Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
CORBETT	Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.

CORBETT	Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
ERIC	Yeah.  Maybe so.

CORBETT	A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
ERIC	-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.

CORBETT	Does he have people?
ERIC	A daughter in Oregon.
CORBETT	Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.

CORBETT	Surviving is what I know --
ERIC	-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.

ERIC	How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
CORBETT	Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.

CORBETT	Been driving long?
ERIC	I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
CORBETT	That makes the flight more interesting.

ERIC	Sounds like professional jealousy.
CORBETT	Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.

ERIC	Stay put!
CORBETT	You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?

ERIC	Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
CORBETT	I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
ERIC	With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
CORBETT	You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.

CORBETT	I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
ERIC	That's right.  You're not.
CORBETT	Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.

CORBETT	Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
ERIC	I don't plan on dying.

ERIC	We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
CORBETT	Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.

CORBETT	Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
ERIC	-- Turn around.

CORBETT	Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
ERIC	We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
CORBETT	We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
ERIC	I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.

CORBETT	Be my guest.
ERIC	I'm right behind you.

CORBETT	Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
ERIC	It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
CORBETT	Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
ERIC	We've got another two hours of daylight.
CORBETT	Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.

CORBETT	Have to backtrack, find another way down.
ERIC	Forget it.  It would take days.
CORBETT	Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.

CORBETT	Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
ERIC	It could blow over tomorrow, too.
CORBETT	I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.

CORBETT	Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
ERIC	You know Meyerling?
CORBETT	Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.

CORBETT	Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
ERIC	I'm here to do my job.
CORBETT	You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-

CORBETT	Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
ERIC	Yeah?
CORBETT	Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.

CORBETT	There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
ERIC	Too bad we're heading west.
CORBETT	There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
ERIC	You don't get it, do you?

CORBETT	Have to get these wet things off.
ERIC	You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!

ERIC	Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
CORBETT	If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.

CORBETT	Told you I'm fine!
ERIC	How many do you see?
CORBETT	What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
ERIC	You don't feel cold?
CORBETT	It's a spring day...

ERIC	Stay still.
CORBETT	Where's my ELT?
ERIC	Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
CORBETT	You got one?
ERIC	It was blown up with the plane.
CORBETT	Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.

CORBETT	I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
ERIC	An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
CORBETT	Hate to disappoint you.

ERIC	Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
CORBETT	Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
ERIC	Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
CORBETT	You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.

CORBETT	Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
ERIC	Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
CORBETT	All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-

ERIC	What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
CORBETT	I'm real sad you don't approve of me.

ERIC	Don't push me..!
CORBETT	Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.

ERIC	They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
CORBETT	Don't bet on it.
ERIC	I already have.
CORBETT	You don't know how true that is.

ERIC	Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
CORBETT	Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-

CORBETT	Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
ERIC	You broke the radio, remember?
CORBETT	I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.

CORBETT	You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
ERIC	I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
CORBETT	You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.

ERIC	Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
CORBETT	Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
ERIC	No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-

CORBETT	Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
ERIC	Shut up!

ERIC	Answer and I'll shoot!
CORBETT	You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.

CORBETT	Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
ERIC	Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
CORBETT	The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-

ERIC	Can you walk?
CORBETT	Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
ERIC	Let's get out of here.

ERIC	How come you didn't let him shoot me?
CORBETT	Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
ERIC	We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.

CORBETT	Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
ERIC	You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.

CORBETT	Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
WILDER	Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
CORBETT	Just passing through.

CORBETT	Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
WILDER	I'm living proof of that sad fact.
CORBETT	Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
WILDER	No, I better stay at my post.

CORBETT	You wouldn't shoot anyone...
WILDER	But I would.

CORBETT	All this for laying traps on private land?
WILDER	You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.

CORBETT	Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
WILDER	I got it from here.  Thanks.
CORBETT	Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?

CORBETT	Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
WILDER	If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
CORBETT	I'll get loose before that plane comes.
WILDER	Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.

WILDER	You better get some sleep.
CORBETT	Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.

WILDER	Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
CORBETT	I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
WILDER	I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
CORBETT	Nothing personal.

ERIC	I need to rent a cabin.
KENAI	What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
ERIC	Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
KENAI	Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
ERIC	-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
KENAI	-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
ERIC	If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.

NEFF	Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
ERIC	Sure.
NEFF	Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.

NEFF	You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
ERIC	Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
NEFF	Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
ERIC	Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
NEFF	-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
ERIC	Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.

NEFF	If Corbett's men find out --
ERIC	-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
NEFF	Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
ERIC	Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.

NEFF	What's wrong?
ERIC	Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!

NEFF	I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
ERIC	Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
NEFF	I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.

NEFF	Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
ERIC	What are you talking about?
NEFF	Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
ERIC	There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
NEFF	I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.

ERIC	You don't care enough about Sam to --
NEFF	-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

ERIC	Neff, you know better than this...
NEFF	You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.

MEYERLING	Alleged killer.
ERIC	What does this matter to you?
MEYERLING	You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
ERIC	I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
MEYERLING	This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
ERIC	Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.

MEYERLING	Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
ERIC	Fuck you.
MEYERLING	This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.

WILDER	Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
ERIC	-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.

WILDER	What'd you say they call these spaceships?
ERIC	Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.

ERIC	Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
WILDER	Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
ERIC	We'll go with you.

WILDER	I'm too old for this shit.
ERIC	Any idea who could've done it?

WILDER	...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
ERIC	That's what we should've done in the first place.
WILDER	I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.

NEFF	Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
KENAI	I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.

NEFF	Why the smirk?
KENAI	Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
NEFF	You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
KENAI	Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
NEFF	Stay out of it.

NEFF	He saw you and Corbett come in...
KENAI	Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.

NEFF	Dead.  Trappers killed him.
KENAI	Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?

VIKING BOB	LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
LEMALLE	Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...

LEMALLE	There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
VIKING BOB	It's a long shot.

VIKING BOB	I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
LEMALLE	Get the fuck out of here.
VIKING BOB	It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
LEMALLE	Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.

VIKING BOB	Go easy.
LEMALLE	Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.

LEMALLE	I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
VIKING BOB	What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
LEMALLE	Not in the right hands it ain't.

LEMALLE	Thought that door was open last night...
VIKING BOB	Quit fucking around.  Get in.

VIKING BOB	Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
LEMALLE	I'm right fuckin' here with you.

LEMALLE	You hear me?  Ben?
VIKING BOB	Ease off.  We do this my way.

LEMALLE	Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
VIKING BOB	Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.

MITCHELL	...Ben never sent a signal.
VIKING BOB	Musta never got a chance to -more-

MITCHELL	Meaning he'll need a plane.
VIKING BOB	Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
MITCHELL	Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.

MITCHELL	Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
VIKING BOB	That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?

VIKING BOB	Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
MITCHELL	We were just talking about him.

MITCHELL	It's Sam Wilder!
VIKING BOB	Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
MITCHELL	Where's the kid?

VIKING BOB	There's what they're waiting on!
MITCHELL	They'll have to come right past us.

WILDER	This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
STATE POLICEMAN	On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
WILDER	Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
STATE POLICEMAN	Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
WILDER	This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
STATE POLICEMAN	So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --

ALFRED	The dreams again, sir?
BRUCE	I think they're getting worse.
ALFRED	It's a wonder you sleep at all.

ALFRED	...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
BRUCE	Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
ALFRED	Hardly a worry, sir.

BRUCE	How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
ALFRED	A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
BRUCE	It'll never work.
ALFRED	I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.

ALFRED	Scholarly research?
BRUCE	She has an excellent mind.
ALFRED	If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
BRUCE	I wonder if she'd go out with me.
ALFRED	Apology hastily retracted.

BRUCE	Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
ALFRED	Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
BRUCE	...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
ALFRED	I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
BRUCE	I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.

BRUCE	Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
ALFRED	Ninety-three, including the sauna.
BRUCE	Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...

BRUCE	It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
ALFRED	What did you say?
BRUCE	He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
ALFRED	No. You said I. I killed them.
BRUCE	Don't be ridiculous.

ALFRED	Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
BRUCE	Is he all right?
ALFRED	I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
BRUCE	He ran away?
ALFRED	Actually, he took the car.
BRUCE	He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
ALFRED	Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
BRUCE	The _Rolls_?
ALFRED	_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!

BRUCE	Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
ALFRED	I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.

BRUCE	Maybe they're right.
ALFRED	Which `they' might that be, sir?
BRUCE	Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.

BRUCE	Why do I keep doing this?
ALFRED	Why, indeed?
BRUCE	Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
ALFRED	Dr. Meridian...

BRUCE	She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
ALFRED	Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
BRUCE	How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?

ALFRED	How are you feeling, young man?
BRUCE	Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
ALFRED	Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
BRUCE	As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
ALFRED	Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.

BRUCE	I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
ALFRED	Perhaps the fall...
BRUCE	There's one other thing. I feel..
ALFRED	What?
BRUCE	...Afraid.
ALFRED	Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
BRUCE	...A bat.
ALFRED	What?
BRUCE	I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
ALFRED	No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.

ALFRED	Master, Bruce?
BRUCE	...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.

BRUCE	All the answers are numbers.
ALFRED	But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
BRUCE	What do maniacs always want?
ALFRED	Recognition, of course.
BRUCE	Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.

BRUCE	Letters in the alphabet.
ALFRED	Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
BRUCE	How about, MR. E.
ALFRED	Mystery.
BRUCE	And another name for Mystery?
ALFRED	Enigma.
BRUCE	Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.

ALFRED	What now sir?
BRUCE	Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
ALFRED	All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
BRUCE	Tonight's a good night.

ALFRED	Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
DICK	How ya doin', Al?
ALFRED	Al?
DICK	Big house. How many rooms?

ALFRED	May I help you, Master Grayson?
DICK	How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
ALFRED	Master Wayne's dead wives.

DICK	Up here, Al.
ALFRED	Just checking, young sir.
DICK	Four seconds from...

CHASE	_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
BATMAN	And you are?

BATMAN	...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
CHASE	I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
BATMAN	Why's that?
CHASE	Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
BATMAN	Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
CHASE	I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?

CHASE	He's home. I sent the signal.
BATMAN	What's wrong?
CHASE	Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.

CHASE	I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
BATMAN	Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
CHASE	A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
BATMAN	It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
CHASE	What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.

CHASE	Now black rubber.
BATMAN	Try a fireman. Less to take off.
CHASE	I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.

BATMAN	We all wear masks.
CHASE	My life's an open book. You read?
BATMAN	I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
CHASE	We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
BATMAN	You are direct, aren't you?
CHASE	You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?

BATMAN	I haven't had much luck with women...
CHASE	Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...

BATMAN	Help Chase. I'll be back.
CHASE	Did Two-Face call him Bruce?

RIDDLER	Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
BATMAN	No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

BATMAN	Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
RIDDLER	Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.

BATMAN	Wait. I have a riddle for you.
RIDDLER	For _me_? Really? Tell me.
BATMAN	I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
RIDDLER	Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
BATMAN	Exactly!

BRUCE	Mr...?
EDWARD	Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
BRUCE	Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
EDWARD	Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.

BRUCE	I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
EDWARD	What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
BRUCE	Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
EDWARD	Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!

BRUCE	Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
EDWARD	Wait. You can't go.
BRUCE	We'll talk some other -
EDWARD	No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!

EDWARD	So glad you could come.
BRUCE	What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
EDWARD	The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...

BRUCE	What? Oh, it's very impressive.
EDWARD	Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.

EDWARD	No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
BRUCE	Nostrovia.
EDWARD	La'chiem.
BRUCE	Slanta.
EDWARD	Rinka.
BRUCE	Banzai.

EDWARD	I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
BRUCE	Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.

CHASE	How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
BRUCE	Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.

CHASE	Psychiatrists make you nervous?
BRUCE	Just ones this beautiful.
CHASE	The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
BRUCE	On occasion. Usually at night.

BRUCE	Still play with dolls, Doctor?
CHASE	She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
BRUCE	Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.

CHASE	My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
BRUCE	Wacko? That a technical term?
CHASE	Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
BRUCE	So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
CHASE	Exactly.

CHASE	I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
BRUCE	So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
CHASE	What do you know about obsession?
BRUCE	Not much.

BRUCE	It's a stretch but I'll manage.
CHASE	The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
BRUCE	To kill me.
CHASE	You understand obsession better than you let on.
BRUCE	No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
CHASE	That's usually my line.
BRUCE	Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
CHASE	Would you? I'm not so sure.
BRUCE	But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
CHASE	Excuse me.
BRUCE	And into a black dress.

CHASE	I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
BRUCE	I'm sorry. Who are you?

CHASE	Like normal folks.
BRUCE	What? This isn't normal?

BRUCE	That kid is amazing.
CHASE	I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE	Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
CHASE	The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
BRUCE	Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.

BRUCE	Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
CHASE	Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
BRUCE	But...
CHASE	Well, I met someone...
BRUCE	Fast work. You just moved here.
CHASE	You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
BRUCE	He sure did.
CHASE	What?
BRUCE	I said I'm sure he did.

BRUCE	The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
CHASE	Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?

BRUCE	A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
CHASE	And now....
BRUCE	They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....

CHASE	Find anything interesting?
BRUCE	Why do I feel like the other man, here?
CHASE	Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
BRUCE	I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
CHASE	What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?

CHASE	Why do you do that?
BRUCE	What?
CHASE	Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
BRUCE	I'm not-
CHASE	You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?

CHASE	In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
BRUCE	Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.

CHASE	If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
BRUCE	Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
CHASE	Touchy, touchy.
BRUCE	So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
CHASE	Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
BRUCE	Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?

BRUCE	And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
CHASE	Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-

BRUCE	There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
CHASE	Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?

CHASE	Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
BRUCE	I don't want to remember!
CHASE	Stop fighting.

BRUCE	My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
CHASE	What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
BRUCE	I don't-.
CHASE	You do know. Try.

BRUCE	The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
CHASE	Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
BRUCE	...Not the bat?
CHASE	What?
BRUCE	I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
CHASE	What are you talking about?
BRUCE	Chase. There's something I need to tell you--

DICK	Okay. I'm outta here.
BRUCE	Excuse me.
DICK	I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.

BRUCE	Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
DICK	I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
BRUCE	Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
DICK	Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.

DICK	I need to be part of this.
BRUCE	Absolutely not.
DICK	Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
BRUCE	What I do isn't about revenge.

DICK	Back off, man.
BRUCE	You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
DICK	Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.

BRUCE	What the hell did you think you were doing?
DICK	You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
BRUCE	How about Richard Grayson, college student?
DICK	...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
BRUCE	We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
DICK	I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.

DICK	You can't-.
BRUCE	Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
DICK	But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
BRUCE	And when you finally get Two-Face?

BRUCE	Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
DICK	Bruce, you can't.
BRUCE	Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.

CHASE	Chase?
EDWARD	Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?

CHASE	Edward...
EDWARD	Who is it?
CHASE	It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
EDWARD	How could I forget?
CHASE	Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
EDWARD	Yesssssss. I know!

CHASE	Who is The Batman, Edward?
EDWARD	Can't tell if you don't say please.
CHASE	You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.

STICKLEY	I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
EDWARD	Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?

EDWARD	Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
STICKLEY	Paranoid? The psychotic?
EDWARD	...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.

EDWARD	Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
STICKLEY	Fred?

EDWARD	I'll show you it works.
STICKLEY	What the hell is going on here?

EDWARD	Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
STICKLEY	...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
EDWARD	I don't think so.

TWO-FACE	_We_ sure are.
GUARD	...You gonna kill me?
TWO-FACE	Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
GUARD	I got family. ...Please.
TWO-FACE	What say we flip for it?

TWO-FACE	...or death.
GUARD	Please. I swear I won't say noth-
TWO-FACE	The coin _wants_ to decide.

TWO-FACE	That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
GUARD	Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
TWO-FACE	Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?

GUARD	Wait! You said you'd let me go!
TWO-FACE	Never heard of a double-cross?

TWO-FACE	How'd you find us?
RIDDLER	You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
TWO-FACE	Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.

RIDDLER	Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
TWO-FACE	A man with a death wish.
RIDDLER	Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
TWO-FACE	Let's see if you bleed green.

TWO-FACE	Holy shit.
RIDDLER	So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.

TWO-FACE	No.  Wait...
RIDDLER	Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?

TWO-FACE	Where are you sending Batboy this time?
RIDDLER	Here. Get a good seat.

TWO-FACE	Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
RIDDLER	Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.

RIDDLER	Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
TWO-FACE	Don't bogart that 'trode.

TWO-FACE	Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
RIDDLER	About what?
TWO-FACE	Everything.

TWO-FACE	Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
RIDDLER	Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.

RIDDLER	Go ahead. You can say it.
TWO-FACE	You're a genius.

TWO-FACE	We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
RIDDLER	Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!

RIDDLER	A-14.
TWO-FACE	Miss.

TWO-FACE	B-12.
RIDDLER	A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.

TWO-FACE	A hit.
RIDDLER	You sunk my battleship.

JEFFREY	I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
AUNT BARBARA	You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
JEFFREY	Yeah. How's Dad?

AUNT BARBARA	I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
JEFFREY	Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

AUNT BARBARA	Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
JEFFREY	No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

JEFFREY	Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
AUNT BARBARA	I'm not sick.

JEFFREY	Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
AUNT BARBARA	Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
JEFFREY	Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
AUNT BARBARA	I've seen a few.
JEFFREY	Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
AUNT BARBARA	Okay honey.

JEFFREY	I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
AUNT BARBARA	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
JEFFREY	Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.

JEFFREY	Are you Detective Williams?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes.
JEFFREY	My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
JEFFREY	He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	You did? A human ear?
JEFFREY	Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
JEFFREY	Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Come into the study a minute.
JEFFREY	Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
JEFFREY	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
JEFFREY	It must be great.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Jeffrey?
JEFFREY	Yes?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

JEFFREY	These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay.
JEFFREY	Anything you can tell me?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	The criminals are winning.
JEFFREY	Is that why you say it's horrible?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes.
JEFFREY	I guess you've seen some bad things.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
JEFFREY	Why do you do it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
JEFFREY	Yeah. I get it.

JEFFREY	What is this? What color is it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

JEFFREY	What color is it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	It's blue. blue velvet.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Jeffrey! Come on in.
JEFFREY	Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
JEFFREY	Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Okay?
JEFFREY	Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.

JEFFREY	And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
JEFFREY	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
JEFFREY	I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Is Sandy part of this?
JEFFREY	No. not at all.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Who knows you have these?
JEFFREY	Only you. and the photo lab.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	You're all through with this now?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
JEFFREY	Yes sir.

JEFFREY	Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
JEFFREY	Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
JEFFREY	Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS	Not yet.
JEFFREY	Oh my God. Is her son OK?

DOROTHY	Hello, baby.

JEFFREY	Who, Dorothy?
DOROTHY	Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

DOROTHY	Hold me, Don.
JEFFREY	Don?. Where is he?
DOROTHY	HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
JEFFREY	I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
DOROTHY	Hold me. I'M FALLING!

F.B.I. MAN	We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
JEFFREY	He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
F.B.I. MAN	You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
JEFFREY	Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
F.B.I. MAN	We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
JEFFREY	Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?

JEFFREY	No thanks.
FRANK	No thanks. what does that mean?
JEFFREY	I don't want to go.
FRANK	Go where?
JEFFREY	On a ride.
FRANK	A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.

JEFFREY	Heineken.
FRANK	FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

FRANK	Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
JEFFREY	Here's to Ben.
FRANK	Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.

FRANK	Hey? . You like to walk.
JEFFREY	What?
FRANK	Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 

FRANK	What are you lookin' at?
JEFFREY	Nothing.
FRANK	Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.

FRANK	Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
JEFFREY	Yes.
FRANK	I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

FRANK	Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
RAYMOND	Okay Frank.
FRANK	What kinda beer do you like?

FRANK	Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
RAYMOND	Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
FRANK	No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
RAYMOND	There ya go.
FRANK	Good, let's drink up.

JEFFREY	Yeah, how did you know?
SANDY	I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

JEFFREY	Oh yeah?
SANDY	You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
JEFFREY	Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
SANDY	Am I bothering you?
JEFFREY	No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
SANDY	Yes.
JEFFREY	How is Central these days?
SANDY	Terrible. boring.
JEFFREY	What else is new?. right?
SANDY	Yeah. What are you doing now?
JEFFREY	I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
SANDY	That's too bad.
JEFFREY	What do you know about the ear?. anything?
SANDY	Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
JEFFREY	Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
SANDY	I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
JEFFREY	Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
SANDY	There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
JEFFREY	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
SANDY	No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
JEFFREY	The ear is from a missing person maybe?
SANDY	Maybe so.
JEFFREY	It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
SANDY	Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
JEFFREY	I guess you have to get back home soon?
SANDY	Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.

SANDY	That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
JEFFREY	Where are they?
SANDY	I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

JEFFREY	Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
SANDY	I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
JEFFREY	Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
SANDY	My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
JEFFREY	You really do hear a lot, don't you?
SANDY	Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
JEFFREY	I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
SANDY	Still, it must be kinda rough.
JEFFREY	It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.

SANDY	What happened to him?
JEFFREY	I don't know. he moved away.

SANDY	I've gotta go in.
JEFFREY	Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

SANDY	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
JEFFREY	Yeah. Good bye.

JEFFREY	You hungry or thirsty, or both?
SANDY	I don't know.
JEFFREY	I'd like to talk to you about something.
SANDY	Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.

JEFFREY	I don't want to cause any trouble.
SANDY	I'm here, aren't I?
JEFFREY	I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
SANDY	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

SANDY	Alright, now tell me. What is it?
JEFFREY	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
SANDY	You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
JEFFREY	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
SANDY	It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
JEFFREY	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
SANDY	Now, how are you going to do that?
JEFFREY	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
SANDY	What will I say when she comes to the door?
JEFFREY	You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
SANDY	I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
JEFFREY	Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
SANDY	You've got a point there.

JEFFREY	Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
SANDY	Alright.
JEFFREY	Let's go.

JEFFREY	Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
SANDY	Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
JEFFREY	Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
SANDY	Alright. Good luck, yourself.

SANDY	Are you alright?
JEFFREY	Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?

SANDY	I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
JEFFREY	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
SANDY	No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
JEFFREY	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
SANDY	Yeah, if it opens the door.
JEFFREY	Yeah.

SANDY	So. what's next?
JEFFREY	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
SANDY	I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
JEFFREY	You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
SANDY	Yes. I do.
JEFFREY	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.

SANDY	You really want to do this, don't you?
JEFFREY	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

SANDY	I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
JEFFREY	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
SANDY	I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
JEFFREY	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
SANDY	Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
JEFFREY	Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

SANDY	What's the plan.
JEFFREY	First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
SANDY	Brilliant.
JEFFREY	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
SANDY	This is not my usual Friday night!

JEFFREY	I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
SANDY	That sounds good.
JEFFREY	Two.

JEFFREY	Here's to. an interesting experience.
SANDY	I'll drink to that.

SANDY	Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
JEFFREY	Why not?
SANDY	It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
JEFFREY	It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
SANDY	Yeah. but.
JEFFREY	Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
SANDY	O.K.
JEFFREY	Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
SANDY	. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
JEFFREY	I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
SANDY	I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
JEFFREY	Oh, okay. can I call?
SANDY	Okay. yeah, call.
JEFFREY	Look. it can wait till Sunday.
SANDY	Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
JEFFREY	Yeah.
SANDY	I'm going to wait here until she comes.
JEFFREY	Are you sure?
SANDY	I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?

JEFFREY	Okay. thanks.
SANDY	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
JEFFREY	That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
SANDY	Okay, okay. Bye.

SANDY	Well, how did it go?. What happened?
JEFFREY	Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
SANDY	What did you see?
JEFFREY	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?

JEFFREY	What's with Mike?
SANDY	He got a little jealous.
JEFFREY	I'm sorry, I didn't.
SANDY	It's okay. Don't worry about it.

SANDY	You want a Dairy Queen?
JEFFREY	No way. I'm about to blow up.

SANDY	You want to tell me about it?
JEFFREY	. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
SANDY	Wow. Should you tell my father?
JEFFREY	I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
SANDY	You saw a lot in one night.
JEFFREY	. Actually. I've been in twice.
SANDY	Twice. without her sensing anything?
JEFFREY	Yes.
SANDY	Did you see her undressed?
JEFFREY	Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
SANDY	Yeah?
JEFFREY	That doesn't bother you, does it?
SANDY	Who, me? Why should it?
JEFFREY	That's what I thought.
SANDY	You're sure right. It is a strange world.
JEFFREY	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?

SANDY	I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
JEFFREY	Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
SANDY	So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
JEFFREY	I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.

SANDY	No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?

SANDY	Okay. be careful.
JEFFREY	Okay, Sandy.

JEFFREY	Can I give you a kiss good night?
SANDY	You better not, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	Okay. okay.
SANDY	Goodnight.
JEFFREY	See ya tomorrow.

SANDY	You were late.
JEFFREY	I'm really sorry.
SANDY	What am I going to do?
JEFFREY	You want to go talk to him?
SANDY	Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

SANDY	You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
JEFFREY	That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
SANDY	Shoot.
JEFFREY	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
SANDY	Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.

JEFFREY	Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
SANDY	Oh yeah?
JEFFREY	Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
SANDY	Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY	Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
SANDY	I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
JEFFREY	Yeah.
SANDY	Jeffrey?. Why?
JEFFREY	I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
SANDY	You like mysteries that much?
JEFFREY	Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.

JEFFREY	You worry about me really?
SANDY	Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

JEFFREY	Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
SANDY	Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.

SANDY	Everything okay?
JEFFREY	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
SANDY	You didn't tell him about me?
JEFFREY	No.

SANDY	I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
JEFFREY	Okay. great!

JEFFREY	Okay.
SANDY	What is it?
JEFFREY	Just some fatherly advice.

SANDY	What was that all about?
JEFFREY	Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
SANDY	It's good to see you.
JEFFREY	Where to?
SANDY	Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
JEFFREY	I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
SANDY	It's okay.
JEFFREY	... You look beautiful.
SANDY	Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
JEFFREY	I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

SANDY	You want to dance?
JEFFREY	I can't dance fast.
SANDY	Really?
JEFFREY	Really. you want to dance with someone else?
SANDY	NO.
JEFFREY	Let's wait for some slow one.
SANDY	Just a minute.

JEFFREY	You want to dance?
SANDY	Okay.

SANDY	Oh my God. What's wrong?
JEFFREY	Frank!!

JEFFREY	My father has a gun at home.
SANDY	No.
JEFFREY	Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.

JEFFREY	Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
SANDY	Dorothy Vallens?
JEFFREY	Yes.

SANDY	Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
JEFFREY	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
SANDY	Probably not. no. Why?
JEFFREY	OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
SANDY	Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

JEFFREY	I should go with her, Sandy.
SANDY	Go ahead.
JEFFREY	... Sandy?.
SANDY	Go ahead!

JEFFREY	Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
SANDY	No Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY	Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.

SANDY	Look Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

JEFFREY	Hi Dad.
MR. BEAUMONT	Hey Jeff.

JEFFREY	Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
MR. BEAUMONT	uh uh.
JEFFREY	Are you feeling okay?
MR. BEAUMONT	uh uh.

MR. BEAUMONT	Good to see you, son.
JEFFREY	It's good to see you, Dad.

JEFFREY	How ya doin' Dad?
MR. BEAUMONT	Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
JEFFREY	Good deal Dad.

MRS. BEAUMONT	I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.

MRS. BEAUMONT	Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
JEFFREY	This is it.

MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
JEFFREY	Be right down.

JEFFREY	What time are visiting hours?
MRS. BEAUMONT	I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
JEFFREY	Well. Okay.
MRS. BEAUMONT	Jeffrey, when you see your father.
JEFFREY	Yeah?
MRS. BEAUMONT	He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
JEFFREY	What?
MRS. BEAUMONT	It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
JEFFREY	Thanks a lot, Mom.
MRS. BEAUMONT	.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

JEFFREY	I'm going out for awhile.
MRS. BEAUMONT	Do you want the car?
JEFFREY	No, I'm just gonna walk around.
MRS. BEAUMONT	Alright.

JEFFREY	Can I use the car tonight?
MRS. BEAUMONT	Of course, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY	God. you scared me.
MRS. BEAUMONT	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
JEFFREY	Nothing. I'm fine.
MRS. BEAUMONT	You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

JEFFREY	No.
MIKE	Looks like you'd make a good runner.
JEFFREY	Well.
MIKE	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.

JEFFREY	No. you're right.
MIKE	I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
JEFFREY	Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
MIKE	Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

MIKE	Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
JEFFREY	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

JEFFREY	Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
MRS. WILLIAMS	Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?

JEFFREY	I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
MRS. WILLIAMS	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
JEFFREY	Alright.

MRS. WILLIAMS	I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
JEFFREY	Yeah, I know.
MRS. WILLIAMS	Would you like a piece of cake?
JEFFREY	No. No thank you.
MRS. WILLIAMS	It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
JEFFREY	Yeah. okay.

MRS. WILLIAMS	He comes over to study.
JEFFREY	Yeah.

JEFFREY	Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
MRS. WILLIAMS	Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	Say "goodnight" to Sandy.

MRS. WILLIAMS	Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
JEFFREY	That sounds great!
MRS. WILLIAMS	Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.

MRS. WILLIAMS	Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
JEFFREY	Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
MRS. WILLIAMS	Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

JEFFREY	Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
MRS. WILLIAMS	I'll get a coat for her.

SANDY	Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
MIKE	Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.

MIKE	What are watchin' this junk for?
SANDY	You can change it if you want to.
MIKE	I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
SANDY	Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.

MIKE	Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
SANDY	Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.

MIKE	Come on out a minute, okay?
SANDY	Okay.

MIKE	Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
SANDY	... Stop it Mike.

AMILYN	I don't think this is gold.
LOTHOS	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.

LOTHOS	What's wrong with you!?!
AMILYN	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
LOTHOS	Shut up!  You let him have it!

LOTHOS	You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
AMILYN	I had him in my grasp.
LOTHOS	Cheer up.  You may still.

AMILYN	I look horrible.
LOTHOS	The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
AMILYN	I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
LOTHOS	No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.

ANDY	I like it.  Can I be your friend?
JEFFREY	Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'

JEFFREY	Well, um... litter?
ANDY	Litter, yeah!

ANDY	... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
JEFFREY	I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
ANDY	Coach knows what abs are?

ANDY	Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
JEFFREY	What's with you?

JEFFREY	Nice to feel needed.
ANDY	Let's move out!
JEFFREY	Yes!

BUFFY	Nice game.
ANDY	Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
BUFFY	Andy!

ANDY	Man has a complex.
BUFFY	He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.

BUFFY	Don't grab me, okay?
ANDY	Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.

ANDY	Buffy!  Looking tasty.
BUFFY	Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

ANDY	Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
BUFFY	Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.

PIKE	Booo!
BENNY	Suck!
PIKE	Wrong answer!  No prize.

PIKE	No, we didn't.
BENNY	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.

PIKE	Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
BENNY	That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
PIKE	We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...

PIKE	It's coffee.
BENNY	Amazing!

BENNY	Figures.
PIKE	Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

BENNY	You're the guys from the movie!
PIKE	We hate you guys!

BENNY	Hey!  She wasted my dog!
PIKE	Bummer metaphor.

BENNY	Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
PIKE	You didn't like them.
BENNY	They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
PIKE	Would you sleep with them?
BENNY	Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
PIKE	Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
BENNY	I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
PIKE	Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.

BENNY	When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
PIKE	You think?  Split?
BENNY	Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
PIKE	Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.

PIKE	Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
BENNY	Let me in.
PIKE	Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --

BENNY	Invite me in, Pike.
PIKE	Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
BENNY	I'm fine.
PIKE	You look like shit, Benny.

BENNY	I... feel.... pretty.
PIKE	No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
BENNY	The sun!  It burns!  It burns!

BENNY	Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
PIKE	Get away from here.
BENNY	I'm hungry.
PIKE	I mean it.

MERRICK	Did you see a girl come by here?
BIKER	You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
MERRICK	Yes.
BIKER	Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
MERRICK	Wheels?
BIKER	My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
MERRICK	Which way did she go?
BIKER	Down there.

JENNIFER	Excellent.
BUFFY	What's playing there?

JENNIFER	Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
BUFFY	Yeah, I guess.
JENNIFER	My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.

JENNIFER	Oh, my God.  Is that true?
BUFFY	Probably.  What movie is this?

JENNIFER	Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
BUFFY	Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

JENNIFER	Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
BUFFY	Don't tread on the earth?

BUFFY	Dying.
JENNIFER	Eeyuu.

JENNIFER	Hi, Buffy.
BUFFY	Hi, guys.

JENNIFER	He doesn't look fifty.
BUFFY	Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.

BUFFY'S MOM	Do you know what time it is?
BUFFY	Uum... around ten?

BUFFY'S MOM	Buffy, honey?
BUFFY	Yeah?
BUFFY'S MOM	Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
BUFFY	Maybe.
BUFFY'S MOM	What's Bobby gonna say?
BUFFY	I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
BUFFY'S MOM	Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.

JEFFREY	You okay?
BUFFY	I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

BUFFY	Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
JEFFREY	Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
BUFFY	Something like that.
JEFFREY	Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

BUFFY	What show is this?
JEFFREY	It's the news, Buffy.
BUFFY	Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
JEFFREY	I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
BUFFY	Mmmnkay.

BUFFY	Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
JEFFREY	You were having a nightmare.

JEFFREY	What'd you dream about?
BUFFY	Nothing.
JEFFREY	Come on, what was it?
BUFFY	Nothing.  It was just a dream.

JEFFREY	Hey there.
BUFFY	Hi.

JEFFREY	Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
BUFFY	Jealous?

JEFFREY	Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
BUFFY	I do?  I guess I do.
JEFFREY	Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
BUFFY	I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.

JEFFREY	I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
BUFFY	'Bye.

BUFFY	I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	So I noticed.

JEFFREY	So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
BUFFY	Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.

JEFFREY	Buffy, what are you doing here?
BUFFY	I thought we were meeting here.
JEFFREY	I'm here with Jenny.

BUFFY	I don't understand.
JEFFREY	Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
BUFFY	No, you didn't.  When?
JEFFREY	Didn't you get my message?
BUFFY	You broke up with my machine?
JEFFREY	You weren't home.  Like always.
BUFFY	You left me a message?
JEFFREY	I'm out of here.  Jenny.

LOTHOS	Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
BUFFY	Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
LOTHOS	What?

LOTHOS	You're even weaker than the others.
BUFFY	I think you've forgotten something.

LOTHOS	This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
BUFFY	No...

LOTHOS	I am a God!  A God!
BUFFY	I am so sure.

PIKE	Will you guys shut up, please?
BUFFY	It could happen.

PIKE	Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
BUFFY	You guys are thrashed.

PIKE	Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
BUFFY	Buffy.

BUFFY	Hi.
PIKE	Hi there.
BUFFY	Is that your car?
PIKE	It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --

BUFFY	How are you doing?
PIKE	Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
BUFFY	You want some water or something?
PIKE	Water.  Okay.

PIKE	Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
BUFFY	Not exactly.
PIKE	They were vampires, weren't they?
BUFFY	Yeah.
PIKE	God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

BUFFY	You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
PIKE	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
BUFFY	Well, stay here tonight.
PIKE	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
BUFFY	Where are you gonna go?
PIKE	Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

PIKE	Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
BUFFY	It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.

BUFFY	Things are kind of confusing.
PIKE	I'll back that up.
BUFFY	Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
PIKE	I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
BUFFY	It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
PIKE	No, you're not.

BUFFY	I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
PIKE	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
BUFFY	You sure?
PIKE	Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
BUFFY	Mmkay.

PIKE	Hey, Buffy...
BUFFY	Yeah?
PIKE	You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.

BUFFY	I didn't expect to see you.
PIKE	I know.
BUFFY	Why'd you come back?
PIKE	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
BUFFY	Thanks.
PIKE	Besides, Oxnard sucks.

BUFFY	Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
PIKE	I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?

PIKE	Buffy?  What's wrong?
BUFFY	Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
PIKE	Who?
BUFFY	Merrick...

PIKE	I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
BUFFY	I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
PIKE	Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
BUFFY	A dress.
PIKE	Dress, huh?  What for?
BUFFY	For the dance.
PIKE	Come again?
BUFFY	I'm going to the senior dance.
PIKE	Second word... sound like 'dance'.

BUFFY	I'm going to the dance.
PIKE	What for?
BUFFY	In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
PIKE	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
BUFFY	It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
PIKE	You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
BUFFY	I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
PIKE	Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
BUFFY	He did what he was supposed to.
PIKE	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
BUFFY	Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
PIKE	I should have known.

BUFFY	Leave me alone.
PIKE	Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.

PIKE	I crashed your party.
BUFFY	Pretty shallow of you.
PIKE	That's me.
BUFFY	I'm glad you came.
PIKE	Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.

PIKE	Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
BUFFY	I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.

BUFFY	I'm going out the front.
PIKE	Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
BUFFY	You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
PIKE	You say that like it's a bad thing.

BUFFY	Good thing one of us was prepared.
PIKE	Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.

PIKE	Are you okay?
BUFFY	Get away from me!

PIKE	I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
BUFFY	Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
PIKE	Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
BUFFY	We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
PIKE	You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.

BUFFY	It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
CASSANDRA	'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'

CASSANDRA	It is a pretty crucial subject.
BUFFY	See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.

BUFFY	Bugs.
CASSANDRA	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?

CASSANDRA	Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
BUFFY	Bogutude.  Blow it off.
CASSANDRA	I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
BUFFY	You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
CASSANDRA	Like what?
BUFFY	Like my homework.

KIMBERLY	Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
BUFFY	) What do you think?
KIMBERLY	Please.  It's so '91.

KIMBERLY	What are we doing?
BUFFY	Why don't we see a movie?
KIMBERLY	Well, where?

KIMBERLY	Beverly Center.
BUFFY	Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.

KIMBERLY	Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
BUFFY	Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

BUFFY	Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
KIMBERLY	Nice ensemble!

KIMBERLY	What did Jeffrey's dad say?
BUFFY	'Just remember you're in training, son'

KIMBERLY	Let's meet tonight, okay?
BUFFY	Where?
KIMBERLY	Cafe Blase.

KIMBERLY	I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
BUFFY	Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

BUFFY	I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
KIMBERLY	Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
BUFFY	Get a boob job.

KIMBERLY	You were supposed to be here at three.
BUFFY	I forgot.
KIMBERLY	Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
BUFFY	Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
KIMBERLY	Oh my God you're having an affair.

BUFFY	Excuse me for having something important to do.
KIMBERLY	This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
BUFFY	Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.

BUFFY	Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
KIMBERLY	Get out of my facial.

BUFFY	I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
KIMBERLY	Yeah, whoops I came.
BUFFY	You look way pretty, Kim.
KIMBERLY	I know.  I like your little outfit.

BUFFY	God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
MERRICK	I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.

BUFFY	What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
MERRICK	I'm looking for you, actually.
BUFFY	Am I in trouble or something?
MERRICK	Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
BUFFY	What are you talking about?
MERRICK	I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
BUFFY	Why?
MERRICK	To bring you... your birthright.
BUFFY	My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?

BUFFY	I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
MERRICK	You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
BUFFY	Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
MERRICK	Wait!
BUFFY	You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
MERRICK	You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
BUFFY	Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
MERRICK	You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
BUFFY	Time to do what?
MERRICK	To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
BUFFY	Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
MERRICK	Yes.
BUFFY	Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
MERRICK	I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.

BUFFY	Just stay away from me, okay?
MERRICK	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?

BUFFY	Everybody does.
MERRICK	In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.

BUFFY	I was a slave.
MERRICK	In Virginia.
BUFFY	I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
MERRICK	China.
BUFFY	Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.

BUFFY	I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
MERRICK	Lothos.

BUFFY	How do you know all this?
MERRICK	I have to show you.

BUFFY	I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
MERRICK	Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
BUFFY	Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.

BUFFY	Ow.
MERRICK	Cramps?
BUFFY	None of your business.  God.
MERRICK	This is it.

BUFFY	Wait a minute.
MERRICK	Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
BUFFY	All right.  What do we do now?
MERRICK	We wait for Robert to wake up.

MERRICK	Where's the other one?
BUFFY	She --

MERRICK	Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
BUFFY	All right.

MERRICK	Meet me at this address after school.
BUFFY	I have cheerleading squad.
MERRICK	Skip it.

BUFFY	They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
MERRICK	It's true.

MERRICK	It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
BUFFY	Our purposes.

BUFFY	What, um...  What do we do?
MERRICK	There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
BUFFY	Why do you keep saying that?
MERRICK	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
BUFFY	A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
MERRICK	Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
BUFFY	Oh, him.
MERRICK	Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
BUFFY	What?
MERRICK	We'll cover it later.
BUFFY	I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
MERRICK	In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
BUFFY	Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
MERRICK	We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.

BUFFY	Not a pressing issue.
MERRICK	I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
BUFFY	Uh... gym.
MERRICK	Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
BUFFY	Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
MERRICK	But you enjoyed it, yes?
BUFFY	Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
MERRICK	Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
BUFFY	Sporting events, yeah.
MERRICK	All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
BUFFY	Here?
MERRICK	Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
BUFFY	Okay.

BUFFY	Who we gonna beat?
MERRICK	Who we gonna beat?
BUFFY	No -- you don't have to --
MERRICK	Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
BUFFY	No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
MERRICK	Oh.  Good.

BUFFY	Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK	I had to test you.
BUFFY	But you threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK	And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
BUFFY	I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!

MERRICK	It was necessary.
BUFFY	Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
MERRICK	I don't think you understand the full implications of --

BUFFY	Oh.  Sorry.
MERRICK	Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
BUFFY	Put your head back.
MERRICK	Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
BUFFY	No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
MERRICK	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.

BUFFY	Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
MERRICK	Your turn.

BUFFY	What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
MERRICK	No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
BUFFY	Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
MERRICK	Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
BUFFY	If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
MERRICK	Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
BUFFY	My nails.

MERRICK	All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
BUFFY	They were vampires?
MERRICK	Same one.
BUFFY	Oh.

BUFFY	What!?!
MERRICK	Try to pay attention.

MERRICK	He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
BUFFY	Fine.
MERRICK	And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
BUFFY	Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
MERRICK	You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.

BUFFY	Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
MERRICK	It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
BUFFY	Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
MERRICK	You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
BUFFY	You are such a wet.
MERRICK	A what?
BUFFY	A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
MERRICK	Don't start with me again.
BUFFY	Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
MERRICK	Buffy...
BUFFY	And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
MERRICK	What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
BUFFY	Oh, fuck you!

MERRICK	Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
BUFFY	I...
MERRICK	What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?

BUFFY	Five?
MERRICK	Five.
BUFFY	So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
MERRICK	Not if you're careful.
BUFFY	How can you keep doing this?
MERRICK	It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
BUFFY	Watchers?
MERRICK	There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
BUFFY	I wish you would.
MERRICK	It isn't important.
BUFFY	I'm curious, is all.
MERRICK	Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
BUFFY	And it makes it worse when I die, right?

BUFFY	Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
MERRICK	As for example, what?
BUFFY	Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
MERRICK	Vampires of the world, beware.
BUFFY	Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.

BUFFY	I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
MERRICK	I can't work this.
BUFFY	We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
MERRICK	But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
BUFFY	Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
MERRICK	My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
BUFFY	Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.

MERRICK	I want to die.
BUFFY	Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.

MERRICK	Interesting.
BUFFY	I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.

MERRICK	There isn't time.
BUFFY	Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
MERRICK	Another distraction.  It's not right.
BUFFY	Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
MERRICK	Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
BUFFY	I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
MERRICK	All right.
BUFFY	Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
MERRICK	Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
BUFFY	Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
MERRICK	Football is my life.
BUFFY	You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.

MERRICK	None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
BUFFY	And where are they now?

MERRICK	Wait!
BUFFY	He knows who I am!

BUFFY	Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
NICOLE	You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
BUFFY	Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!

BUFFY	No THX.
NICOLE	They don't even have Dolby.

NICOLE	So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
BUFFY	That's the plan.
NICOLE	Good enough!

NICOLE	Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
BUFFY	Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

NICOLE	Come one, that was so weird.
BUFFY	What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.

NICOLE	-- like she's gonna kill me.
BUFFY	I was just scared is all.
NICOLE	No.  It was mondo bizarro.

BUFFY	That is so cool.
NICOLE	Thank you very much.
BUFFY	Nobody is even gonna look at the game.

NICOLE	I don't get it.
BUFFY	How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.

BUFFY	You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
NICOLE	Cassandra's really smart.
BUFFY	Yeah... She's okay, though.
NICOLE	I guess.

BUFFY	Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
NICOLE	Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
BUFFY	B'bye.

NICOLE	Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
BUFFY	Thanks.
NICOLE	You and Cassandra get anything done last night?

NICOLE	Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
BUFFY	Sorry.

BUFFY	Pike.
NICOLE	You're having a fling with him?

NICOLE	Well, I guess you got what you came for.
BUFFY	Nicole...
NICOLE	Later for it.

BUFFY	Hi, guys.
NICOLE	Hi.
BUFFY	Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.

NICOLE	I haven't seen him tonight.
BUFFY	Oh.

LOTHOS	I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
CASSANDRA	What's happening?  What do you want?
LOTHOS	So very much.
CASSANDRA	My parents have money...
LOTHOS	Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.

CASSANDRA	What... are you?
LOTHOS	Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.

CASSANDRA	No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
LOTHOS	Really?
CASSANDRA	Swear to God.

GIRL	I can't!
MAN	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
GIRL	Why?  Why me?
MAN	She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.

MAN	The mark of the Coven.
GIRL	I don't understand.
MAN	Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.

MAN	But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
GIRL	I'm just a girl.
MAN	You are much more.

GRUELLER	Bessel!  What are you doing here?
WALLY	Hi, Grueller.
GRUELLER	What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
WALLY	Could be.
GRUELLER	You think so?
WALLY	Could be.

GRUELLER	Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
WALLY	Got that.
GRUELLER	Good.

JEFFREY	Write that down.
JENNIFER	Okay, what else?

JENNIFER	Oh, yes!  Yes!
JEFFREY	Oh, baby!
JENNIFER	Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!

JEFFREY	Buffy?
JENNIFER	Jeffrey!

JEFFREY	Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
JENNIFER	No --
JEFFREY	Okay, let's go.
JENNIFER	But --

JENNIFER	She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
JEFFREY	I heard she got straight A's.

KIMBERLY	I can't believe they still ate it.
JENNIFER	Where'd you learn how to do that?

JENNIFER	So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
KIMBERLY	Well, I hope so.
JENNIFER	Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.

JENNIFER	I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
KIMBERLY	Throw it out.

JENNIFER	And Spring Fling.
KIMBERLY	Okay.

JENNIFER	She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
KIMBERLY	Buffy?

JENNIFER	Omniplex?
NICOLE	Nee sitch.  No way.

JENNIFER	What happened?
NICOLE	Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
JENNIFER	You're kidding.
NICOLE	Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
JENNIFER	Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
NICOLE	Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --

JENNIFER	I never thought of that.
NICOLE	I gotta bail.  You coming?

NICOLE	Buffy!
JENNIFER	What is she...

NICOLE	Cool!
JENNIFER	Does Jeffrey know?

PIKE	The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
KIMBERLY	Wit-tay.
PIKE	I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
KIMBERLY	Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
PIKE	Hey, wait a minute...

KIMBERLY	They'll kill us!
PIKE	You want some punch?

NICOLE	Oh, God.
KIMBERLY	He is so bald.

NICOLE	God!  Take a chill lozenge.
KIMBERLY	Like we don't have rights too?

NICOLE	The homelesses?
KIMBERLY	Oh, please.

NICOLE	Environment.  That's cool with me.
KIMBERLY	Okay.

KIMBERLY	Oh, yeah!
NICOLE	Right!

NICOLE	If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
KIMBERLY	Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
NICOLE	Well, look who's here.

KIMBERLY	Smell of booze much.
NICOLE	Nice much.

KIMBERLY	Buffy, the ape-woman.
NICOLE	Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?

NICOLE	I really was way way too too.
KIMBERLY	Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
NICOLE	I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

NICOLE	What are you talking about?
KIMBERLY	Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.

KIMBERLY	Oh, thank you very much.
NICOLE	Like you've got a grip.
KIMBERLY	You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --

NICOLE	So, we're stupid now?
KIMBERLY	You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
NICOLE	Except for Prom.
KIMBERLY	Right.

NICOLE	And the January Semi-formal --
KIMBERLY	Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.

NICOLE	It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
KIMBERLY	As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?

ZEPH	What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
PIKE	I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
ZEPH	Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
PIKE	Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
ZEPH	No...  You want me to give him a message?
PIKE	You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.

ZEPH	Ah, you'll be coming back.
PIKE	I don't think so.
ZEPH	All right.  Take care of yourself.
PIKE	I am.
ZEPH	Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
PIKE	Run.

CAPTAIN GOD	Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
ADONIS	Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..

ADONIS	The crowd bought it.
CAPTAIN GOD	Crowd always buys it. What do we got?

CAPTAIN GOD	Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
ADONIS	I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
CAPTAIN GOD	You have to dial nine first.

ADONIS	Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
CAPTAIN GOD	It's okay. Let her go.

CAPTAIN GOD	Have we reached the epi-center?
ADONIS	Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...

CAPTAIN GOD	Works for me.
ADONIS	I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.

CAPTAIN GOD	I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
ADONIS	Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
CAPTAIN GOD	Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.

ADONIS	Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
CACTUS	Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...

ADONIS	I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
CACTUS	This looks promising...

ADONIS	Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
CACTUS	Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.

CACTUS	That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

ADONIS	You know, nobody likes you...
CACTUS	Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..

BROCK	He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
SELINA	In women?
BROCK	No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
SELINA	I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
BROCK	You say that like an amnesia victim.
SELINA	Guilty. I am.
BROCK	Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
SELINA	I don't know. I can't remember.

BROCK	Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
SELINA	I wonder..

BROCK	What's the matter...
SELINA	Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
BROCK	I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
SELINA	You're probably right.
BROCK	I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?

SELINA	How heroic of you...
BROCK	Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
SELINA	But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
BROCK	There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
SELINA	I'm not afraid. Are you?

SELINA	You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
BROCK	What did you think?
SELINA	Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
BROCK	Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
SELINA	I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
BROCK	You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..

BROCK	I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
SELINA	Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
BROCK	So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.

SELINA	I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
BROCK	What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
SELINA	No it's not.

SELINA	A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
BROCK	What's the matter?  What are you saying?
SELINA	Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.

BROCK	This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
SELINA	Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
BROCK	Are you sure?
SELINA	I'm sure.

BROCK	Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
SELINA	I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
BROCK	Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
SELINA	At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
BROCK	Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
SELINA	Uh Brock, today you are without me...

SELINA	Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
BROCK	What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...

SELINA	Hmm. Not bad.
BROCK	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..

SELINA	No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
BROCK	I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..

BROCK	Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
SELINA	A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.

SELINA	Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
BROCK	Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..

BROCK	This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
SELINA	It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
BROCK	You're serious?  You'd help me...

SELINA	In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
BROCK	We'll hunt him down together...

SELINA	I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
BROCK	I lied.

LANE	There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
BROCK	Oh, how long have you had your own route?
LANE	Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..

LANE	Women, huh?
BROCK	They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
LANE	Selina Kyle...lovely person.
BROCK	She has a real spirit.
LANE	A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
BROCK	She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
LANE	I suppose she does.

LANE	I better go report this in...
BROCK	Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...

LANE	Selina, are you okay?
BROCK	Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?

BROCK	You're kidding.
LANE	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.

BROCK	You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
LANE	Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..

LANE	We're waiting.
BROCK	Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
LANE	Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?

LANE	I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
BROCK	It may be time to get the police involved...

LANE	I've been looking for you.
BROCK	I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
LANE	But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
BROCK	I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
LANE	What little boy doesn't?

BROCK	You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
CACTUS	Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
BROCK	Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?

BROCK	Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
CACTUS	Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
BROCK	Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!

CACTUS	God, can you hear me!
BROCK	Wha-at?
CACTUS	Catwomen. Lots of them!
BROCK	Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?

BROCK	I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
CATWOMAN	Winning.
BROCK	What do you want from me?
CATWOMAN	At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
BROCK	My dog!

CATWOMAN	Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
BROCK	I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
CATWOMAN	Pass!
BROCK	You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
CATWOMAN	I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..

BROCK	Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
CATWOMAN	You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
BROCK	Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?

BROCK	Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
CATWOMAN	Even the skylight?
BROCK	The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
CATWOMAN	What about "climbing in?"

SPOOKY	The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
CACTUS	I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?

CACTUS	Dat's gotta hurt!
SPOOKY	He didn't remember to roll up his window...

SPOOKY	What's the catch?
CACTUS	Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...

SPOOKY	Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
CACTUS	Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.

CACTUS	Yeah, this is better than rape.
SPOOKY	Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
CACTUS	Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...

CACTUS	What a "drag."
CAPTAIN GOD	Well done, Cactus.

CAPTAIN GOD	Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
CACTUS	That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
CAPTAIN GOD	Well. I stand corrected.

CACTUS	Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
CAPTAIN GOD	I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...

CACTUS	Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
CAPTAIN GOD	Why am I still troubled...

CACTUS	I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
CAPTAIN GOD	How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.

CACTUS	God-damn..
CAPTAIN GOD	What did you say?
CACTUS	Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
CAPTAIN GOD	I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...

CACTUS	Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
CAPTAIN GOD	Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.

CAPTAIN GOD	Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
CACTUS	I got her...

CACTUS	Car wash, Captain?
CAPTAIN GOD	Absolutely.

CACTUS	My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
CAPTAIN GOD	I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.

SPOOKY	Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
CAPTAIN GOD	Now he'll be up all night...

CAPTAIN GOD	Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
SPOOKY	A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?

CAPTAIN GOD	Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
SPOOKY	Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.

SPOOKY	You like them, don't you, Boss.
CAPTAIN GOD	Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.

CAPTAIN GOD	The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
SPOOKY	I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
CAPTAIN GOD	What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!

SPOOKY	I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
CAPTAIN GOD	Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.

SPOOKY	Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
CAPTAIN GOD	Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...

SPOOKY	I loved you.
CAPTAIN GOD	I know.

CATWOMAN	You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
CAPTAIN GOD	And...your point?

CAPTAIN GOD	Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
CATWOMAN	It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
CAPTAIN GOD	A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
CATWOMAN	A superhero's job is to protect.. Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
CAPTAIN GOD	My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
CATWOMAN	Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
CAPTAIN GOD	Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
CATWOMAN	I still have one left...
CAPTAIN GOD	You think so?...Selina?
CATWOMAN	You've seen me...

CATWOMAN	How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
CAPTAIN GOD	I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.

CATWOMAN	I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
CAPTAIN GOD	Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.

CAPTAIN GOD	Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
CATWOMAN	You can't get away with..

CATWOMAN	Spooky.
SPOOKY	Spear.

CATWOMAN	Hello, Spooky.
SPOOKY	I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
CATWOMAN	Whatever you say...Sis.

SPOOKY	Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
CATWOMAN	You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..

CATWOMAN	I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
SPOOKY	Men, huh?

SPOOKY	For when the time comes..
CATWOMAN	For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
SPOOKY	And I...I..want you to know our secrets..

CATWOMAN	Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
SPOOKY	The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
CATWOMAN	Save the City? I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
SPOOKY	You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
CATWOMAN	Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.

FEMALE EXEC CAT	You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
HOUSECAT	You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
FEMALE EXEC CAT	Did you just say "girls?"

FEMALE EXEC CAT	I'm a good mother!
HOUSECAT	You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
FEMALE EXEC CAT	How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
HOUSECAT	What's the name of your child's best friend?
FEMALE EXEC CAT	Ask me another one--

FRANK	You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
SELINA	What's the good news?

FRANK	You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
SELINA	Pre-bicentennial babe?
FRANK	Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...

FRANK	There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
SELINA	Stop.
FRANK	Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
SELINA	Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.

FRANK	Hey, you're anti-male.
SELINA	Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
FRANK	What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
SELINA	What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
FRANK	Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..

LANE	A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
SELINA	Uh. "Thanks?"

SELINA	I don't know what came over me.
LANE	What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
SELINA	Yeah, she's okay.
LANE	Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..

LANE	Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
SELINA	I actually got some memory back last night.
LANE	How much?
SELINA	Enough.
LANE	Oh now this one is mine...

LANE	Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
SELINA	But of course you are.
LANE	I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
SELINA	I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
LANE	Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..

LANE	Good morning.
SELINA	Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
LANE	No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
SELINA	Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...

SELINA	Next time, call...
LANE	I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?

SELINA	Hey, Captain God!
LANE	What did--?
SELINA	You turned around!
LANE	Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
SELINA	Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
LANE	Actually, yes.

SELINA	Did you try to kill...
LANE	What?
SELINA	Nothing. How's your hand?
LANE	About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
SELINA	Like you don't know...
LANE	I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
SELINA	I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
LANE	I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
SELINA	Hey, I thought...

LANE	I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
SELINA	Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
LANE	You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.

SELINA	I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
LANE	You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
SELINA	You are...
LANE	Uh-huh..

LANE	Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
SELINA	I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.

LANE	Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
SELINA	Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."

SELINA	Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
LANE	Not too cool...
SELINA	Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.

SELINA	You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
LANE	Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.

SELINA	Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
LANE	We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
SELINA	I'll let you know.

LIBRARY CLERK	I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
SELINA	But I'm blind.
LIBRARY CLERK	It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
SELINA	What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
LIBRARY CLERK	Okay, deal.
SELINA	I'll go out with you. Now go get me these old newspapers...

MOM	You're late.
SELINA	Yes, Mother. Dear.

SELINA	A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
MOM	Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
SELINA	Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
MOM	Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
SELINA	Maybe.
MOM	It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
SELINA	Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..

SELINA	I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
MOM	Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.

MOM	Don't sneak up on me...
SELINA	Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
MOM	Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.

MOM	Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
SELINA	It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.

SELINA	Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
MOM	What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
SELINA	I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
MOM	Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.

SELINA	They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
MOM	I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
SELINA	Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
MOM	Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
SELINA	But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
MOM	Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
SELINA	I don't know if I can do it alone.
MOM	Trust me, you won't have to.

SELINA	What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
SPOOKY	I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
SELINA	Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..

SELINA	What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
SPOOKY	We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...

SELINA	You seem sad, Spooky.
SPOOKY	I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
SELINA	The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?

SPOOKY	You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
SELINA	You going to talk all day?

SELINA	Nice breasts.
SPOOKY	Thanks.

ARLO	What, do you work for my boss, dog?
ARLO	Okay, okay.
ARLO	At least somebody likes this shit.

ARLO	Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
ARLO	Where do you want this stuff?
MASON	Freezer in the back.
ARLO	Great. 
MASON	Art.

MASON	That's my business.
ARLO	No argument there.
MASON	The guy's a fuckin' moron.
ARLO	Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
MASON	Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
ARLO	Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
MASON	Since when does...
MASON	...Darlene pay you in cash?
ARLO	Since today.  New policy.
MASON	Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
ARLO	Well, he told me to collect cash.
MASON	Andy.  Another fuckin'...
MASON	...moron.
ARLO	Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
ARLO	Uh, huh?
ARLO	Except for the fact that I need cash.
MASON	He could've called first.
ARLO	He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
ARLO	...and fair...
ARLO	...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
ARLO	Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
ARLO	...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
ARLO	...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
ARLO	That'll make up the difference, huh?
ARLO	Huh?
MASON	Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
ARLO	Oh.

ARLO	Aw!  Oh, Jesus.

ARLO	Sorry, man.  He's dead.
MASON	 No.

ARLO	What did I say?
ARLO	Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
MASON	I need your truck.
ARLO	No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
ARLO	...and a shitload of ice.
MASON	Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
MASON	...-tana.
ARLO	Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
ARLO	...ya?
MASON	Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
ARLO	For cryin' out loud.
ARLO	Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
ARLO	...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
ARLO	...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
MASON	I need your help.
ARLO	You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
ARLO	...truck.
MASON	Then you drive me to McGrud-...
MASON	...-er.
ARLO	Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
ARLO	And if that Elvis shit...
ARLO	...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
ARLO	Peace.
MASON	All right.
MASON	Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
MASON	You want cash?
MASON	You want cash?
MASON	I got, like, uh....
MASON	I got, uh....
MASON	I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
MASON	I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
ARLO	No.
MASON	All right, then how about this?
ARLO	Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
ARLO	...doing?!
MASON	I need your truck!
ARLO	You are not takin' my truck!

MASON	Go on.
ARLO	Would you hurry up, please?
MASON	Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
MASON	There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
ARLO	What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
MASON	You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
ARLO	Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
MASON	What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
ARLO	That dog was mean before I met him.
MASON	That dog ain't mean.
ARLO	I'm gonna stomp your a--
MASON	Come on, get in the truck.
ARLO	I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
MASON	Shut...

MASON	...up.
ARLO	Are you kiddin'?

MASON	We're clear.
ARLO	Oh, man.

MASON	No cell.
ARLO	Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.

MASON	Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
ARLO	No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
ARLO	...-er.
MASON	No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
ARLO	No, no, no.
ARLO	To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
MASON	No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
MASON	...-er.
ARLO	I ain't goin' through Missoula!
MASON	Am I missing somethin' here?
ARLO	Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
MASON	Borrowed.
ARLO	Yeah, borrowed!
MASON	You stole this truck.
MASON	You stole this truck!
ARLO	I did not steal this truck!
MASON	You stole this truck! That's...
MASON	...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
MASON	...the ice cream for money!
ARLO	I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
MASON	Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.

ARLO	I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
MASON	That's...
MASON	...fine.
ARLO	I ain't playin' that.
MASON	 Shut up.

ARLO	Hey.
ARLO	We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
MASON	Fine. 

ARLO	 
MASON	God-...
MASON	...-damn!
ARLO	Okay, okay! 
MASON	Ah, one of them's in the back.
MASON	No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
ARLO	Okay. 



ARLO	You're nuts, goin' back there!
MASON	Shut up.
ARLO	Take your gun!
MASON	Doesn't work.
ARLO	What?
MASON	Doesn't...
MASON	...work!  It's not even load-...
MASON	...-ed.
ARLO	You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!

ARLO	Oh, shit.
ARLO	Oh...

ARLO	Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
MASON	All right.
ARLO	Okay!  All right!

MASON	    Elvis is on ice again.
ARLO	Okay.
MASON	 Nice job back there.
ARLO	Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
ARLO	...gun?!
MASON	I was thankin' you, asshole!
ARLO	Kiss my ass!

ARLO	Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
MASON	 No...
MASON	...I'm not the psycho.
ARLO	Hey, take a look at your situation and...
ARLO	...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
ARLO	...-cho and a hijack-...
ARLO	...-er!
MASON	Hi--!  The gun was empty!
ARLO	Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
ARLO	...you.
MASON	You wanna hit me?
ARLO	And I'm a peaceful man, and...
ARLO	...I believe in live and...
MASON	 Yeah...
ARLO	...let live.
MASON	...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
ARLO	I did not steal the truck.
MASON	 
ARLO	It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
ARLO	...truck!
MASON	Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
ARLO	Well, then, that means it's call...
ARLO	...waiting!
MASON	You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
ARLO	Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.

ARLO	...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
ARLO	...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
MASON	All right, you got it.

MASON	Fuck! 
MASON	Oh, shit.
ARLO	  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
ARLO	...Shift.
ARLO	You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
MASON	I think...
MASON	...we can make it.
ARLO	You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
ARLO	Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
ARLO	Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
ARLO	Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
MASON	I don't think we have much of a choice...
MASON	...do we?
ARLO	Oh, shit.
MASON	That's right.  Now,  move!
ARLO	Oh, shit.
ARLO	 Okay.
MASON	Okay. 

MASON	Goddamn!
ARLO	Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.

ARLO	 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
ARLO	Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
MASON	Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
MASON	Oh, shit.
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.
ARLO	Come on!
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.
ARLO	God, man!
ARLO	I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
MASON	 Oh...
MASON	...easy, easy, easy.
MASON	Left, left, left!
MASON	Get over!  Get over!
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
ARLO	...Pete!  Come on.
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
ARLO	I know the likeli-...
ARLO	...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
ARLO	...Night Shift, but you might...
ARLO	...wanna give it a try!
ARLO	Come on, old...
ARLO	...Pete.  Come on.
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Come on...
ARLO	...you crazy bastard.
MASON	All right, you got it, you got it!

MASON	Whoo!
ARLO	Whoo!
MASON	I made it!
MASON	 I made it.
ARLO	What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
MASON	You okay?
ARLO	What the fuck was that?!
MASON	Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
ARLO	Gee, you think so?
ARLO	Holy--!
ARLO	 Okay.  That didn't work.
MASON	 Gee, you think so?
ARLO	Shut up!
MASON	Ho, ho...
ARLO	 Oh...
MASON	...ho!
ARLO	 ...shit!
ARLO	 
MASON	Hang on!
MASON	Hey!

ARLO	 Shit. 
MASON	 Go on.
ARLO	 Go, go.
ARLO	Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
ARLO	No.  Shit.
MASON	Come on.
ARLO	 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
ARLO	Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
ARLO	Okay.
MASON	All right.
MASON	Okay.
ARLO	All right.
MASON	Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
ARLO	 Okay.  Okay. 
MASON	These'll keep it cold.
ARLO	Yeah...
ARLO	...yeah.
MASON	 Aw, shit  
MASON	All right, let's go.
ARLO	Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
MASON	Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.

ARLO	 Listen!  Listen...
ARLO	...to him!  You don't know who...
ARLO	...you're dealin' with!
MASON	I'm a dangerous man!
ARLO	Yeah, he's a dangerous...
ARLO	...man!
ARLO	He's crazy!
MASON	I'm crazy?

MASON	Taking it down the hill.
ARLO	You're--?  What?!
ARLO	You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
MASON	Then stay...
MASON	...here!
ARLO	Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

MASON	I don't want you to come anyway. 
ARLO	What?
MASON	Come on!
ARLO	Oh, shit.



MASON	Keep still.
ARLO	Okay.  Okay.
ARLO	Oh, shit!
MASON	No!
ARLO	Oh, no!
ARLO	Oh, no!

ARLO	 All right.  Hey.
ARLO	Whoo-hoo-hoo!

ARLO	Uh-oh.
MASON	What?
ARLO	This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
MASON	This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
ARLO	Okay.
ARLO	Worth a try.
ARLO	Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
ARLO	...did you?
MASON	You're fucked, man.
ARLO	See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
ARLO	...-tion?
MASON	Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
MASON	...stole the truck.
ARLO	Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
ARLO	...piece of shit was worth.
MASON	It won't even start half the time.
ARLO	You know what I'm sayin'?
ARLO	I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
ARLO	And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
ARLO	...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
ARLO	...or nephew or some good old boy...
ARLO	...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
ARLO	...overdrawn bank accounts.
ARLO	Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
MASON	So you took his...
MASON	...truck.
ARLO	So I took his truck, yeah.
MASON	 Yeah.
ARLO	You know.

MASON	You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
MASON	We were nationally  ranked.
ARLO	How wonderful for you.
MASON	Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
ARLO	Robert Del Rio?
MASON	Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
ARLO	I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
MASON	We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
MASON	And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
MASON	...hospital.
MASON	Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
MASON	Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
MASON	And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
MASON	Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
ARLO	Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
MASON	We got two paddles.

MASON	Listen, Arlo...
MASON	...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
MASON	...shit.
ARLO	To tell you the truth, you didn't.
ARLO	Not completely, anyway.
ARLO	I mean, if that gun was...
ARLO	...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
ARLO	...-er.  It was your friend...
ARLO	...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
ARLO	...shit.
MASON	Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
MASON	...split.
ARLO	Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
ARLO	...miles.
ARLO	Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.

ARLO	That is loud!  I'm 
MASON	 Whoo!
ARLO	Yeah, baby!

ARLO	All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
ARLO	Hey.   Mason.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	I think you oughta cut a...
ARLO	...deal with this asshole.
ARLO	Even though it is nice to see Andy...
ARLO	 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
ARLO	...or my conscience.
ARLO	A-And you  owe me...
ARLO	...man.
MASON	Yeah, I know, I know.

ARLO	 
MASON	Bring him down!

MASON	You all right?

ARLO	Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

MASON	Ow!  
ARLO	Are you all right?
MASON	No. 

MASON	Listen, Arlo.
ARLO	Hey!

ARLO	They're takin' off.
MASON	Huh?
ARLO	They're movin'.

MASON	Hey, just shut up.
ARLO	We're gonna die!
MASON	Arlo, shut up.

ARLO	We're gonna die!
ARLO	We're gonna die!
MASON	Hey, hey, hey.
MASON	Put your hand in my pants.
ARLO	What?
ARLO	We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
MASON	Arlo!  Arlo.
MASON	Reach into my pocket.
MASON	 Come on!
ARLO	Oh.
ARLO	 Okay.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	 Okay.
ARLO	Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
MASON	Okay. 
ARLO	 All right.  Okay.
ARLO	Okay. 
MASON	Arlo!
ARLO	 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 



ARLO	Okay. 
ARLO	Come on, come on!

ARLO	Okay, here we go.
ARLO	Come here.
MASON	Go, go, go! 

ARLO	You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
ARLO	...-natic.
MASON	 That's why I didn't give it...
MASON	...to him. 
ARLO	What?
ARLO	You got Elvis?!
MASON	Sometimes the prey bites back.
MASON	Go!
MASON	Stop.
ARLO	Hang...
ARLO	...on!

MASON	Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
MASON	...-ful?!
ARLO	Okay.  Okay.

MASON	Oh, fuck!
MASON	Forty-five seven!
ARLO	Oh, shit.
MASON	Okay.

ARLO	We!
MASON	  I've got the real thing!
ARLO	We've got Elvis!

ARLO	Here...
ARLO	...they come!
MASON	And Brynner's right on...
MASON	...our ass!
ARLO	He's comin' up fast!

ARLO	Okay...
ARLO	...here comes the...
ARLO	...tunnel!
MASON	Tunnel.

MASON	Whoo!
ARLO	Whoo!

MASON	Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
ARLO	What do you think I'm doin'?!

MASON	What the hell?
ARLO	What the--?
MASON	You've gotta be...

ARLO	Stupid.
MASON	I'm gonna kill him.

ARLO	Unbe-fucking-lievable.
MASON	 

ARLO	Shoot me. 
MASON	 What's it say? 
ARLO	Forty-nine point four.
MASON	 It says forty- nine.

ARLO	Mason.
MASON	What?
ARLO	It's melting, man.



ARLO	All right 

MASON	Oh.
MASON	Come on.  Come on.
ARLO	 

ARLO	What?
MASON	 
ARLO	What?
MASON	It's working.
MASON	We got-...
MASON	...-ta get outta here!
ARLO	 Vitelli! Vitelli!
ARLO	Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

ARLO	Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
MASON	 There's gotta be...
MASON	...another way  outta here.    Hey.
ARLO	Hold this. 
MASON	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ARLO	Sorry.

ARLO	Hang on, hang on.
MASON	Let's go!
ARLO	Go.

ARLO	Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
MASON	Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
MASON	They'll meet you at the top.
ARLO	Okay.  Come on, big guy!

ARLO	Look out.
MASON	What'd you come back for?!
ARLO	Why'd you stay behind?!

MASON	Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

ARLO	 Well.
ARLO	You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
ARLO	We're the shit.  Bigtime.
MASON	They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
ARLO	Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
ARLO	Stop limpin' around like that.
MASON	Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
ARLO	Always the negative...

MASON	You did help a little.
ARLO	Who drove the ice cream...
ARLO	...truck that kept Elvis cool?
MASON	Who had to put a gun to your head?
ARLO	Who put the big hurt on...
ARLO	...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
MASON	You, Arlo.
ARLO	Hello.
MASON	You.
ARLO	Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
ARLO	...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
ARLO	...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
MASON	Us.  Owes us.
ARLO	I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.

MASON	Patriotism is its own reward.
ARLO	I think so too.
MASON	 Yeah.
MASON	Thank you.
ARLO	Thank you very much.
MASON	What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
MASON	...face" crap you've been telling me?
ARLO	I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
ARLO	...-tiatin'.
MASON	Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
MASON	...us.
ARLO	But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
MASON	No.
MASON	That's bullshit.
ARLO	Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
MASON	Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.

ARLO	Oh!
MASON	Oh, oh!
ARLO	I feel faint.
MASON	Ooh.

ARLO	You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
MASON	Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ARLO	It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	I was undercover as a tennis player.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
ARLO	Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
MASON	 big balls.
ARLO	That's right.

ARLO	Hey.
ARLO	Hey, be cool.
ARLO	Be cool.  Be--
ARLO	That was quick.
BRYNNER	To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
BRYNNER	We're worried...
BRYNNER	...about him.
ARLO	I'll keep an eye out.

BRYNNER	Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
BRYNNER	...within five minutes.
ARLO	It's for you.

ARLO	What'd he say?
BRYNNER	Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.

ARLO	Listen, shithead!
ARLO	I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
ARLO	...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
BRYNNER	 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
ARLO	I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

BRYNNER	Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
ARLO	Oh, my God.

BRYNNER	I urge you to be persuasive.
BRYNNER	This country trained me to kill...
BRYNNER	...without compunction.
ARLO	Well, well, well.
ARLO	Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
BRYNNER	Three seconds.  One...



BRYNNER	And it won't be pleasant. 
BRYNNER	But...
BRYNNER	...such is the price...of patriotism.
BRYNNER	Vaughn.
ARLO	Hey!



ARLO	Well, that just about figures for today.
ICE CREAM ANDY	So...where's my truck?
ARLO	It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
ICE CREAM ANDY	I did what I could for you...
ICE CREAM ANDY	...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
ARLO	I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?

ARLO	Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
ARLO	...help you?
ICE CREAM ANDY	 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!

ARLO	Yeah, that's my truck.
LONG	Mason, you have to take this...
LONG	 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
ARLO	Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
ARLO	...take my sorry old truck.
LONG	We do need your truck.

ARLO	So you called the damned thing Elvis
LONG	I had no idea how powerful it was.
LONG	 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
LONG	 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
LONG	...here.   Mason... 
LONG	...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
LONG	You-You can't let him...
LONG	 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
ARLO	  Hey, actually...

PAPPAS	You got a prob-...
PAPPAS	...-lem too?
ARLO	No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
ARLO	Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.

ARLO	Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
PAPPAS	What the hell's a sage?

ARLO	Listen, deputy.
ARLO	He's the dude...
ARLO	...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
PAPPAS	Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

VITELLI	What?  Say again...
VITELLI	 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
ARLO	We've got it...
ARLO	...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
VITELLI	Hold it!

VITELLI	All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
ARLO	Thank you.
VITELLI	Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
VITELLI	...owe you.
ARLO	Us.  Owe us. 

VITELLI	We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
VITELLI	...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
ARLO	Exactly.
VITELLI	However, you are also non-en-...
VITELLI	...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
VITELLI	In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
VITELLI	...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
VITELLI	...including the permanently extreme.
ARLO	I'd say we're about even.





ARLO	Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

MASON & ARLO	Whoo-hoo! 
ARLO	Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!



BIG RANGER	Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
VITELLI	Is it--?
BIG RANGER	Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
VITELLI	Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.

BIG RANGER	They were all wearing hardware.
VITELLI	Any of them Richard Long?
BIG RANGER	No, sir.

BIG RANGER	Yes, sir.

L129042	u4467	m295	VITELLI	And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
L129041	u4467	m295	VITELLI	I can't say it's a surprise.
L129040	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Pleasant surprise.

L129195	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

L128449	u4458	m295	LEWIS	And where are you going?
L128448	u4458	m295	LEWIS	
L128447	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
L128446	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
L128445	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
L128444	u4458	m295	LEWIS	It must've happened right after we left.
L128443	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Thanks. 
L128031	u4458	m295	LEWIS	All right.  Enough. Look...
L128030	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	...son.
L128029	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	That little geek is my...
L128858	u4467	m295	VITELLI	It could be a cover, I suppose.
L128857	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
L128853	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
L128852	u4458	m295	LEWIS	...-son.

L128847	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
L128843	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
L128842	u4458	m295	LEWIS	...colonel?
L128841	u4458	m295	LEWIS	What the hell are you talkin' about...
L128835	u4467	m295	VITELLI	I will tell you what I...
L128834	u4458	m295	LEWIS	I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
L128833	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Uh-huh.
L128832	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.

L127936	u4459	m295	LONG	
L127935	u4463	m295	PUMPER	There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
L127934	u4459	m295	LONG	Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
L127933	u4463	m295	PUMPER	Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
L128952	u4460	m295	MASON	Let me have those.
L128951	u4459	m295	LONG	...that the prey can bite back.
L128950	u4459	m295	LONG	And only then does our noble friend realize...
L128949	u4460	m295	MASON	Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
L128948	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah, I just....
L128144	u4460	m295	MASON	Doctor.

L128141	u4459	m295	LONG	You're the only one I can trust.
L128129	u4459	m295	LONG	Everything will die, Mason.
L128128	u4460	m295	MASON	And what if it does?
L128127	u4459	m295	LONG	Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
L128126	u4460	m295	MASON	Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
L128125	u4459	m295	LONG	 ...or it'll ignite. 
L128124	u4459	m295	LONG	The compound has to be kept cold...
L128096	u4459	m295	LONG	 No...
L128095	u4460	m295	MASON	Call an ambulance.
L128086	u4459	m295	LONG	
L128085	u4460	m295	MASON	Shit!  Oh, shit. 
L128084	u4459	m295	LONG	Mason.
L128081	u4460	m295	MASON	Doc!
L128080	u4459	m295	LONG	
L127849	u4459	m295	LONG	Some people might.
L127848	u4460	m295	MASON	...fishin'.

L127846	u4460	m295	MASON	Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
L127845	u4459	m295	LONG	...is death.
L127844	u4459	m295	LONG	...without caution...
L127843	u4459	m295	LONG	...and that power...
L127842	u4459	m295	LONG	...back...
L127841	u4459	m295	LONG	...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
L127840	u4459	m295	LONG	...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
L127839	u4459	m295	LONG	Tie a fly...
L127838	u4459	m295	LONG	Turn the power of the hunter against him.
L127837	u4459	m295	LONG	There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
L127836	u4459	m295	LONG	How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
L127835	u4459	m295	LONG	...the master of his realm.
L127834	u4459	m295	LONG	...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
L127833	u4459	m295	LONG	He's brains without ambition...
L127832	u4459	m295	LONG	...is a perfect hunter.
L127831	u4459	m295	LONG	 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
L127830	u4460	m295	MASON	...like a fish.
L127829	u4460	m295	MASON	And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
L127828	u4460	m295	MASON	...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
L127827	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
L127826	u4459	m295	LONG	My secret?
L127825	u4460	m295	MASON	Been trying to figure out your secret.
L127824	u4460	m295	MASON	
L127771	u4459	m295	LONG	What?
L127770	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	 ...miles. 
L127769	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
L127768	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	Dr.  Long!
L127723	u4459	m295	LONG	We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
L127722	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
L127721	u4459	m295	LONG	How much longer for the range and power projections?
L127720	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	Well, your prediction was on the nose.
L127719	u4459	m295	LONG	So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
L127718	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
L127717	u4459	m295	LONG	Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
L127716	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	
L129438	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
L129437	u4460	m295	MASON	There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
L129359	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah.
L129358	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Mason.  Mason!
L129322	u4460	m295	MASON	God!  They're gonna seal it.

L129319	u4460	m295	MASON	Forty-seven.
L129318	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
L129243	u4460	m295	MASON	I'm at mile marker...
L129242	u4467	m295	VITELLI	...Mason?
L129241	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Where are you now...
L129240	u4460	m295	MASON	We've got the real thing!
L129239	u4460	m295	MASON	What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
L129238	u4467	m295	VITELLI	...-son.
L129237	u4467	m295	VITELLI	What?  Say again, Ma-...
L129230	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah, yeah...

L129445	u4460	m295	MASON	All right, go.
L129444	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Yeah, I'm sure.
L129443	u4460	m295	MASON	You sure?
L129442	u4460	m295	MASON	 
L129441	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	I'll lead 'em out.
L129440	u4460	m295	MASON	  All right.
L129371	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Jesus.
L129370	u4460	m295	MASON	The Army, sealin' us in.
L129369	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	What the hell was that?
L129342	u4460	m295	MASON	
L129341	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Don't move!
L129340	u4460	m295	MASON	Just go check the temperature.
L129339	u4460	m295	MASON	...tunnel now!
L129338	u4460	m295	MASON	...we're all gonna die in this...
L129337	u4460	m295	MASON	 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
L129331	u4460	m295	MASON	
L129330	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	What happened to Colonel Brynner?
L129329	u4460	m295	MASON	...side!
L129328	u4460	m295	MASON	His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
L129327	u4460	m295	MASON	...on the other end of this phone.
L129326	u4460	m295	MASON	...there's a colonel...
L129325	u4460	m295	MASON	 Listen, Pappas...
L129309	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Now raise 'em!
L129308	u4460	m295	MASON	
L129307	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	...stole a truck under arrest.
L129306	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
L129305	u4460	m295	MASON	...any idea what's goin' on here?!
L129304	u4460	m295	MASON	You redneck idiot, do you have...
L129303	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	I said let me see your hands now!
L129299	u4460	m295	MASON	 Pappas!  Move the car!
L129298	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	...hands!
L129297	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Let me see your...
L128020	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Then how about if I call you ass-...
LONG	...destroyer of worlds."
LONG	No!
LONG	No!
LONG	You'll kill us all!
BRYNNER	Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
LONG	It's too...

LONG	Andrew...
LONG	...I wish they would've let me say something...
LONG	...about--
BRYNNER	There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.

BRYNNER	Is this stool taken?
LONG	No, go--
BRYNNER	You look good, Richard.
BRYNNER	You look fit...healthy...
BRYNNER	...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
BRYNNER	...-ple.
LONG	Is that why you're here?  To blame...
LONG	...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
LONG	I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
LONG	...that.
BRYNNER	Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
BRYNNER	...and the government.
LONG	Grateful?
BRYNNER	Mm-hm.
BRYNNER	Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
BRYNNER	Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
BRYNNER	...you were right, of course.  But after...
BRYNNER	...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
BRYNNER	What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
BRYNNER	...always done, Richard?
LONG	Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
LONG	...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
BRYNNER	Went away? 
BRYNNER	Went away.  I like that.
BRYNNER	Almost quaint.
LONG	All right.  After they put you away...
LONG	...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
BRYNNER	And let me guess.  You failed.
LONG	So far, ye-yes.
BRYNNER	Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...

BRYNNER	Forget about him.

MASON	...seriously.
PAPPAS	That's not the way I...

PAPPAS	Lying? 
PAPPAS	Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
PAPPAS	...public drunkenness....
MASON	I didn't sell the boy any...
MASON	...beer.
PAPPAS	Shut your mouth until I tell you...
PAPPAS	...to talk, son.

FINNEGAN	You the Captain?
CAPTAIN	Yes.
FINNEGAN	How do we get out of here?
CAPTAIN	We have to make it to the third deck...

FINNEGAN	Who are you?
CAPTAIN	He's the owner...
FINNEGAN	Why don't you want a message sent?

FINNEGAN	It's not going to help us!
CAPTAIN	We're going to die here! We're going to die!

CAPTAIN	They are...they are everywhere.
FINNEGAN	All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.

FINNEGAN	Who?
MAMOOLI	Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!

MAMOOLI	We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
FINNEGAN	Boat or no boat...I'm going...

FINNEGAN	Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
MAMOOLI	I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!

FINNEGAN	I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
MAMOOLI	What the hell are you talking about?
FINNEGAN	Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.

MAMOOLI	And what? These things are octopusses?
FINNEGAN	I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...

HANOVER	You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
FINNEGAN	Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
HANOVER	No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
FINNEGAN	You know what they say...the classics are eternal.

FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...
HANOVER	And where is our point of arrival?

FINNEGAN	Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
HANOVER	Which question is that?
FINNEGAN	The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
HANOVER	Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.

HANOVER	Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
FINNEGAN	I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.

HANOVER	This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
FINNEGAN	20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
HANOVER	And no questions asked.
FINNEGAN	Who asked any?
HANOVER	He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
FINNEGAN	I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.

FINNEGAN	Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
HANOVER	How soon can we get up and running?
FINNEGAN	We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
HANOVER	I have a schedule...

HANOVER	We were talking about my schedule...
FINNEGAN	You're going to have to get a new one.
HANOVER	Not an option.
FINNEGAN	Then you better start swimming.

FINNEGAN	Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
HANOVER	And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.

FINNEGAN	I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
HANOVER	I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.

HANOVER	Where are my men?
FINNEGAN	Dead.

FINNEGAN	Hanover, listen...
HANOVER	Shut up!

HANOVER	Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
FINNEGAN	I told you...

HANOVER	Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
FINNEGAN	Did you clear this?
HANOVER	With who?

HANOVER	Who gives a shit about aft?
FINNEGAN	That's where my boat's moored.
HANOVER	You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
FINNEGAN	Just trying to get to my boat...

HANOVER	Maybe we lost them.
FINNEGAN	Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.

TRILLIAN	I'm not staying here!
FINNEGAN	It ain't any better out there!

TRILLIAN	Now look what you did!
FINNEGAN	I saved your life is what I did!
TRILLIAN	Who asked you to!

FINNEGAN	What other bunch?
TRILLIAN	The thieves.
FINNEGAN	I'm not a thief.
TRILLIAN	Then who are you?
FINNEGAN	I'm their ride.

FINNEGAN	Unless you collected on the insurance...
TRILLIAN	What are you people talking about?
FINNEGAN	He's with them.

FINNEGAN	I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
TRILLIAN	You hear that?

TRILLIAN	Noooo!
FINNEGAN	Jesus Christ lady...
TRILLIAN	What are those things?
FINNEGAN	I don't know...

TRILLIAN	Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
FINNEGAN	...there's got to be a way to access out back there...

TRILLIAN	But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
FINNEGAN	Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...

TRILLIAN	You don't have to be so touchy.
FINNEGAN	Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
TRILLIAN	What's that supposed to mean? You people.
FINNEGAN	You people...rich people...
TRILLIAN	I'm not rich people.
FINNEGAN	Well, you sure do a good imitation.
TRILLIAN	Thank you, I work at it...

TRILLIAN	So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
FINNEGAN	That's what I do.
TRILLIAN	Seen a lot of islands?
FINNEGAN	Quite a few.
TRILLIAN	Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
FINNEGAN	Anti social?
TRILLIAN	Self sufficient...

TRILLIAN	Finnegan...
FINNEGAN	Yeah...

FINNEGAN	There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
TRILLIAN	If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
FINNEGAN	Jet ski...there's one left up there.

TRILLIAN	How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
FINNEGAN	Right...

TRILLIAN	You want ME to go up there?
FINNEGAN	Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
TRILLIAN	And what if I run into one of those things?

FINNEGAN	...Jagger was here...I was here...
PANTUCCI	You don't give a shit about anything do you?
FINNEGAN	Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
PANTUCCI	That's it? That's all you give a shit about?

FINNEGAN	Joey... Which way's aft?
PANTUCCI	That way.

PANTUCCI	Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
FINNEGAN	Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...

PANTUCCI	Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
FINNEGAN	Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
PANTUCCI	Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
FINNEGAN	Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
PANTUCCI	For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.

PANTUCCI	Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
FINNEGAN	Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?

PANTUCCI	I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
FINNEGAN	And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.

PANTUCCI	I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
FINNEGAN	I have been.
PANTUCCI	And what have you come up with?
FINNEGAN	How does an island sound to you?

PANTUCCI	Man, don't go up there...
FINNEGAN	One whistle... Start the engine...

PANTUCCI	She's gone...

PANTUCCI	All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
FINNEGAN	You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?

PANTUCCI	Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
FINNEGAN	Joey...
PANTUCCI	Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
FINNEGAN	Joey...
PANTUCCI	Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...

TRILLIAN	Or maybe not.

VIVO	You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
MULLIGAN	What the hell does that mean?
VIVO	Like Mamooli's country...

MULLIGAN	I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.

BISHOP	And if you can't deliver them?
CLAREMONT	<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>

CHOCO	Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.

TARYN	Where is the money?
DOMINO	I don't know.
TARYN	I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
DOMINO	You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.

TARYN	Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
DOMINO	Yes.
TARYN	You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
DOMINO	He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.

DOMINO	He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
TARYN	Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.

TARYN	Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
DOMINO	That's the rumor on the street.
TARYN	What was your business with Lateesha that day?

TARYN	This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.

DOMINO	Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
TARYN	No. Please enlighten me.
DOMINO	I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.

SOPHIE	Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
DOMINO	I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
SOPHIE	Must you use that awful word?
DOMINO	Cunt.
SOPHIE	Stop it.

DOMINO	Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.

DOMINO	You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
ED	Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
DOMINO	No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?

ED	I was a musician.

DOMINO	Really? Did you play in a band?
ED	Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.

DOMINO	I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
ED	Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
DOMINO	Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
ED	We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.

KIMMIE	This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
WEISS	Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
KIMMIE	We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.

WEISS	We're covered on legal with that, right?
KIMMIE	In theory.

KIMMIE	Fast and or furious.
WEISS	But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
KIMMIE	Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.

KIMMIE	This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
WEISS	We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT

KIMMIE	Where is Domino?
WEISS	She went up to her room.

LASHANDRA	You were good.
LASHINDRA	Real good.

LASHANDRA	Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
LASHINDRA	Nobody.

LASHANDRA	<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
LASHINDRA	<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>

LASHANDRA	Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
LASHINDRA	<i>The tough get going.</i>

LASHANDRA	Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
LASHINDRA	Real fast.

BRAZEN	ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
MALLOY	Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
BRAZEN	Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.

MALLOY	Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
BRAZEN	Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.

MALLOY	The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
BRAZEN	It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.

MALLOY	L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
BRAZEN	Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
MALLOY	Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.

BRAZEN	His reactor's starting to overheat.
MALLOY	Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.

BRAZEN	You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
MALLOY	C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.

UTOPIA	Who's that?
CUERVO JONES	You never heard of Snake Plissken?

UTOPIA	He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
CUERVO JONES	Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
UTOPIA	Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.

UTOPIA	Ooww!
CUERVO JONES	Go on now. Do as I say.

UTOPIA	Cuervo...?
CUERVO JONES	You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
UTOPIA	I tried...
CUERVO JONES	Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
UTOPIA	Yes...

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
CUERVO JONES	We'll see.

CUERVO JONES	Where is he?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.

CUERVO JONES	Give it to me.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
CUERVO JONES	Give it.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
CUERVO JONES	You told me he was dead.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I thought he was, but he came back.
CUERVO JONES	Where?

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh Cuervo...
CUERVO JONES	What?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	It's so good to see you again.
CUERVO JONES	Where's Plissken?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He's... near.
CUERVO JONES	You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo, look out behind you!

SPINAL	I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
HERSHE	We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.

HERSHE	Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
SPINAL	Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.

HERSHE	Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
SPINAL	I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.

SPINAL	Shit.
HERSHE	You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.

SPINAL	Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
HERSHE	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?

PLISSKEN	I need a favor.
HERSHE	What's in it for me?

PLISSKEN	Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
HERSHE	Not anymore.

HERSHE	I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
PLISSKEN	Don't lie to me.
HERSHE	All right, so I made another deal.
PLISSKEN	I got a new deal for you.

PLISSKEN	I'm already dead.
HERSHE	I see your point. What's the favor?
PLISSKEN	Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
HERSHE	Dream on, blue eye.
PLISSKEN	Say goodnight, Carjack.

HERSHE	So what's the deal, gorgeous?
PLISSKEN	We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.

HERSHE	I don't know, sounds thin to me.
PLISSKEN	You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
HERSHE	No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
PLISSKEN	I don't know yet.

HERSHE	See you in hell, Snake.
PLISSKEN	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.

PLISSKEN	She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
HERSHE	Somebody get off!

PLISSKEN	I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
HERSHE	Can you land?
PLISSKEN	No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
HERSHE	My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?

MALLOY	How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
PLISSKEN	You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?

MALLOY	Shut up, Plissken.
PLISSKEN	What's the little black box do?
MALLOY	Top secret. Only on a need to know.
PLISSKEN	And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
MALLOY	That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
PLISSKEN	So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
MALLOY	That's the deal.
PLISSKEN	Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.

PLISSKEN	Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
MALLOY	Having second thoughts?
PLISSKEN	Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
MALLOY	You don't understand. It's already in you.

PLISSKEN	Get this crap out of me.
MALLOY	I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
PLISSKEN	Call me Snake.

PLISSKEN	I'll need to know more about this thing.
MALLOY	Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
PLISSKEN	Defense against what?
MALLOY	There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?

MALLOY	Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
PLISSKEN	So what does this thing do?
MALLOY	All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.

PLISSKEN	Where do I put ashore?
MALLOY	Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
PLISSKEN	So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
MALLOY	Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
PLISSKEN	By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
MALLOY	A medical team will be standing by.
PLISSKEN	Not you?
MALLOY	No.
PLISSKEN	Good.

PLISSKEN	She's in the green.
MALLOY	Lock fuel rods.
PLISSKEN	Locked.
MALLOY	Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

PLISSKEN	75% power.
MALLOY	Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.

MALLOY	Plissken...?
PLISSKEN	I'm here.
MALLOY	Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
PLISSKEN	It's history. I gotta go.

MALLOY	Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
PLISSKEN	Yeah, I got it.

PLISSKEN	Got a smoke?
MALLOY	You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
PLISSKEN	The name's Plissken.

MALLOY	It's the President, for Christ's sake!
PRESIDENT	I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.

MALLOY	Getting ready to invade.
PRESIDENT	So where's Plissken?

MALLOY	The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
PRESIDENT	Does he know how to activate it?
MALLOY	Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.

MALLOY	Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
PRESIDENT	You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
PLISSKEN	Where'd they go?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.

PLISSKEN	Where are they?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.

PLISSKEN	Location.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
PLISSKEN	Delgado?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.

PLISSKEN	Stop the damn car.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	No way.
PLISSKEN	I said pull over.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.

PLISSKEN	Where is it?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right over there.

PLISSKEN	Where are they going?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

PLISSKEN	Not yet.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...

PLISSKEN	Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
PLISSKEN	Later.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
PLISSKEN	Cease fire with the bullshit.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.

PLISSKEN	How do you know all this?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Me too?
PLISSKEN	We'll see.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Aw, come on, Snake.
PLISSKEN	Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I don't know about this thing.
PLISSKEN	Don't like it, don't come.

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
PLISSKEN	Yeah, kinda.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
PLISSKEN	If he lets you get close enough.

PLISSKEN	Is that what I think it is?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.

PENDEJO BOB	What're you doing in here?
PLISSKEN	Looking to get out.
PENDEJO BOB	Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
PLISSKEN	Which way?

PENDEJO BOB	Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
PLISSKEN	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
PENDEJO BOB	All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.

PIPELINE	Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
PLISSKEN	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
PIPELINE	Down that way.

PIPELINE	Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
PLISSKEN	Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
PIPELINE	Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
PLISSKEN	Where?
PIPELINE	Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.

PIPELINE	You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
PLISSKEN	Who?
PIPELINE	Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.

TASLIMA	Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
PLISSKEN	Are you crazy?
TASLIMA	A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.

PLISSKEN	What are they?
TASLIMA	They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
PLISSKEN	No screamin' shit.
TASLIMA	Oh no, it's the Doctor.
PLISSKEN	Who?
TASLIMA	The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.

PLISSKEN	Don't follow me.
TASLIMA	You need help.
PLISSKEN	Like hell I do.

PLISSKEN	This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
TASLIMA	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.

TASLIMA	Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
PLISSKEN	The what?

PLISSKEN	How do we get out of here?
TASLIMA	Sewers. Come on.

TASLIMA	Snake - what is it?
PLISSKEN	How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.

PLISSKEN	Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
TASLIMA	I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

TASLIMA	I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
PLISSKEN	What the hell is this?
TASLIMA	The freeway.
PLISSKEN	I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
TASLIMA	It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.

TASLIMA	What are you gonna do in Venice?
PLISSKEN	Find Cuervo Jones.
TASLIMA	No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.

TASLIMA	Run, Snake...They're coming.
PLISSKEN	Who?

PLISSKEN	I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
PRESIDENT	Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
PLISSKEN	Well, I'll think it over.
PRESIDENT	You're running out of time.
PLISSKEN	I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.

PLISSKEN	Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
PRESIDENT	Thank God.

PLISSKEN	Where's the anti-toxin...?
PRESIDENT	Give me the prototype.

SPINAL	Hey, what's going down, Snake?
PLISSKEN	I'm looking for somebody.
SPINAL	Who ain't?

PLISSKEN	You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
SPINAL	Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
PLISSKEN	Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.

SPINAL	All of us?
PLISSKEN	Yeah.

PLISSKEN	The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
SPINAL	Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
PLISSKEN	Uh-uh. Bluebacks.

THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
THE THING	This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.

THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
THE THING	I mean...
ALICIA	Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?

ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.

BEN	How'd you know it was me?
ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
BEN	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...

BEN	Those yours too?
ALICIA	My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.

ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
BEN	I like the sound of that.

BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.

REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
BEN	You'd never know it.

BEN	I can't take this.
REED	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.

BEN	What about his first born?
REED	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.

BEN	He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
BEN	Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
REED	We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
BEN	I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...

BEN	Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
BEN	No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
REED	Youthful high spirits.

BEN	They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.

REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
BEN	Five times.
REED	I had it at four.
BEN	This makes five.

BEN	Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
REED	He's made a few changes.
BEN	This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
REED	Victor's better at these things.

REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
BEN	<u>Should</u>?

BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
REED	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.

BEN	How long was I out?
REED	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
BEN	Solid.

REED	I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
BEN	Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
REED	I should have done more, run more tests --

BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

REED	What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
BEN	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.

REED	Are you alright?
BEN	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.

BEN	What the --!
REED	Ben.  Are you okay?
BEN	Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!

REED	We had a tough year.
BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.

BEN	You got a chisel round here?
REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

REED	Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
REED	O-kay.  We'll skip that question.

BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.

REED	Ben --
BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
REED	We're working as hard as we can --
BEN	Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

BEN	Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--

REED	Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
BEN	Got it, teach.

REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
BEN	Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

BEN	What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.

JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
BEN	Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.

JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
BEN	'Course not.  Strictly business.
JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.

BEN	Where...where am I?
JOHNNY	Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
BEN	Reed? ... Sue?
JOHNNY	They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.

BEN	What's wrong with me?
JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
BEN	Give me a mirror...

JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!

JOHNNY	Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
BEN	Go back to the drawing board.

BEN	The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
JOHNNY	Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.

BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.

BEN	I'll be watching over you.
DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.

BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.

BEN	Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
DEBBIE	Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.

DEBBIE	Ben?
BEN	Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.

DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
BEN	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
BEN	I already got it.  Everything I want.

BEN	What are <u>you</u> doing here?
VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
BEN	About me?  How sweet.
VICTOR	Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.

VICTOR	Ben, come in.
BEN	What is this?  Where's Reed?
VICTOR	Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.

BEN	What do you want, Vic?
VICTOR	To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.

BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
VICTOR	He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.

VICTOR	He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
BEN	And you can?  Power it up?

BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
SUE	I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

BEN	I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
SUE	Victor did.

SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
BEN	Is it safe?

SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
BEN	Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?

BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
SUE	The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

SUE	He didn't.
BEN	Oh, he did.
SUE	<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!

SUE	He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
BEN	It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
SUE	No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.

SUE	<u>Where is Reed</u>?
BEN	Victor must've taken him.

DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
VICTOR	And they're changing into...
DOCTOR	I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
VICTOR	What do you mean "complete"?
DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

VICTOR	What?
DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --

DOCTOR	But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
VICTOR	That's terrible news...

REED	Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
JOHNNY	What about you?

REED	He's not responsive --
JOHNNY	Ben!  Ben!

JOHNNY	Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
JOHNNY	Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
REED	Ben, are you there?

JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
REED	You've been working out.

REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...

JOHNNY	Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
REED	Oh, it is.

REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
JOHNNY	This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

REED	Back it down, Johnny!
JOHNNY	I can go hotter!

REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
JOHNNY	Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.

REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
JOHNNY	What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
REED	What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?

JOHNNY	He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
REED	They're not costumes.

REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.

REED	You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
JOHNNY	Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?

REED	Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
JOHNNY	But all these people...
REED	<u>Now</u>.

SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
JOHNNY	I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --

SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
JOHNNY	So are you!
SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.

JOHNNY	Me like-y.
SEXY NURSE	Stay right.  Left is trouble.
JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.

SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
JOHNNY	Not this again --
SEXY NURSE	No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!

SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!

SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
JOHNNY	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.

JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
SUE	Johnny.

SUE	Stop it.
JOHNNY	Okay, "mom."

JOHNNY	What is that <i>thing</i>?
SUE	I think that thing is Ben.

JOHNNY	Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
SUE	Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
JOHNNY	Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.

JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
JOHNNY	Sweet.
SUE	That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.

JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
SUE	<u>Girl</u>...?!

SUE	I'm driving.
JOHNNY	Dude.  That's my sister.

JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
SUE	You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

SUE	You two need a time-out.
JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!

SUE	Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
SUE	Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

SUE	Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
JOHNNY	Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
SUE	As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.

JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
SUE	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.

SUE	What are you doing --
JOHNNY	Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
SUE	But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.

VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
LEONARD	And if he's not...?
VICTOR	Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...

LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
VICTOR	Showtime.

LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
VICTOR	It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
LEONARD	Then what is it?
VICTOR	History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?

VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
LEONARD	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

VICTOR	How's the IPO?
LEONARD	Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
VICTOR	Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
LEONARD	Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
VICTOR	And that's a <u>good</u> thing?

LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
VICTOR	Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...

LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
VICTOR	<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."

VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
LEONARD	Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
VICTOR	Front page?
LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.

VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
REED	You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...

VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
REED	Not at all.

REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
VICTOR	The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.

VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
REED	Hilarious.

VICTOR	Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
REED	Sure.

REED	We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
VICTOR	Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
REED	Ben's still out there --
VICTOR	So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.

REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.

REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.

VICTOR	Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
REED	Ben did this.
VICTOR	<u>Ben</u> did this?
REED	He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.

VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
REED	Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.

VICTOR	Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
REED	<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
VICTOR	<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
VICTOR	I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!

REED	What are you doing here?
VICTOR	What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
VICTOR	Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.

REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
SUE	Never better.

REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
SUE	I was talking about us.  Working together.

REED	Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
SUE	Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
SUE	It's been changed.

REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...

REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
SUE	Great minds think alike.

REED	Feeling better?
SUE	Yes, thanks.
REED	That's good.  That's uh...good.
SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.

SUE	You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
SUE	Which was?
REED	Passion.

REED	For science.
SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.

REED	Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
SUE	What?  What do you mean you --
REED	Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.

SUE	It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.

SUE	What?
REED	We need to get past them.

REED	Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
SUE	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.

SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
REED	That's what we're here to find out.
SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...

REED	It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
SUE	What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?

REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
SUE	Excuse me?

REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
SUE	Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
REED	Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.

SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
REED	What in the world would give me that idea?

REED	I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
SUE	Are you kidding?
REED	No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...

SUE	Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?

REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
SUE	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.

SUE	What are you doing?
REED	The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.

REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
SUE	And reverse the mutations --
REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.

SUE	But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
REED	Of course.  Of course.
SUE	And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...

SUE	Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
REED	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.

SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
SUE	Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.

REED	Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
SUE	Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
REED	<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.

REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
SUE	Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.

SUE	Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
REED	You <u>were</u>?
SUE	Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
SUE	I gave him twenty.

REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
SUE	I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.

SUE	When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
REED	Why didn't you say something?
SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.

REED	I can...make it work.
SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
REED	The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
SUE	You <u>need</u> a doctor.

REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.

REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
SUE	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.

SUE	It's just business.
VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
SUE	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.

SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

SUE	What are you doing?
VICTOR	Raising the shields.
SUE	You can't leave them out there.

VICTOR	What's going on?
SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?

SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
VICTOR	Just <u>find</u> him.

SUE	Victor, your scar --
VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
VICTOR	Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.

SUE	You said it was urgent.
VICTOR	It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...

SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
VICTOR	Susan.  What are you doing?

SUE	He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
VICTOR	Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?

SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.

SUE	Please don't make this personal --
VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
SUE	Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.

THE THING	'Scuse me.
VICTOR	I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.

THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
THE THING	Skeptical...?

DE FRAVIO	You guys are real... aren't you?
BREWER	Huh?
DE FRAVIO	Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
BREWER	That's right, buddy.

DE FRAVIO	I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
BREWER	No.
DE FRAVIO	What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?

BREWER	You mean the snake?
DE FRAVIO	Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
BREWER	What's that?
DE FRAVIO	Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.

DE FRAVIO	Wow!
BREWER	What just happened?

DE FRAVIO	Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
BREWER	Really?  How come he didn't take me?
DE FRAVIO	Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
BREWER	Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?

BREWER	Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
DE FRAVIO	Star Wars?

BREWER	... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
DE FRAVIO	There's the Mekong.

RAMBO	This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
BREWER	Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

BREWER	Ever do this from a jet?
RAMBO	No.

RAMBO	Again.
BREWER	Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
RAMBO	You stopped.

BREWER	Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
RAMBO	Start over.

BREWER	... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
RAMBO	Ninety.
BREWER	... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
RAMBO	One hundred.

BREWER	Gettin' old, huh?
RAMBO	Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.

BREWER	No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
RAMBO	Show me how it operates.
BREWER	That's what I'm here for.
RAMBO	Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
BREWER	We're leaving tonight, not in a week.

BREWER	Yeah.  Why not?
RAMBO	You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.

RAMBO	You read me, Brewer?
BREWER	Read you.
RAMBO	Home on my strobe.

RAMBO	You okay?
BREWER	Keep it down, man.  I got problems.

RAMBO	What do you call that?
BREWER	Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
RAMBO	Batteries not included.
BREWER	This is state-of-the-art firepower.

RAMBO	What's this?
BREWER	AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.

RAMBO	Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
BREWER	Where's your stuff?

BREWER	That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
RAMBO	There's a compass in the handle.

BREWER	And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
RAMBO	Exactly.

BREWER	You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
RAMBO	No.
BREWER	I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
RAMBO	That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
BREWER	I've seen worse places.
RAMBO	There are no worse places.

BREWER	This place is a trip.
RAMBO	Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
BREWER	Damn!  Leeches.

BREWER	You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
RAMBO	No cigarettes.
BREWER	I had it cupped.

BREWER	What's this stuff on the rice?
RAMBO	Fermented fish sauce.

RAMBO	Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
BREWER	Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

RAMBO	We'll check it out.
BREWER	How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
RAMBO	Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
BREWER	Yeah...

BREWER	What's she saying?
RAMBO	She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
BREWER	What's that?
RAMBO	Powerful warrior.
BREWER	Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?

BREWER	These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
RAMBO	Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
BREWER	Pirates?  No kidding?

RAMBO	How you doing, Brewer?
BREWER	I need a vacation.

BREWER	Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
RAMBO	Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

BREWER	It's a guy in a cage.
RAMBO	American?
BREWER	Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
RAMBO	Let me see.

RAMBO	Roundeye.
BREWER	Alright.  Home run.
RAMBO	Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
BREWER	Bastards.  Let's get some shots.

RAMBO	That guy's not going to make it.
BREWER	Nothing we can do, man.

RAMBO	I'm getting him out.
BREWER	What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
RAMBO	You never been in one of those things.
BREWER	I suppose you have...

BREWER	It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
RAMBO	You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.

RAMBO	You better take off.
BREWER	Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?

BREWER	Are they going to torture us?
RAMBO	Yes.
BREWER	What... whattaya do?

BREWER	Gawd, you look awful.
RAMBO	You comin'?
BREWER	Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.

RAMBO	Can you handle the door gun?
BREWER	Duck soup.

RAMBO	Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
BREWER	It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
RAMBO	Forget it.

BREWER	You're gonna love it.
RAMBO	How much we got left in that minigun?

RAMBO	I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
CO	It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.

RAMBO	You really got a Masters Degree?
CO	Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.

RAMBO	How do we get upriver?
CO	I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
RAMBO	Why's that?
CO	I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.

CO	Where did you find this clown?
RAMBO	I thought he was with you.
CO	Crazy motherfucker.

RAMBO	How did you get started working for the spooks?
CO	Spooks?
RAMBO	Intelligence work.
CO	Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

CO	Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
RAMBO	Where's his father?

RAMBO	Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
CO	Huntington Beach, California.
RAMBO	It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
CO	Nguyen is good boy.

RAMBO	Are you okay?
CO	Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
RAMBO	Why'd they want us?
CO	They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

RAMBO	Thanks.
CO	Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
RAMBO	Let's go.

RAMBO	Christ.  How'd you get here?
CO	Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.

RAMBO	And how'd you sneak up like that?
CO	Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
RAMBO	I do?
CO	You think you are... .
RAMBO	Invulnerable.
CO	In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.

CO	You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
RAMBO	Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
CO	Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
RAMBO	How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
CO	I know.  I go with you.
RAMBO	I couldn't get you in.

CO	Yes you can.
RAMBO	How?

RAMBO	Look, Co...
CO	Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!

CO	What was that?
RAMBO	Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.

RAMBO	John.  My name is John.
CO	It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?

TRAUTMAN	Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
DOYLE	Let's get that tent down!

TRAUTMAN	Stay on your heading, Captain.
DOYLE	Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
TRAUTMAN	That's an order.
DOYLE	Sorry, Sir.

TRAUTMAN	You pathetic scum.
DOYLE	Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.

RAMBO	I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
KIRKHILL	I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
RAMBO	What's the job?
KIRKHILL	Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
RAMBO	Why me?
KIRKHILL	We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
RAMBO	Where?
KIRKHILL	Not yet.
RAMBO	I'm not jumping blind.

KIRKHILL	Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
RAMBO	What's the plan?
KIRKHILL	This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
RAMBO	We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
KIRKHILL	Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
RAMBO	We just take pictures?
KIRKHILL	Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.

KIRKHILL	I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
RAMBO	I was crossed-trained in gunships.

RAMBO	All this is for us?
KIRKHILL	That's right.

KIRKHILL	He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
TECH	Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
KIRKHILL	Typical...
TECH	Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
KIRKHILL	What?

TECH	Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
KIRKHILL	Christ almighty.
TECH	... and then he, uh... took the other one.
KIRKHILL	What?
TECH	He... took it.

TRAUTMAN	How long have you been setting up?
KIRKHILL	About 22 hours on site.
TRAUTMAN	Nice work.

TRAUTMAN	How long before you're fully on line?
KIRKHILL	Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.

TRAUTMAN	You think they'll find any?
KIRKHILL	POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
TRAUTMAN	Black.  No sugar.
KIRKHILL	The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!

KIRKHILL	What's up?
TRAUTMAN	Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
KIRKHILL	It's not necessary.
TRAUTMAN	I know.
KIRKHILL	That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.

TRAUTMAN	I know...
KIRKHILL	Have fun.

TRAUTMAN	Take your time.
KIRKHILL	Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
TRAUTMAN	Not my people.

TRAUTMAN	But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
KIRKHILL	You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
TRAUTMAN	Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.

KIRKHILL	Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
TRAUTMAN	This mission was a scam from the word go?
KIRKHILL	Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.

TRAUTMAN	Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
KIRKHILL	It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
TRAUTMAN	Terminate with extreme prejudice.
KIRKHILL	That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.

TRAUTMAN	So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
KIRKHILL	Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

KIRKHILL	You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
TRAUTMAN	It's not over.  You made one mistake.
KIRKHILL	What that?

PRISONER	Who're you?
RAMBO	American.  Come to get you out.
PRISONER	Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
RAMBO	Can you walk?
PRISONER	I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.

RAMBO	What's your name?
PRISONER	De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.

TRAUTMAN	Hello, John.
RAMBO	Colonel.
TRAUTMAN	Mind if I sit down?

TRAUTMAN	I hear you're not enjoying it here.
RAMBO	I could take it or leave it.

TRAUTMAN	Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
RAMBO	Am I out of here?
TRAUTMAN	That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
RAMBO	There were treating me like a headcase.
TRAUTMAN	Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?

TRAUTMAN	This your stuff?
RAMBO	That's it.  My life.

TRAUTMAN	Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
RAMBO	Those men are all dead.
TRAUTMAN	You're not.

TRAUTMAN	Congressional Medal of Honor.
RAMBO	Yeah.  Big time.
TRAUTMAN	Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
RAMBO	Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
TRAUTMAN	What did you want?
RAMBO	I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
TRAUTMAN	You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.

TRAUTMAN	We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
RAMBO	This just occurred to somebody, now?

TRAUTMAN	Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
RAMBO	I say we tape him to a chair.

RAMBO	Let's do it.
TRAUTMAN	Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
RAMBO	You got it, sir.

FORD	But I ain't got you...
BAND	But I ain't got you...
FORD	No, I ain't got you...
BAND	No, I ain't got you...
FORD	I said, I ain't got you...
BAND	I said, I ain't got you...
FORD	I ain't -- got -- you.

COLLEEN	Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
FORD	Don't say it.  Orange juice?
COLLEEN	Please.

FORD	Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
COLLEEN	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
FORD	I don't know, I never met your father.

FORD	Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
COLLEEN	Who's your decorator?
FORD	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
COLLEEN	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
FORD	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
COLLEEN	I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.

FORD	Now that we've broken the ice...
COLLEEN	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
FORD	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
COLLEEN	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...

FORD	No thanks.  I carry my own.
COLLEEN	Excuse me?
FORD	Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.

COLLEEN	Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
FORD	Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
COLLEEN	Actually, you may take it all now.
FORD	Oh... I have some questions.
COLLEEN	I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.

FORD	Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
COLLEEN	Who?
FORD	Nuthin'.

COLLEEN	My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
FORD	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
COLLEEN	Uh, let's go sit down.

COLLEEN	So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
FORD	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.

FORD	Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
COLLEEN	So you...
FORD	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
COLLEEN	Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
FORD	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
COLLEEN	I'll do my best.
FORD	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.

COLLEEN	Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
FORD	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.

COLLEEN	I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
FORD	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
COLLEEN	Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
FORD	Have what?
COLLEEN	Did she tell you anything?
FORD	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
COLLEEN	Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...

COLLEEN	Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
FORD	But I am...

FORD	What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
COLLEEN	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
FORD	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?

COLLEEN	That was close...
FORD	What did these Vancouver factories do?

COLLEEN	Art Mo-o-o-ney!
FORD	Thanks, I needed that.

FORD	So many assholes, so few bullets.
DON	Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
FORD	I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
DON	Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...

DON	You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
FORD	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...

DON	I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
FORD	Great pipes.

FORD	I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
DON	Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.

DON	Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
FORD	I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.

FORD	Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
DON	Right away!

FORD	Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
DON	Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...

DON	Thanks for the promotion, man.
FORD	No prob...

FORD	Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
JAZZ	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
FORD	All your friends call you Jazz.
JAZZ	Exactly.

JAZZ	You wish.
FORD	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.

FORD	I do it for love.
JAZZ	'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.

JAZZ	G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
FORD	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
JAZZ	Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
FORD	Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
JAZZ	You're saying you need money.
FORD	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
JAZZ	Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...

JAZZ	You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
FORD	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?

JAZZ	That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
FORD	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.

JAZZ	So what about this watch?
FORD	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.

FORD	Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
JAZZ	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?

FORD	Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
JAZZ	Spooky.  I'll process her.
FORD	Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.

FORD	Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
JAZZ	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
FORD	This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...

FORD	You going to be okay?
JAZZ	Go on, 'they're stahting.'

FORD	And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
JAZZ	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.

FORD	Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
JAZZ	Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.

FORD	How'd you get this from her?
JAZZ	You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
FORD	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
JAZZ	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
FORD	I wish I knew.  You did good work...
JAZZ	Make eye contact when you say that.
FORD	I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
JAZZ	Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.

FORD	What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
JAZZ	Contacts.
FORD	I like.

FORD	I don't know, what was the case?
JAZZ	Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
FORD	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.

JAZZ	She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
FORD	Yeah, let's bury her.
JAZZ	Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.

JAZZ	You okay?
FORD	Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
JAZZ	Who?

JAZZ	Ah, an obvious choice.
FORD	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

JAZZ	Hello, Ford...
FORD	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.

JAZZ	I came to warn you...
FORD	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!

JAZZ	I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
FORD	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...

FORD	Aha, just what I suspected!
JAZZ	You're not funny.

JAZZ	Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
FORD	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...

FORD	Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
JAZZ	Johnny's C.D.?

FORD	What an interface!
JAZZ	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
FORD	Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
JAZZ	C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
FORD	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
JAZZ	But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.

FORD	After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
JAZZ	I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s

JAZZ	I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
FORD	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
JAZZ	Wha --

SLEAZY GUY	Got those Vomit invites here...
FORD	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
SLEAZY GUY	Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
FORD	How much?
SLEAZY GUY	Three hundred.
FORD	You gave it to the girls for one.
SLEAZY GUY	Hey, they blew me.
FORD	Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.

FORD	Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
ZUZU	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.

FORD	A simple 'please' would suffice...
ZUZU	Fluck you!

ZUZU	It's red, Ford.
FORD	What?

ZUZU	Hello?
FORD	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.

FORD	You okay?
ZUZU	Peachy.

FORD	Let's get serious...
ZUZU	Why are all these people after me?
FORD	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
ZUZU	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

FORD	You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
ZUZU	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
FORD	What?  Jesus, tell me!
ZUZU	It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!

ZUZU	Spunk, come back...
FORD	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
ZUZU	Because I know rock-n-roll.
FORD	You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
ZUZU	Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.

FORD	Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
ZUZU	No.  Who's Art Mooney?
FORD	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...

ZUZU	Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
FORD	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
ZUZU	You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?

ZUZU	Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
FORD	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
ZUZU	What a perv...

ZUZU	Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
FORD	People still watch that?
ZUZU	Who cares about people?

FORD	Zuzu, wake up...
ZUZU	Hah fluck, great video, huh?
FORD	Are you okay?
ZUZU	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.

FORD	My axe!
ZUZU	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?

ZUZU	I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
FORD	Ye-ah.  Sure.

ZUZU	This is boring, guys.
FORD	Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.

ZUZU	Ford, you were right!
FORD	Ye-ah.

FORD	I'm afraid so, you want her?
ZUZU	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.

ZUZU	Nice left you got there, jerk.
FORD	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.

ZUZU	This way...
FORD	No, wait...

ZUZU	Suck a dick, I left my purse...
FORD	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
ZUZU	Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
FORD	Ye-ah.

FORD	Pretty smooth, huh?
ZUZU	Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
FORD	Why have you come to my planet?

ZUZU	Ick.
FORD	I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?

FORD	Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
ZUZU	Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.

FORD	I can't kill this kid's father...
ZUZU	Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
FORD	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...

ZUZU	Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
FORD	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.

FORD	Are you okay?
ZUZU	There's that question...

ZUZU	Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
FORD	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.

ZUZU	You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
FORD	I'll mail you a letter, come on!

ZUZU	Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
FORD	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.

FORD	So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
ZUZU	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.

THE KID	Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
FORD	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

THE KID	Gut feeling.
FORD	I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...

THE KID	When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
FORD	Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.

THE KID	I got something serious to dis-cuss.
FORD	Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
THE KID	Forget it.

THE KID	Ouch.
FORD	Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
THE KID	Who cares?  I got a case.
FORD	Twelve pack?

THE KID	This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
FORD	Did he just say what I think he said?
THE KID	I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.

FORD	Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
THE KID	You need it.
FORD	I don't need it that bad.

THE KID	I'm sorry...
FORD	Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
THE KID	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
FORD	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
THE KID	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
FORD	Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.

THE KID	I tried to help you...!
FORD	And hey, I appreciate it...
THE KID	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
FORD	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
THE KID	Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.

THE KID	So, did you find my dad?
FORD	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
THE KID	Yeah, go on...
FORD	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...

FORD	It's me.
THE KID	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
FORD	Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
THE KID	Who's my real father, man?
FORD	He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.

FORD	I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
THE KID	Shut the heck up... Pop.

FORD	Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
LT. AMOS	You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
FORD	You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
LT. AMOS	Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?

LT. AMOS	What are you running from?
FORD	Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
LT. AMOS	If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
FORD	Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
LT. AMOS	Two words.  Disco Express.
FORD	Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
LT. AMOS	'Booty Time.'
FORD	Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
LT. AMOS	Like me.
FORD	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
LT. AMOS	'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
FORD	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.

LT. AMOS	Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
FORD	That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
LT. AMOS	God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
FORD	Really?

LT. AMOS	It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
FORD	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
LT. AMOS	That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.

SMILEY	Polo.
FORD	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.

SMILEY	Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
FORD	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
SMILEY	Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
FORD	Fine!
SMILEY	What's fine?
FORD	I'm off it!
SMILEY	Off what?  Twenty seconds...
FORD	The case!
SMILEY	Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
FORD	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.

FORD	You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
SMILEY	Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
FORD	Say cheese...

FORD	I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
SMILEY	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
FORD	Okay.  'B-y-e!

SMILEY	How's it going?
FORD	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
SMILEY	The point?
FORD	Let me go out like a man.
SMILEY	Anyway you want it, asshole.

FORD	How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
GRENDEL	Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...

GRENDEL	Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
FORD	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
GRENDEL	Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.

FORD	I knew your father.  He was quite...
GRENDEL	An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.

GRENDEL	Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
FORD	I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?

GRENDEL	Well, hello, Ford.
FORD	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
GRENDEL	I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.

GRENDEL	So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
FORD	Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
GRENDEL	Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...

FORD	Jazz, we're talking here.
GRENDEL	Go on, another time, another place.

FORD	Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
GRENDEL	Shock.
FORD	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
GRENDEL	Golly, I'd probably faint.

GRENDEL	Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
FORD	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
GRENDEL	Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.

GRENDEL	It doesn't have to be like this?
FORD	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!

FORD	<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
GRENDEL	It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
FORD	Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?

FORD	I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
GRENDEL	I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
FORD	What about Don?
GRENDEL	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.

GRENDEL	Kill them.  Not quickly.
FORD	Are you okay?

FORD	When I say 'no,' run for the door.
GRENDEL	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.

FORD	Shit.
GRENDEL	Ciao.

FORD	You'd said something about proof...
GRENDEL	Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --

FORD	And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
GRENDEL	Fuck me...
FORD	Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
GRENDEL	When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
FORD	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
GRENDEL	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?

FORD	Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
GRENDEL	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.

GRENDEL	I'm still the king!
FORD	Julian, you're fired.

MELODI	You're that guy, the private eye.
FORD	You're a poet and didn't know it.
MELODI	Do you really know everybody in the industry?
FORD	Only on a first name basis.
MELODI	That's cute.  You're funny.
FORD	That's funny, you're cute.
MELODI	You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
FORD	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

MELODI	Hi, private eye guy!
FORD	Hey, the poet...

MELODI	Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
FORD	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.

MELODI	This isn't music!
FORD	It is to us!  It's computerised.

FORD	I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
JOHNNY	Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
FORD	Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
JOHNNY	I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
FORD	Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.

FORD	How nice.
JOHNNY	It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
FORD	'Bye, Johnny...
JOHNNY	What?

JOHNNY	So...
FORD	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
JOHNNY	Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.

JOHNNY	I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
FORD	Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
JOHNNY	I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.

ALBERT	Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
CARTER	Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
ALBERT	I know. I know.

CARTER	You can't get away from me, Albert.
ALBERT	I know.

ALBERT	I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
CARTER	Did Eric Pake pull her?
ALBERT	Yes.
CARTER	How?
ALBERT	I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
CARTER	When did you find out?
ALBERT	A couple of weeks back.
CARTER	How?
ALBERT	No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
CARTER	Who?
ALBERT	Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
CARTER	And you told Brumby?

CARTER	Do you want to be dead, Albert?
ALBERT	Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
CARTER	What did you do?  Albert?
ALBERT	Nothing. What could I do?
CARTER	Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
ALBERT	Yes. I told him.
CARTER	What did he say?
ALBERT	'Good.'

CARTER	You knew what I'd do.
ALBERT	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.

BILLY	What do you want?
CARTER	What happened to this car?
BILLY	What's it got to do with you?
CARTER	This is my brother's car.
BILLY	Oh ay?
CARTER	Yeah.
BILLY	Well, he drove it into the river.
CARTER	Was the steering faulty?

CARTER	What about the brakes?
BILLY	Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
CARTER	How'd it happen, then?
BILLY	He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
CARTER	Was he?

BRUMBY	You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
CARTER	I know.
BRUMBY	Well?

CARTER	I made a mistake.
BRUMBY	What?
CARTER	I made a mistake.
BRUMBY	What about?
CARTER	Never mind.

BRUMBY	Bloody well tell me who sent you.
CARTER	You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.

BRUMBY	A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
CARTER	Yes.
BRUMBY	Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.

BRUMBY	Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
CARTER	What name?
BRUMBY	Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
CARTER	Why?
BRUMBY	I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
CARTER	Why?
BRUMBY	I don't know. That's all I was told.

CARTER	That's not good enough.
BRUMBY	Christ, what...
CARTER	Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
BRUMBY	Jack, you're wrong.
CARTER	Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
BRUMBY	Jack...

CARTER	You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
BRUMBY	I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.

THORPE	Jack?
CARTER	Good evening.
THORPE	I'd like a word with you, Jack.
CARTER	That's nice.
THORPE	Confidential, like.
CARTER	You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

THORPE	Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
CARTER	That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
THORPE	I've been asked to make sure you don't.
CARTER	Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?

CARTER	Who paid you to see me off?
THORPE	I can't Jack. How can I?
CARTER	Yes you can.

THORPE	No, don't Jack, don't.
CARTER	Who sent you, Thorpey?
THORPE	Brumby!

CARTER	Where's he living these days?
THORPE	He's got a new place at Burnham.
CARTER	Address?
THORPE	On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

THORPE	Can I go now?
CARTER	You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.

MARGARET	Everyhing go off all right?
CARTER	Fine...  I want to talk to you.
MARGARET	What about?
CARTER	Doreen.

MARGARET	She's nothing to do with me.
CARTER	What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
MARGARET	No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.

CARTER	Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
MARGARET	Killed?  I don't know anything about it.

CARTER	Really.
MARGARET	I must go. I'm in a hurry.
CARTER	I want to talk to you later.
MARGARET	I can't.
CARTER	Tomorrow morning, then?

CARTER	How were things between you and Frank?
MARGARET	He was all right to me.
CARTER	Nothing more? Just another feller?
MARGARET	Nicer than most.
CARTER	But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
MARGARET	Yes.
CARTER	Though nicer than most?
MARGARET	Yes. I can't help the way I am.
CARTER	Why'd you see him so regular?
MARGARET	Once a week?
CARTER	I call that regular.
MARGARET	He was gentlemanly. I like that.
CARTER	Once a week you like a gentleman?
MARGARET	Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
CARTER	What was bugging Frank?
MARGARET	He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.

CARTER	I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
MARGARET	It's the truth.

MARGARET	It is. Honestly.
CARTER	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
MARGARET	I don't know nothing.

GLENDA	You know Sid Fletcher?
CARTER	What?
GLENDA	You know Sid Fletcher?
CARTER	I work for him.
GLENDA	Do you?
CARTER	Yes, I do.

GLENDA	I know him too.
CARTER	Who?
GLENDA	Sid Fletcher.
CARTER	Oh, do you?
GLENDA	Yes.
CARTER	No, do you really?

GLENDA	Yes. I met him last year.
CARTER	Go on.
GLENDA	Oh yes. When he came up on business.
CARTER	Really?
GLENDA	He came to see Mr Kinnear.
CARTER	No.

GLENDA	We went about together.
CARTER	Really?
GLENDA	Yes, while he was here.
CARTER	While he was here. You went about together?
GLENDA	He was here for four days.
CARTER	Was he?
GLENDA	Could you do me a favour?
CARTER	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
GLENDA	Could you please put my glass on the table?

GLENDA	You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
CARTER	No. I didn't know that.
GLENDA	A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
CARTER	So where are we going, Princess?
GLENDA	To the demon king's castle, of course.
CARTER	Of course. Where else?

CARTER	How'd you know where I'd be?
GLENDA	You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
CARTER	Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
GLENDA	Nasty.
CARTER	He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
GLENDA	Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
CARTER	And what was that?
GLENDA	We're there now.

CARTER	Who's setting you up in this place?
GLENDA	Brumby.
CARTER	Is he coming here?
GLENDA	Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.

CARTER	Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
GLENDA	He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

CARTER	What does he want that bloody great country place for?
GLENDA	Entertaining.
CARTER	What kind of entertaining?
GLENDA	Now you're asking.

CARTER	Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
GLENDA	Especially when I play the lead.

GLENDA	That's why you waited for me.
CARTER	Not entirely. No.
GLENDA	You sure about that?
CARTER	Sure I'm sure.

CARTER	I want to give you an Oscar.
GLENDA	You've been watching the film.
CARTER	Tell me about the girl.
GLENDA	What girl?
CARTER	The young girl. Who pulled her?
GLENDA	I don't know.
CARTER	Was it Albert?
GLENDA	Shouldn't think so.
CARTER	Is it one of Kinnear's films?
GLENDA	Yeah.
CARTER	Who set it up?  Eric?
GLENDA	Yeah.
CARTER	Then he must have pulled her.
GLENDA	Expect so.
CARTER	Did my brother Frank find out?
GLENDA	Your brother? What you talking about?

CARTER	Now tell me the truth.
GLENDA	The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
CARTER	And you didn't know her last name?
GLENDA	No.
CARTER	Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.

EDDIE	We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
CARTER	Nice of you to come.
EDDIE	No. Frank was a good bloke.

EDDIE	It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
CARTER	Yeah. A bloody funny thing!

CARTER	Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
EDDIE	Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
CARTER	Have another?
EDDIE	No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.

CARTER	Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
EDDIE	No. It's all right.
CARTER	Thanks for coming.
EDDIE	Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.

CARTER	Sorry about your father.
DOREEN	Yeah.
CARTER	Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
DOREEN	They said he was drunk.

CARTER	How's school?
DOREEN	I left last year.
CARTER	Oh, what you doing now?
DOREEN	Working at Woolworths.
CARTER	That must be interesting.
DOREEN	Yes.

CARTER	You all right now?
DOREEN	Yeah.
CARTER	You coming to South America?
DOREEN	No.

CARTER	Where you going to live, then?
DOREEN	At me friend's house.
CARTER	Where's that?
DOREEN	Wilton Estate.
CARTER	Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?

CARTER	Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
DOREEN	Thanks.

KEITH	I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
CARTER	What?
KEITH	I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
CARTER	Did you work with him, Keith?
KEITH	At the Half Moon.

KEITH	I mean, what for?
CARTER	That's what I was wondering.
KEITH	Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
CARTER	Why would it?
KEITH	It just would. He was always the same.
CARTER	Since when did he drink whisky?
KEITH	Don't know.
CARTER	Nobody seems to know.

CARTER	You work here, Keith?
KEITH	Yes.

CARTER	Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
KEITH	Right.
CARTER	I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
KEITH	Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
CARTER	Where would I find him?
KEITH	Today? At the races. He always goes.

KEITH	How'd you know Albert?
CARTER	Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.

KEITH	What you having, Jack?
CARTER	Large Scotch.

KEITH	Heard of a man called Thorpe?
CARTER	Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
KEITH	That's what he was saying about you.

KEITH	Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
CARTER	That's nice. What'd you tell him?
KEITH	Nowt.
CARTER	Good lad.

CARTER	See you later.
KEITH	Where you off to?
CARTER	Las Vegas.

KEITH	Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
CARTER	How many?
KEITH	Four of them.

CARTER	Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
KEITH	Who's Brumby?
CARTER	Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?

CARTER	Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
KEITH	Yeah.
CARTER	Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?

CARTER	What happened to you, then?
KEITH	How'd you find me?

CARTER	Did they give you a rough time?
KEITH	No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
CARTER	No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
KEITH	Get knotted.
CARTER	All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
KEITH	Oh yes? How?

KEITH	Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
CARTER	I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.

CARTER	I won't be using the room tonight.
EDNA	I see.
CARTER	I'm staying with a friend.
EDNA	Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
CARTER	It's not like that, luv.
EDNA	It never is.

EDNA	Are you a traveller?
CARTER	Definitely.
EDNA	Will this do?
CARTER	Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
EDNA	Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
CARTER	You sure?

EDNA	Ta.
CARTER	I'll bet this one's seen some action.

EDNA	What is it?
CARTER	My brother, Frank.
EDNA	Is he staying the night?
CARTER	Funny.  Can I phone London?
EDNA	It'll cost you.

EDNA	What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
CARTER	I'm sorry.
EDNA	You don't look it.
CARTER	No. Really, I am.
EDNA	Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?

EDNA	Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
CARTER	Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.

EDNA	And what you going to do?
CARTER	Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
EDNA	I'll call the police.
CARTER	No, you won't.

EDNA	Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
CARTER	Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
EDNA	Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.

EDNA	Now just a minute...
CARTER	Ta-ra.

EDNA	You sod.
CARTER	They came back?
EDNA	No.

EDNA	What'll they do to him?
CARTER	Don't ask me.

EDNA	They bloody hurt me.
CARTER	You're lucky. They kill as well.
EDNA	And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?

EDNA	Thorpey nearly died laughing.
CARTER	That little shit!
EDNA	What about Keith?
CARTER	What about Keith?
EDNA	What you going to do?
CARTER	Pension him off.
EDNA	You're a bastard.
CARTER	What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?

CARTER	So shut up.
EDNA	What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
CARTER	You wouldn't.
EDNA	How'd you know I wouldn't?
CARTER	'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
EDNA	What's that supposed to mean?
CARTER	Think about it.

EDNA	Are you awake?
CARTER	No.
EDNA	Do you want breakfast?
CARTER	You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
EDNA	Uh-huh.

EDNA	Did you sleep well?
CARTER	Yes, thank you.

CARTER	Are you tired?
EDNA	No. Are you tired?
CARTER	No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?

CARTER	Do us a favour?
EDNA	What, and get myself beaten up again?
CARTER	No chance of that.
EDNA	Not much.
CARTER	They're friends of mine.
EDNA	And that'll make me feel better?
CARTER	I don't want to get rough, do I?

EDNA	What you going to do?
CARTER	I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.

EDNA	You coming back?
CARTER	How could I stay away?

CARTER	Is he?
ERIC	Jack Carter.
CARTER	Eric. Eric Paice.
ERIC	What you doing around here then?
CARTER	Didn't you know this is my home town?
ERIC	No, I didn't know that.
CARTER	Funny, that.

ERIC	Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
CARTER	No. I'm visiting relatives.
ERIC	Oh, that's nice.
CARTER	It would be. If they were still living.
ERIC	Meaning what?
CARTER	A bereavement. A death in the family.
ERIC	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
CARTER	That's all right, Eric.

ERIC	Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
CARTER	Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
ERIC	Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
CARTER	What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
ERIC	Oh, you've been watching television.
CARTER	Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

ERIC	What's it to you anyway?
CARTER	I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
ERIC	That's not always a healthy way to be...
CARTER	And you should know, if I remember rightly.

CARTER	So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
ERIC	Making a living.
CARTER	Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.

CARTER	They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
ERIC	Still got a sense of humour?
CARTER	Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
ERIC	Can't say I do.

ERIC	Jack! I didn't like that.
CARTER	You should have told me who you were working for.
ERIC	Cyril didn't like it, either.
CARTER	Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
ERIC	He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.

ERIC	You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
CARTER	Not till I'm dead, Eric.

CARTER	You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
ERIC	Sod off.

CARTER	Eh? Have a drink.
ERIC	Still got your sense of humour.

CARTER	Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
KINNEAR	Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
CARTER	Scotch, please.
KINNEAR	Piss off, Ray.

KINNEAR	Eric told me of your bereavement.
CARTER	Yep.
KINNEAR	Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
CARTER	No? Funny that. Neither did I.
KINNEAR	If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
CARTER	Yeah.
KINNEAR	Nasty way to go.
CARTER	Yes.

KINNEAR	Not going, Jack?
CARTER	I have to. Things to see to.
KINNEAR	Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
CARTER	Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

CON	Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
PETER	We've got to take you back to London.
CON	He said it'd be doing him a big favour.

CON	We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
PETER	But they have to be diplomatic.

CON	Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
PETER	The gun he means.

CON	Gerald wants to see him first.
PETER	Shut up.

GERALD	Bollock naked with his socks still on?
SID	They do that up North.
GERALD	What for? Protective purposes?

SID	Ask me?
GERALD	Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.

GERALD	Not suede boots!
SID	Knock it off, Gerald.
GERALD	What? And get the clap?

HARRY	Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
KINNEAR	Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?

KINNEAR	Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
HARRY	You're bluffing, you bastard!
KINNEAR	That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?

HARRY	What's that? A hundred?
KINNEAR	That's right, Harry.
HARRY	Your hundred, and another hundred.

HARRY	What's that?
KINNEAR	That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
HARRY	Three hundred altogether?
KINNEAR	Three hundred altogether, Harry.

HARRY	All right. Two hundred.
KINNEAR	Ha.

HARRY	What's that?
KINNEAR	That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.

HARRY	Four hundred?
KINNEAR	That's right.
HARRY	You're not seeing me?
KINNEAR	No.

HARRY	I'll see you, then.
KINNEAR	Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?

KINNEAR	How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
HARRY	Shut up.

AGENT BOB	Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
AGENT RAY	Now that's cool.
AGENT BOB	Cool?
AGENT RAY	Yeah, cool.
AGENT BOB	You think it's cool?
AGENT RAY	It's cool!
AGENT BOB	It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!

AGENT RAY	Secret Service!
AGENT BOB	Don't move!

GILL	How's it going, Ray?
AGENT RAY	It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
GILL	In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
AGENT RAY	I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
GILL	Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
AGENT RAY	Alright sir.

RAZOR	Welcome to our show!
BLADE	Hack the Planet!

BLADE	As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
RAZOR	Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
BLADE	And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
RAZOR	...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
BLADE	Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!

BLADE	Let's keep her.
RAZOR	Waste the dude.

RAZOR	She's rabid, but cute.
BLADE	See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.

BLADE	That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
RAZOR	Hackers of the World, Unite!
BLADE	How are you going to take care of the cops?

CEREAL	What's that?
DADE	Devil book. The Unix Bible.

CEREAL	What's that?
DADE	Dragon book. Compiler design.

CEREAL	Oh yeah? What's that?
DADE	The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.

DADE	Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
CEREAL	Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

CEREAL	So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
DADE	What is it with this guy?

DADE	Shit!
CEREAL	Shh!
DADE	Was that her top?

CEREAL	Right.
DADE	The sensitive type.

DADE	I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
CEREAL	Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.

DADE	What?
CEREAL	Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.

CEREAL	Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
NIKON	Again?  Yeah sure.

CEREAL	Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
NIKON	I want it.

NIKON	Very impressive.
CEREAL	Super hero like even.

CEREAL	Hold on a second!
NIKON	Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
CEREAL	Looks like a hacker wrote it.

CEREAL	Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
NIKON	Yo, man, you an amateur, man.

NIKON	Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
CEREAL	That's far out!
NIKON	This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!

CEREAL	Ta-da!
NIKON	Yo, brain dead, the manual!

CEREAL	Snoop onto them...
NIKON	...as they snoop onto us.

NIKON	Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
CEREAL	Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?

NIKON	Damn!
CEREAL	A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

CEREAL	...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
PHREAK	Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.

PHREAK	What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
CEREAL	Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.

CEREAL	Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
PHREAK	Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
CEREAL	Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
PHREAK	Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?

PHREAK	Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
CEREAL	It was him, man!
PHREAK	You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
CEREAL	I'm gonna hit you!

PHREAK	His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
CEREAL	Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
PHREAK	Do you think he could hack a Gibson?

PHREAK	I want it to have my children!
CEREAL	Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
PHREAK	Yo, hit the lights.

PHREAK	One-handed!
CEREAL	Difficulty rating?

CEREAL	Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
KATE	Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.

CEREAL	Oh wow, we are fried.
KATE	Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
CEREAL	You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.

CEREAL	Well this hasn't happened yet.
KATE	Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!

CEREAL	Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
KATE	Cereal.
CEREAL	Yeah?
KATE	Go fix the phones.
CEREAL	Roger.

DADE	Who's that?
PHREAK	Curtis.
DADE	And what's he do?
PHREAK	That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.

DADE	You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
PHREAK	No, don't know who he is.  Do you?

DADE	Did you talk to him?
PHREAK	Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?

PHREAK	Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
DADE	Yeah? Display?

DADE	Dead.
PHREAK	Dead?
DADE	Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.

PHREAK	Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
DADE	Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.

MRS. MURPHY	Dade?
DADE	Yeah, mom?
MRS. MURPHY	What are you doing?
DADE	I'm taking over a TV network.
MRS. MURPHY	Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.

MRS. MURPHY	Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
DADE	Mm-hmm.
MRS. MURPHY	Up all night again, huh?
DADE	Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?

MRS. MURPHY	Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
DADE	Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
MRS. MURPHY	You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
DADE	Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

MRS. MURPHY	How was school?
DADE	Hmmm.
MRS. MURPHY	What did we learn in school today?
DADE	Revenge.
MRS. MURPHY	Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
DADE	No. No one special.
MRS. MURPHY	Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?

DADE	Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
MRS. MURPHY	And unpack.

PLAGUE	Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
DADE	I'm sorry. Who are you?
PLAGUE	I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
DADE	Nah. I don't play well with others.

DADE	Shit! Come on!
PLAGUE	Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.

PLAGUE	I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
DADE	Blow me.
PLAGUE	Thank you!

PLAGUE	The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
DADE	I told you, I don't play well with others.
PLAGUE	Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.

PLAGUE	Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
DADE	That's bullshit.
PLAGUE	What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
DADE	You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
PLAGUE	Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!

PLAGUE	Talk to me.
DADE	I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
PLAGUE	Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

PLAGUE	Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
DADE	Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
PLAGUE	Give it up! Just give it up.

DADE	I found it! I found it!
PLAGUE	This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!

DADE	Crash Override.
NIKON	Never heard of you. Done anything?
DADE	No.

NIKON	Yo, showtime, showtime!
DADE	What's going on?

NIKON	That's Razor and Blade.
DADE	Razor and Blade.

NIKON	Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
DADE	How did you know that?
NIKON	I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!

NIKON	Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
DADE	Burn!

DADE	This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
NIKON	What's this one eat?
DADE	It nibbles. You see this?

NIKON	Two days.
DADE	And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...

NIKON	They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
DADE	Fucked if I care, man.
NIKON	Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.

NIKON	Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
DADE	Okay. Let's go shopping.

DADE	Oh, shit! He got me.
NIKON	Joey's getting stupid busy.

NIKON	Yes!
DADE	We did it!

KATE	Here's your class.
DADE	My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
KATE	No, you're not in my class.

KATE	Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
DADE	Yeah! Sure.

DADE	That's a nice score for a girl.
KATE	Think you can do better?
DADE	I'll give it a shot.

KATE	What the hell is going on?
DADE	Pool on the roof must have a leak.

KATE	He's not in this class.
DADE	I said give me time.
KATE	He's not enrolled in this class.

DADE	Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
KATE	What?
DADE	I'm Crash Override.
KATE	You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

KATE	What the hell are you doing?
DADE	It's cool, I'm just looking.
KATE	It's too much machine for you.
DADE	Yeah?

DADE	It has a killer refresh rate.
KATE	P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
DADE	Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
KATE	Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
DADE	Yeah. RISC is good.

DADE	You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
KATE	Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
DADE	Yeah.
KATE	Are you challenging me?
DADE	Name your stakes.
KATE	If I win, you become my slave.
DADE	Your slave?
KATE	You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
DADE	And if I win?
KATE	Make it my first born.
DADE	Make it our first date.
KATE	You're not gonna win.
DADE	And you have to smile.
KATE	I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.

KATE	We need your help.
DADE	Do my ears deceive me?

KATE	What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
DADE	I'm sorry, I can't.
KATE	Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?

KATE	Thank you.
DADE	Okay. I'll copy it.
KATE	Okay, thank you.

DADE	Kate, listen.
KATE	Uh, hold on...
DADE	I have to tell you something.

DADE	This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
KATE	The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
DADE	And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
KATE	Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
DADE	Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
KATE	Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

KATE	Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
DADE	I know, I know who wrote it.
KATE	What?
DADE	This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
KATE	You what?
DADE	I didn't know what was on it.

KATE	Why did he come to you?
DADE	I got a record. I was Zero Cool.

KATE	Well that's great. There goes MIT.
DADE	I'll make it up to you!
KATE	How?
DADE	I'll hack the Gibson.

DADE	Shit!!
KATE	It's my subway defense system.

KATE	Alright, so what have we got?
DADE	Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

KATE	There they are!
DADE	Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
KATE	They're elite! Let's get 'em.

KATE	A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
DADE	It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
KATE	We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.

KATE	Ready?
DADE	Yeah.
KATE	Alright, let's boot up.

KATE	It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
DADE	Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.

KATE	Are you crazy? What are you doing?
DADE	I'm trying to help you.

KATE	Dade.
DADE	What?
KATE	Thanks for your help.

KATE	Oh, wow, she's great.
DADE	Yeah.

DADE	You look good in a dress.
KATE	You would have looked better.
DADE	Wanna go for a swim?

KATE	I can't believe they decided you won.
DADE	They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
KATE	Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.

DADE	You know, I've been having these really weird..
KATE	Dreams?

NORM	Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
DADE	Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
NORM	Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
DADE	Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
NORM	Uhhh.. ahahaha...
DADE	Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
NORM	Uhhhmm...
DADE	It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
NORM	212-555-4240.

DADE	Excuse me.
KID	Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
DADE	Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
KID	Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

KID	So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
DADE	Homicidal?
KID	What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

GILL	Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
PLAGUE	No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
GILL	Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.

PLAGUE	Gill.
GILL	I think we've got something.

GILL	It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
PLAGUE	Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
GILL	However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
PLAGUE	Gill.

PLAGUE	Hello?
GILL	We caught 'em.
PLAGUE	Good.
GILL	Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.

GILL	You're welcome.
PLAGUE	What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!

HAL	There's a new virus in the database.
MARGO	What's happening?
HAL	It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?

HAL	A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
MARGO	Cancer?

MARGO	Colonel who?
HAL	The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
MARGO	Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?

HAL	Mr. Belford?
PLAGUE	My name is the Plague.
HAL	Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
PLAGUE	As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
HAL	Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.

PLAGUE	Never fear. I is here.
HAL	I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
PLAGUE	Let's echo 23, see what's up.

HAL	We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
PLAGUE	Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!

PLAGUE	Die, dickweeds!
HAL	The rabbit is in the administration system.

JOEY	Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
PHREAK	Joey, Joey...
JOEY	What? whatwhatwhat?
PHREAK	One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...

JOEY	I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
PHREAK	You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.

JOEY	Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
PHREAK	You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

JOEY	Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
PHREAK	D'you bring those Crayola books?

JOEY	You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
PHREAK	Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
JOEY	Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?

PHREAK	Yo, what's up?
JOEY	Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
PHREAK	Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
JOEY	Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
PHREAK	Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
JOEY	I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?

KATE	Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
PHREAK	I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!

KATE	What is he doing in here?
PHREAK	Relax, Burn, he's my guest.

PHREAK	Any questions?
KATE	Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

KATE	Hello?
PHREAK	Hey, it's me.
KATE	Phreak?
PHREAK	I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
KATE	You think they're going to bust us?
PHREAK	Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?

MARGO	Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
PLAGUE	Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
MARGO	Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
PLAGUE	Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?

PLAGUE	A hacker planted the virus.
MARGO	Virus?
PLAGUE	Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
MARGO	Excuse me?
PLAGUE	The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
MARGO	What, it left a note?

MARGO	So what are we supposed to do?
PLAGUE	Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

MARGO	What the hell was that all about?
PLAGUE	I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
MARGO	What?
PLAGUE	I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
MARGO	I don't want to go to jail for this.
PLAGUE	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
MARGO	But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
PLAGUE	Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
MARGO	Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
PLAGUE	Sh, sh sh sh sh.

MARGO	Murphy kid turn you down?
PLAGUE	I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
MARGO	Pervert! What are you talking about?

PLAGUE	The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
MARGO	Congratulations.
PLAGUE	From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
MARGO	So?
PLAGUE	So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

MARGO	They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
PLAGUE	Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
MARGO	You said the worm was untreaceable!
PLAGUE	Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
MARGO	Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
PLAGUE	No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.

MARGO	What is it? What's wrong?
PLAGUE	Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
MARGO	Minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.

PLAGUE	Send a Flu-shot.
MARGO	Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.

OPERATOR	Thank you.
PHREAK	Nonono, thank YOU!

OPERATOR	Hello, operator services.
PHREAK	Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
OPERATOR	What number please?
PHREAK	555-4202.
OPERATOR	Just one moment.
PHREAK	Thank you.

BEDSOE	What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE	No joke, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE	Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
BEDSOE	If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?

ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
BEDSOE	Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE	You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.

JENNIFER	Lieutenant Bedsoe?
BEDSOE	Not now.  I'm busy.

JENNIFER	Lieutenant?
BEDSOE	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
BEDSOE	Talk to me about what?

BEDSOE	What do you think?
JENNIFER	They appear to be authentic.
BEDSOE	Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
JENNIFER	Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.

BEDSOE	You didn't see this.  Understand?
JENNIFER	Yes.

BEDSOE	Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
DETECTIVE GRELEY	Yeah -- how'd you know that?

DETECTIVE GRELEY	Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
BEDSOE	What is it?
DETECTIVE GRELEY	A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
BEDSOE	Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
DETECTIVE GRELEY	The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.

DETECTIVE GRELEY	That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
BEDSOE	I'd like you to see this.

BEDSOE	Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
DETECTIVE GRELEY	Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
BEDSOE	Tough.
DETECTIVE GRELEY	It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE	This ties in with Nash.
DETECTIVE GRELEY	We don't have any proof of that.
BEDSOE	I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.

BEDSOE	Anything from the bank?
DETECTIVE GRELEY	We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
BEDSOE	He had to come from somewhere.
DETECTIVE GRELEY	I think it was England.
BEDSOE	Why?

DETECTIVE GRELEY	I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
BEDSOE	So?

BEDSOE	I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
CAPTAIN	Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
BEDSOE	What?
CAPTAIN	Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
BEDSOE	You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
CAPTAIN	It's circumstantial.

BEDSOE	For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
CAPTAIN	I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.

MCCLEOD	Detective Bedsoe.
BEDSOE	Lieutenant.
MCCLEOD	Congratulations.

BEDSOE	When did you get back?
MCCLEOD	A few days ago.
BEDSOE	That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.

BEDSOE	Where were you last night around nine?
MCCLEOD	I already told you.  I took a walk.
BEDSOE	Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
MCCLEOD	Central Park.
BEDSOE	Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
MCCLEOD	No.  I don't scare easy.
BEDSOE	Where have you been for the last seven years?
MCCLEOD	Around.
BEDSOE	And Brenda?

BEDSOE	She was a good woman.
MCCLEOD	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
BEDSOE	No.

BEDSOE	I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
MCCLEOD	No.
BEDSOE	You sure?
MCCLEOD	He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.

BEDSOE	I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
MCCLEOD	Is that it?

BEDSOE	No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
MCCLEOD	Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
BEDSOE	Get outta here.

MCCLEOD	Good evening, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE	No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
MCCLEOD	I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
BEDSOE	That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
MCCLEOD	It's late.

BEDSOE	Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
MCCLEOD	Maybe he was a lousy shot.

BEDSOE	Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
MCCLEOD	Most people are afraid of death.

MCCLEOD	Yes -- I think it is.
BEDSOE	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?

CAVANAUGH	You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
MCCLEOD	Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
CAVANAUGH	Caution shows wisdom.

CAVANAUGH	I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
MCCLEOD	Aye.

CAVANAUGH	You?
MCCLEOD	No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
CAVANAUGH	We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
MCCLEOD	Who are you?
CAVANAUGH	Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
MCCLEOD	I learned my fill from Romeriz.
CAVANAUGH	Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.

MCCLEOD	The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
CAVANAUGH	There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
MCCLEOD	The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
CAVANAUGH	Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.

CAVANAUGH	You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
MCCLEOD	Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.

MCCLEOD	Must you do that?
CAVANAUGH	What?
MCCLEOD	Sing.
CAVANAUGH	It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
MCCLEOD	Can't you enjoy it quietly?
CAVANAUGH	Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
MCCLEOD	You?

CAVANAUGH	Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
MCCLEOD	I hear you.
CAVANAUGH	What else?  What else do you hear right now?

MCCLEOD	The river.
CAVANAUGH	That's all?
MCCLEOD	Yes.

CAVANAUGH	Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
MCCLEOD	That is what bothers me.
CAVANAUGH	I see.  You don't care about life anymore.

MCCLEOD	I'm leaving.
CAVANAUGH	Leaving what?
MCCLEOD	England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
CAVANAUGH	And what do you think you will find in another land?
MCCLEOD	Maybe myself.
CAVANAUGH	Then it's worth the journey.

MCCLEOD	Thank you, Thomas.
CAVANAUGH	For what?

MCCLEOD	For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
CAVANAUGH	I'm sure they will.
MCCLEOD	As friends -- always as friends.
CAVANAUGH	We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
MCCLEOD	That is a thought that doesn't please me.
CAVANAUGH	If it came down to it what would you do?
MCCLEOD	I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.

MCCLEOD	You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
CAVANAUGH	The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
MCCLEOD	France.
CAVANAUGH	How long is the voyage?
MCCLEOD	Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
CAVANAUGH	Me?  Of course.

CAVANAUGH	What are we doing here?
MCCLEOD	Living.  Remember?
CAVANAUGH	You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.

MCCLEOD	To ask her to dance.
CAVANAUGH	She's the King's cousin.
MCCLEOD	Then she should be an excellent dancer.

CAVANAUGH	Yes.
MCCLEOD	What worries you?
CAVANAUGH	You.

CAVANAUGH	You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
MCCLEOD	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
CAVANAUGH	So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.

CAVANAUGH	That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
MCCLEOD	No.  What am I to do?
CAVANAUGH	The only thing you can do.  You must end it.

CAVANAUGH	Well?
MCCLEOD	It's done.

CAVANAUGH	I'll go first.
MCCLEOD	No -- I will.
CAVANAUGH	I stood up first.
MCCLEOD	That doesn't matter.
CAVANAUGH	You always get to go first.

MCCLEOD	You can go first.
CAVANAUGH	No -- after you.

FARMER	It will be a good harvest this year.
MCCLEOD	Can you really tell from doing that?
FARMER	What do you think?
MCCLEOD	I think you just like to eat dirt.

FARMER	I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
MCCLEOD	She's a treasure she is.
FARMER	She'll soon be of age.

MCCLEOD	Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
FARMER	I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?

FARMER	This cannot be.
MCCLEOD	It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
FARMER	Agreed.
MCCLEOD	I would like to say goodbye.
FARMER	How?

VIEIRA	How comes it your are not afraid?
HOODED MAN	Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?

HOODED MAN	I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
VIEIRA	And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
HOODED MAN	Your life.
VIEIRA	How?

VIEIRA	We had a bargain.  You promised.
HOODED MAN	I lied.

MCCLEOD	Aye?
ISABELLE	Where do you go when your mind drifts?
MCCLEOD	Different places.
ISABELLE	The past?
MCCLEOD	Sometimes.
ISABELLE	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
MCCLEOD	Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.

MCCLEOD	I cannot stay.
ISABELLE	Why not?
MCCLEOD	I'm leaving in the morning.

ISABELLE	Leaving?  For how long?
MCCLEOD	You'll no see me again.

ISABELLE	Why?
MCCLEOD	I cannot explain.
ISABELLE	Do you love me, Conner?
MCCLEOD	Aye.
ISABELLE	Then take me with you.
MCCLEOD	Where I'm going you cannot follow.
ISABELLE	Why are you doing this?
MCCLEOD	Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.

JENNIFER	Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
REPORTER	Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
JENNIFER	Huge.
REPORTER	What are you hoping to find inside?

JENNIFER	You guys are from the British museum, right?
REPORTER	No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
JENNIFER	Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.

JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
MCCLEOD	I remember you.
JENNIFER	I was wondering if I could talk to you?
MCCLEOD	Are you a cop?
JENNIFER	No.  I'm an archaeologist.
MCCLEOD	What do you want?
JENNIFER	To talk to you.
MCCLEOD	I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.

MCCLEOD	Corpses?
JENNIFER	Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
MCCLEOD	In the highlands?

JENNIFER	Yes.  How did you know?
MCCLEOD	A lucky guess.
JENNIFER	I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
MCCLEOD	He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
JENNIFER	Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
MCCLEOD	You got me.
JENNIFER	Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
MCCLEOD	Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
JENNIFER	If it's good advice.
MCCLEOD	This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
JENNIFER	Why?  What's going on?

MCCLEOD	Where did you get it?
JENNIFER	It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.

JENNIFER	You're hurt.
MCCLEOD	I'll be fine.
JENNIFER	What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
MCCLEOD	Because it's my name.
JENNIFER	Then who's Russell Nash?
MCCLEOD	I don't know anymore.

MCCLEOD	You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
JENNIFER	Jennifer.

JENNIFER	Why do you stare at me like that?
MCCLEOD	You remind me of someone I used to know.

MCCLEOD	I don't have any answers for you.
JENNIFER	Who was that man last night?
MCCLEOD	I don't know.
JENNIFER	Then how did he know your name?

JENNIFER	Do you always walk around with a sword?
MCCLEOD	New York is dangerous place.
JENNIFER	You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
MCCLEOD	About what?
JENNIFER	It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
MCCLEOD	I'm interested in mythology.
JENNIFER	Have you ever heard of the Calan?

MCCLEOD	No.
JENNIFER	You look like you have.

JENNIFER	Yes.
MCCLEOD	Meet me Tratino's at nine.
JENNIFER	Why?
MCCLEOD	I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.

MCCLEOD	Good evening.
JENNIFER	You're twenty minutes late.
MCCLEOD	Sorry.

JENNIFER	You didn't answer my question.
MCCLEOD	I know.

JENNIFER	You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
MCCLEOD	Why?

JENNIFER	I'm just trying to place you.
MCCLEOD	I've lived all over the world.

JENNIFER	You're not an easy person to get to know.
MCCLEOD	Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
JENNIFER	How come you wanted to meet tonight?
MCCLEOD	I wanted to get to know you better.

MCCLEOD	That makes you uncomfortable?
JENNIFER	A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
MCCLEOD	Is it?
JENNIFER	Yes -- it is.
MCCLEOD	Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
JENNIFER	--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
MCCLEOD	Why don't you tell me.

MCCLEOD	Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
JENNIFER	No.
MCCLEOD	Why not?
JENNIFER	Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
MCCLEOD	You don't really believe this do you?

JENNIFER	Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
MCCLEOD	So?
JENNIFER	Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
MCCLEOD	If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
JENNIFER	Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?

MCCLEOD	That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
JENNIFER	--for three hundred years.
MCCLEOD	How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
JENNIFER	Not unless they're immortal.

JENNIFER	Would you like to see it?
MCCLEOD	I've seen it.
JENNIFER	On the back it has--
MCCLEOD	--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
JENNIFER	How did you know that?

MCCLEOD	It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
JENNIFER	You?

MCCLEOD	You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
JENNIFER	And the other one -- he is like you?
MCCLEOD	He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.

JENNIFER	Where will you go now?
MCCLEOD	It will end tonight.
JENNIFER	Must you fight him?
MCCLEOD	He will not stop until it is over.

JENNIFER	He's in there!
MCCLEOD	Get out.

JENNIFER	Be careful, Conner.
MCCLEOD	Conner?

JENNIFER	What now?
MCCLEOD	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
JENNIFER	Sounds very -- normal.

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
JENNIFER	Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
JENNIFER	Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.

JENNIFER	We're holding the workers down below.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Why?
JENNIFER	Someone broke into the cavern last night.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What?  How?

JENNIFER	He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	How could they get by him?
JENNIFER	I don't know.

JENNIFER	We found him this morning.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What's that next to him?
JENNIFER	His head.  Someone cut it off.

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
JENNIFER	I don't think it is a duplication.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	It has to be.
JENNIFER	And this?

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	You stayed here again last night?
JENNIFER	I was working on the cataloging.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
JENNIFER	I know, Paul.

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
JENNIFER	I like my work.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
JENNIFER	We'll see.

KILVARA	It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
OLD MAN	It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?

KILVARA	Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
OLD MAN	I do not know -- and even if I did...
KILVARA	I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.

KILVARA	Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
OLD MAN	It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
KILVARA	Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.

KILVARA	Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
MCCLEOD	This cannot be.

KILVARA	I am stronger than you, Highlander.
MCCLEOD	That's what the Kurgan said.
KILVARA	The Kurgan was a pussy.

KILVARA	Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
MCCLEOD	Why did you wait?
KILVARA	It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
MCCLEOD	It will not end tonight.
KILVARA	You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.

RACHEL	You know it's not safe here for you.
MACLEOD	I know.
RACHEL	The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
MACLEOD	I can take care of myself.

RACHEL	It isn't over, is it, Conner?
MACLEOD	No.
RACHEL	How can that be?
MACLEOD	I don't know.

RACHEL	Is there anything else you need?
MACLEOD	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.

RACHEL	I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
MACLEOD	Me too.

SARAH	Would you care for some water, Conner?
MCCLEOD	Aye -- that I would, lass.

SARAH	Don't leave us, Conner.
MCCLEOD	It's not for me to decide.

MCCLEOD	Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
SARAH	I love you, Conner.
MCCLEOD	Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
SARAH	I'll no forget you.
MCCLEOD	And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.

MCCLEOD	You kept it?
RACHEL	Yes.

RACHEL	What are you doing?
MCCLEOD	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
RACHEL	Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
MCCLEOD	Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
RACHEL	Why won't you ever let anyone help you?

RACHEL	I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
MCCLEOD	Fine.
RACHEL	What will you do?
MCCLEOD	There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.

MCCLEOD	I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
RACHEL	Why?
MCCLEOD	I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
RACHEL	You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.

RACHEL	Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
MCCLEOD	My dreams died long ago.
RACHEL	Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
MCCLEOD	I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
RACHEL	And now it's time to come out of the shadows.

MCCLEOD	Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
RACHEL	If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.

TELLER	Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
MR. PARKER	Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
TELLER	Would you like to deposit this in your account?
MR. PARKER	No.  The money, please.
TELLER	This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
MR. PARKER	I can take care of myself.
TELLER	Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.

SHEA	I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
AMY	You say you saw some activity here?

AMY	Damn it.
SHEA	What's the matter?
AMY	These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...

SHEA	Did you find something?
AMY	I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.

AMY	It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
SHEA	What was her name?
AMY	Colleen.

SHEA	So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
AMY	It might have been her mother.
SHEA	We don't have proof of that.
AMY	The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?

AMY	They don't build them like this anymore.
WILL	Suppose not.

AMY	Town records are coming up now.
WILL	What will they tell you?
AMY	I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.

AMY	I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
WILL	Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
AMY	No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.

WILL	How did you meet Dr. Shea?
AMY	There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
WILL	I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
AMY	So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
WILL	Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
AMY	Yes.  It was.

AMY	It looks delicious...
WILL	Why don't you pass me your plate?

AMY	Did you find her?!
WILL	No!

WILL	Are you all right?
AMY	A few years older, perhaps.
WILL	How's your arm?

AMY	It will heal.
WILL	I'm sorry.
AMY	There's no need to be.

AMY	Good-bye.
WILL	Good-bye.

SEAMUS	May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
AMY	That poor little girl.

AMY	Where does this amulet come from?
SEAMUS	It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.

SEAMUS	The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
AMY	By killing them?
SEAMUS	By freeing them.
AMY	I don't understand.
SEAMUS	The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.

AMY	What do these ingredients mean?
SEAMUS	Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...

AUBREY	Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
MAURA	Sure.

AUBREY	Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
MAURA	Well I bet you they're happy.

AUBREY	Can I do it again tonight?
MAURA	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.

MAURA	Don't play games with me, little girl.
AUBREY	I didn't do anything, mommy.
MAURA	Well then who did?!
AUBREY	Maybe it was Colleen...
MAURA	Who...is Colleen?

AUBREY	It's going to hurt us!
MAURA	No it won't - no it won't!

MAURA	Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
AUBREY	Yes.

MAURA	Can you talk to her?
AUBREY	She talks to me.

AUBREY	She's down...
MAURA	She's down...how do you mean honey?

MAURA	Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
AUBREY	Ok...

MAURA	My angel!
AUBREY	I'm scared!

AUBREY	Are we leaving mommy?
MAURA	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.

AUBREY	Where are we going to go, mommy?
MAURA	We're going to go someplace new.
AUBREY	What about all my other stuff?
MAURA	We'll get it later.

AUBREY	H-how long will it take?
MAURA	Go to your room!  Now!

MAURA	Your father doesn't love us anymore!
AUBREY	What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!

MAURA	Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
AUBREY	I'm ok mommy.

AUBREY	She says she's lonely...
SHEA	Where is she?
AUBREY	She's here.
SHEA	Where is she now?
AUBREY	She's hiding.

AUBREY	She's down.  Help her...
SHEA	Take me to her.

AUBREY	Help me!  Please!!!
SHEA	My God, I heard something!

AUBREY	Can I have this room daddy?
WILL	Sure.  Did you see the others?
AUBREY	I want this one, daddy.
WILL	Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.

AUBREY	What's he doing daddy?
WILL	He's blessing the house.
AUBREY	Why?
WILL	For good luck honey.

AUBREY	Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
WILL	That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
AUBREY	Did you ever see a leprechaun?

AUBREY	Look daddy!  It's empty!
WILL	That's great, honey.

WILL	We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
AUBREY	It's dark!  I can't breathe!

AUBREY	I can't move!
WILL	Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!

AUBREY	Mommy please help me!
WILL	Don't be afraid!
AUBREY	Daddy, please!!!

WILL	Oh my God!  She's in there!
AUBREY	Daddy help!

AUBREY	Are we going back to California daddy?
WILL	Well, that all depends.

WILL	Good night Angel...
AUBREY	Good night daddy.

AUBREY	Mommy!
WILL	Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -

MAURA	I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
WILL	Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...

MAURA	Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
WILL	Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
MAURA	I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
WILL	The place is pretty dusty.
MAURA	Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
WILL	Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
MAURA	Must be...

WILL	What's the matter?
MAURA	Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
WILL	Oh come on...
MAURA	I just, I don't know...
WILL	What will Aubrey think?
MAURA	Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

WILL	Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
MAURA	You didn't think much about that before.
WILL	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.

MAURA	It's just going to take a while.
WILL	Whatever you say.

MAURA	To our family.
WILL	To our family.

MAURA	I wish I knew more about her.
WILL	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
MAURA	Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
WILL	Or what she was worth.

WILL	God rest her soul.
MAURA	I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.

MAURA	Are you playing tricks on me?
WILL	What?
MAURA	It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.

MAURA	What the hell is that?
WILL	I don't know.  That's strange.

WILL	No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
MAURA	She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
WILL	Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...

WILL	...set up some more things.
MAURA	Ok.

WILL	The heater's here.
MAURA	Were you fooling with the power?
WILL	No.
MAURA	Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!

MAURA	What is it?
WILL	It was in the cellar.  Weird.
MAURA	Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -

MAURA	Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
WILL	So what are you saying?
MAURA	I don't know what I'm saying.

MAURA	But do you agree with me?
WILL	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
MAURA	Well what do you think it is?

WILL	Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
MAURA	Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
WILL	There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
MAURA	Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
WILL	Who?
MAURA	I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
WILL	Oh come on!
MAURA	What about keeping an open mind?

WILL	Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
MAURA	Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
WILL	I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.

WILL	It just disappeared.  Literally.
MAURA	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.

WILL	Whoa there...
MAURA	Are you ok?

WILL	What are you talking about?
MAURA	She has a...friend.  Colleen.
WILL	A friend?
MAURA	You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.

MAURA	How are we doing?
WILL	I think everything's ready.
MAURA	Good.  I'll start bringing things in.

MAURA	Oh my God where is she!
MAURA	She's gone!
WILL	Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!

WILL	Aubrey!
MAURA	Aubrey!

WILL	It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
MAURA	You seem to appreciate the local scenery.

MAURA	I'm fine.
WILL	Ok...

WILL	You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
MAURA	Should I...
WILL	No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.

MAURA	You don't think I know?
WILL	Know what?

MAURA	Do you think I'm a fool?
WILL	What?
MAURA	Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
WILL	What are you talking about?

WILL	Maura, what is this!
MAURA	We're not going.
WILL	Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!

MAURA	We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
WILL	No...  NO!

WILL	Maura!
MAURA	What's happening!

WILL	Are you all right?
MAURA	I'm ok.

MAURA	You're bleeding.
WILL	I'm all right...

SHEA	Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
MAURA	Well that's what we're here for. I mean -

MAURA	We don't know.
SHEA	I could see if I detect the presence of something.

MAURA	I think we should do it.
SHEA	We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
MAURA	What do you mean, unfortunately?
SHEA	We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
MAURA	What about the other five percent?

SHEA	Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
MAURA	She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.

MAURA	Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
SHEA	If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.

SHEA	I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
MAURA	Before.

SHEA	You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
MAURA	Maura.
SHEA	Maura.
MAURA	Yeah, they told us this was the best.

SHEA	I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
MAURA	You'll have to settle for turkey.

MAURA	Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
SHEA	White meat will be fine...

SEAMUS	You must be a Londrigan.
MAURA	Yes, I am.

SEAMUS	...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
MAURA	Oh, that's nice...
SEAMUS	May I come in?

SEAMUS	Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
MAURA	Did you know her very well?

SEAMUS	She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
MAURA	It was a shame.
SEAMUS	In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.

MAURA	Well it's nice that you were there for her.
SEAMUS	I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...

SEAMUS	Your daughter's been taken.
MAURA	What!

SEAMUS	I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
MAURA	Why?
SEAMUS	The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -

SEAMUS	Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
MAURA	So what should we do, father?

SEAMUS	Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
MAURA	Aubrey?  It's mommy.

SEAMUS	Concentrate!  She can hear you!
MAURA	Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!

SEAMUS	She's coming back.  Keep talking!
MAURA	Come back to us honey!

SEAMUS	You must be the new tenants.
WILL	And you...are?

SEAMUS	My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
WILL	How can I help you?

WILL	What was she afraid of?
SEAMUS	Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...

WILL	Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
SEAMUS	Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.

SEAMUS	I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
WILL	Thank you.
SEAMUS	Perhaps I'll see you in church.

SEAMUS	Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
WILL	Good night.

WILL	We'll never know for sure.
SEAMUS	Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.

WILL	This isn't happening...
SEAMUS	The amulet...

WILL	What...amulet?
SEAMUS	Did you remove anything in the cellar!

SEAMUS	I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
WILL	So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
SEAMUS	We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
WILL	What are you getting at!
SEAMUS	I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!

WILL	How long will it take!
SEAMUS	It will not take long...

SEAMUS	Keep talking!
WILL	It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...

WILL	The rain is letting up.
SEAMUS	Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
WILL	I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
SEAMUS	I didn't do anything...God saved her...
WILL	What's going to happen?
SEAMUS	I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.

SEAMUS	Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
WILL	Yes, they are.

SEAMUS	Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
WILL	We'll be there.

SHEA	No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
WILL	Oh.

SHEA	Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
WILL	And what would you do?
SHEA	Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.

SHEA	Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
WILL	So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
SHEA	Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.

SHEA	Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
WILL	Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.

SHEA	Where did you find this?
WILL	It was nailed to the cellar wall.
SHEA	I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
WILL	Runic?

SHEA	Do you mind if I borrow it?
WILL	Not at all, if it can help.

SHEA	There's something in there.
WILL	What?
SHEA	There's something through that wall!
WILL	Well what is it!
SHEA	I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!

ANNA	Oh thank God, you're dead...
ALEX	It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...

ALEX	You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
ANNA	Something like that.
ALEX	Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
ANNA	Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...

ANNA	That was beautiful.
ALEX	I laughed, I cried.

ALEX	The security's actually not that severe.
ANNA	It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.

ALEX	Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
ANNA	Gum.

ALEX	Eighth room down, babe...
ANNA	Guards come exactly every three minutes....

ALEX	That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
HAWK	Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
ALEX	Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.

HAWK	Looks like you've been expanding your...
ALEX	Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
HAWK	My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.

HAWK	That's your definition of "Hard?"
ALEX	Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
HAWK	Three minutes, 51 seconds.
ALEX	Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
HAWK	Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
ALEX	Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
HAWK	Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
ALEX	Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?

ALEX	So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
HAWK	Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

ALEX	Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
HAWK	Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....

ALEX	I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
HAWK	I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
ALEX	Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

HAWK	Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
ALEX	Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.

ALEX	Hmmmm.....
HAWK	Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.

HAWK	It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
ALEX	Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

HAWK	The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
ALEX	Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
HAWK	But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
ALEX	Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.

HAWK	This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
ALEX	There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
HAWK	You're not...LISTENING!

HAWK	I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
ALEX	Rutherford Auction... that name...

HAWK	Alex!
ALEX	Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?

HAWK	Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
ALEX	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.

HAWK	Cameras?
ALEX	No need.  Guards' station's right there.

ALEX	They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
HAWK	Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...

ALEX	You got about five minutes and change.
HAWK	5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
ALEX	You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.

ALEX	He kicks up at anything he hears.
L292826	u5951	m394	HAWK	A mule is an animal with long funny ears."

ALEX	He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought.
HAWK	And though he's slippery, he still gets caught.

HAWK	And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo.
ALEX	Every day you meet quite a few.

ALEX	The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
HAWK	What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
ALEX	You could be swinging on a star.
HAWK	Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...

ALEX	Did I miss anything?
HAWK	Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
ALEX	Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?

HAWK	The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
ALEX	Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.

HAWK	Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
ALEX	Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
HAWK	Attempted.  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....

HAWK	Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
ALEX	Why try?
HAWK	Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
ALEX	You re not thinking of going to...
HAWK	Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?

HAWK	You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
ALEX	But I said I was sorry....
HAWK	No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
ALEX	Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

HAWK	Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
ALEX	Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

ALEX	We're going in from the ground floor.
HAWK	Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.





HAWK	Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
L293222	u5951	m394	HAWK	Okay.
L293221	u5943	m394	ALEX	Why not just go now?
L293220	u5951	m394	HAWK	Count of three?
L293214	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
L293213	u5943	m394	ALEX	You sound disappointed.
L293212	u5951	m394	HAWK	Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was Who Shot J.R.?"
ALEX	Maybe we're ragged and funny.

ALEX	Now that's a lock.
HAWK	Don't worry, we'll get it...

HAWK	Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt
ALEX	How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt

HAWK	That was close....
ALEX	Anna, I think you better stay....
HAWK	You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.

ALEX	But we'll be the same as we started...
L293253	u5951	m394	HAWK	We all had our quarrels and parted..."

ALEX	I'm a ghost.  Boo.
HAWK	I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...

HAWK	Alex, are you....
ALEX	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
HAWK	You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...

ALEX	Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
HAWK	Let's just forget it, I mean...
ALEX	Get em....

ALFRED	Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
HAWK	Too-do-loo, babe.

ALFRED	Welcome to Rome, sir.
HAWK	Yes way.

HAWK	My life is not some deal.  I...
ALFRED	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

ALFRED	Welcome back to Vinci.
HAWK	Last rites, sister?

ALFRED	How.
HAWK	You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
ALFRED	My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
HAWK	Ooh-kay...

KAPLAN	Don't you just hate kids...
ALMOND JOY	George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
KAPLAN	I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...

ALMOND JOY	Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
KAPLAN	Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.

ALMOND JOY	With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
KAPLAN	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

ALMOND JOY	Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
KAPLAN	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...

SNICKERS	Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
ALMOND JOY	Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.

SNICKERS	Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
ALMOND JOY	Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
SNICKERS	Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.

SNICKERS	This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
ALMOND JOY	Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...

ALMOND JOY	What the hell....
SNICKERS	You're supposed to be dead!

CARDINAL	Did he mention the Mayflowers?
ANNA	No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
CARDINAL	Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
ANNA	That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
CARDINAL	Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
ANNA	Yeah.  The big E.

CARDINAL	Hit me with your best shot.
ANNA	I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
CARDINAL	Anna, what are you trying to say...
ANNA	He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...

CARDINAL	Messed around messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
ANNA	A little petting is not the issue!
CARDINAL	Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.

ANNA	You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
CARDINAL	Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
ANNA	I'm going to find out.
CARDINAL	I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
ANNA	I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
CARDINAL	God go with you, sister.

HAWK	Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
ANNA	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

ANNA	My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
HAWK	Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
ANNA	No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
HAWK	Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.

ANNA	Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
HAWK	Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

ANNA	Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
HAWK	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

ANNA	As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
HAWK	That's what you theenk.
ANNA	Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.

ANNA	Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
HAWK	Never, why do you ask?

HAWK	Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
ANNA	Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
HAWK	Could you believe that crazy elephant?

HAWK	Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
ANNA	Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
HAWK	The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
ANNA	Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
HAWK	Oh, you read that.
ANNA	Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
HAWK	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
ANNA	I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
HAWK	God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
ANNA	I'll bring my entire repertoire...

HAWK	And I'll bring my entourage...
ANNA	Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
HAWK	Said.

ANNA	Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
HAWK	I never break a date.  Scout's honor.

HAWK	This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
ANNA	Prison?
HAWK	I was the Warden?
ANNA	How long were you in?
HAWK	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
ANNA	Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
HAWK	I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....

ANNA	What have you been doing?
HAWK	Uh....old badminton injury.

HAWK	tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
ANNA	Oh, I'm so sorry...

ANNA	I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
HAWK	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
ANNA	It's also been a long time for me.  I--

HAWK	Catholic girls are scary...
ANNA	Somebody robbed the Vatican.
HAWK	Oh.  No.

HAWK	It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
ANNA	You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
HAWK	Wha--
ANNA	What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

ANNA	For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
HAWK	Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
ANNA	The C.I. what?  God, no...
HAWK	Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...

HAWK	This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
ANNA	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.

ANNA	Hudson, don't you understand...
HAWK	And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
ANNA	I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
HAWK	Oh.  Well, what's this?

ANNA	Where did you get this?
HAWK	You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
ANNA	It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.

HAWK	You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
ANNA	It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
HAWK	Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
ANNA	You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....

HAWK	Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
ANNA	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
HAWK	Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.

ANNA	Oh Hudson...
HAWK	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
ANNA	Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
HAWK	This is too bad to be false.

HAWK	I hope you know what....
ANNA	Trust Leonardo....
HAWK	Wha.....

ANNA	Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
HAWK	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
ANNA	Wha -- you don't want to know...

HAWK	I wanna know...
ANNA	Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.

HAWK	Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
ANNA	Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
HAWK	I got my planet back.

KAPLAN	Way to go, Anna.
ANNA	When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
KAPLAN	And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?

KAPLAN	It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
ANNA	Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
KAPLAN	Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

ANNA	Cat got his tongue?
KAPLAN	Actually he never told us what it was.

CESAR	How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
HAWK	Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...

CESAR	You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
HAWK	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.

CESAR	Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
HAWK	If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.

CESAR	What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
HAWK	Baseball, why?

CESAR	Good job, not pretty, but good.
HAWK	Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?

DARWIN	Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
MINERVA	Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

DARWIN	Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
MINERVA	That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

MINERVA	We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
DARWIN	Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
MINERVA	Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

DARWIN	Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
MINERVA	Like a "cat", one could say.

MINERVA	No, let me!
DARWIN	I don't care.

DARWIN	So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
MINERVA	Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.

DARWIN	Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
MINERVA	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
DARWIN	Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

DARWIN	I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
MINERVA	We're here to say, your government was right.
DARWIN	So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.

MINERVA	I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
DARWIN	That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
MINERVA	Million five, lover...

DARWIN	For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
HAWK	You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
DARWIN	Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.

DARWIN	So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
HAWK	Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
DARWIN	Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
HAWK	If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
DARWIN	Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
HAWK	I guess that's a no.

DARWIN	Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
HAWK	Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....

DARWIN	I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
HAWK	You want an address on that last one?

DARWIN	What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
HAWK	But you're going to tell us anyway...

GATES	Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
HAWK	The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.

GATES	Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
HAWK	What job?

GATES	The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
HAWK	The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

GATES	You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
HAWK	How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."

GATES	Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
HAWK	Yes.
GATES	Remember that shoe you lost...
HAWK	Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

HAWK	What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
GATES	That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.

GATES	Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
HAWK	Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?

GATES	All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
HAWK	You certainly do.
GATES	So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?

HAWK	Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
MINERVA	For God's sake, chain this convict.

HAWK	Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
MINERVA	You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
HAWK	You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.

MINERVA	Get away from there, convict!
HAWK	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

MINERVA	Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
HAWK	Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.

MINERVA	Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
HAWK	Alchemy.

HAWK	Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
MINERVA	Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

HAWK	Bunny, not you too?
MINERVA	You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.

MINERVA	I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
HAWK	If you think you're getting past me...

HAWK	You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
MINERVA	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
HAWK	Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
MINERVA	You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

MINERVA	If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
HAWK	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
MINERVA	I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.

HAWK	This is the worst night...
SNICKERS	When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

HAWK	You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
SNICKERS	Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
HAWK	Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!

HAWK	Don't be stupid...they...
SNICKERS	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
HAWK	Just shut up and hit me!

HAWK	Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
SNICKERS	Too bad.

HAWK	Don't I know you...
KAPLAN	You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
HAWK	Bastard, you're going to need another nose!

HAWK	But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
KAPLAN	I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
HAWK	To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.

KAPLAN	I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
HAWK	Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
KAPLAN	Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
HAWK	Employer?  The president?
KAPLAN	No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
HAWK	I'm supposed to fall for that?
KAPLAN	Shucks.  Guess not.

KAPLAN	Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
HAWK	Why George, you big softie...
KAPLAN	God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.

HAWK	Thanks for sharing.
KAPLAN	We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
HAWK	If you do anything to my friend...
KAPLAN	Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.

HAWK	Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
KAPLAN	They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
HAWK	I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.

KAPLAN	I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
HAWK	No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?

HAWK	Why does this have to be so hard...
KAPLAN	Tell me about it...

AMANDA	ERRR-IIIC!
GRANT	And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.

AMANDA	Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
GRANT	A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?

GRANT	After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
AMANDA	He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.

AMANDA	Eric!
GRANT	Quiet!

AMANDA	This is how you make dinosaurs?
GRANT	This is how you play God.

AMANDA	Do you think it goes all the way across?
GRANT	One way to find out.

GRANT	Oh, my God.
AMANDA	What is it?
GRANT	A bird cage.

PAUL	First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
AMANDA	It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

PAUL	Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
AMANDA	We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.

AMANDA	...once-in-a-lifetime.
PAUL	We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.

PAUL	Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
AMANDA	From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.

PAUL	Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
AMANDA	What?
PAUL	He says it's a bad idea!
AMANDA	What's a bad idea?

AMANDA	We can't just...
PAUL	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.

PAUL	Her new boyfriend.
AMANDA	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
PAUL	We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?

PAUL	Sorry.
AMANDA	Nothing you haven't seen before.

AMANDA	How much weight have you lost?
PAUL	Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
AMANDA	You hate to swim.
PAUL	People change.

PAUL	You look good.
AMANDA	So do you.

PAUL	Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
AMANDA	Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
PAUL	No, Dr. Grant says...
AMANDA	Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
PAUL	Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
AMANDA	Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
PAUL	Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
AMANDA	Oh, don't worry about that.
PAUL	What?
AMANDA	Nothing.
PAUL	What did you say?
AMANDA	Nothing.
PAUL	What did you say!
AMANDA	Just drop it Paul!

PAUL	Young adult.
AMANDA	Eric...

PAUL	That's him. Thats Eric!
AMANDA	I filmed this the morning they left.

PAUL	I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
AMANDA	No, it's...
PAUL	I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
AMANDA	Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

PAUL	Eric! Are you here?
AMANDA	Eric!

PAUL	Udesky.
AMANDA	He's this way.

PAUL	It's not safe.
AMANDA	We have to help him.

AMANDA	We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
PAUL	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?

AMANDA	Well what?
PAUL	Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.

AMANDA	This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
PAUL	That one time was just the bumper.
AMANDA	He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.

PAUL	I don't know. I don't have it with me.
AMANDA	When did you have it last?
PAUL	I don't remember
AMANDA	Think.

AMANDA	What?...WHAT!?
PAUL	I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...

AMANDA	Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
PAUL	Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?

AMANDA	Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
PAUL	We're not going anywhere, I promise.

AMANDA	Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
PAUL	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!

PAUL	My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
AMANDA	You couldn't have made that jump.
PAUL	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
AMANDA	How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
PAUL	He could have died.
AMANDA	But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.

AMANDA	We should try fishing again.
PAUL	You mean it?
AMANDA	I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.

PAUL	Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
AMANDA	I would completely support that.

AMANDA	You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
BILLY	How low?

AMANDA	He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
BILLY	Who's that?

AMANDA	I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
BILLY	Here!

BILLY	He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
AMANDA	He's not a kill, he's still alive.

BILLY	We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
AMANDA	What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
BILLY	Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
AMANDA	What about Eric?

AMANDA	You had the phone the whole time?
BILLY	Where is it?

AMANDA	PAUL!
ERIC	DAD!

ERIC	Where's Dad?
AMANDA	Just hold on.

ERIC	We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
AMANDA	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
ERIC	then we should...

AMANDA	Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
ERIC	He loves you too.
AMANDA	Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

BILLY	That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
PAUL	I didn't know, there were two islands.

BILLY	So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
PAUL	Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
BILLY	About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.

PAUL	They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
BILLY	They set a trap  They actually set a trap.

BILLY	I dont know.
PAUL	I thought you were an expert.
BILLY	Dr. Grant was.

PAUL	He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
BILLY	Sure.

PAUL	Eric!
BILLY	It won't hold!

BILLY	How was your trip? Profitable?
GRANT	We'll be broke in four weeks.
BILLY	Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

GRANT	You rented an automated litter box.
BILLY	It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
GRANT	Not if it can't dig.

GRANT	Absolutely not.
BILLY	They're here.
GRANT	What?

GRANT	Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
BILLY	No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
GRANT	That does sound lucky.
BILLY	It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
GRANT	Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.

BILLY	Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
GRANT	The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.

BILLY	I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
GRANT	Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...

BILLY	Is it a rex?
GRANT	I don't think so.

GRANT	How would you classify it?
BILLY	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
GRANT	They never got that big.
BILLY	Baryonyx?
GRANT	Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
BILLY	I don't remember that on InGen's list.
GRANT	That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?

BILLY	It looks intact.
GRANT	We should take it with us to signal any planes.

BILLY	We could co-write a paper.
GRANT	Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.

BILLY	ALAN!
GRANT	KEEP GOING!

GRANT	We need to keep moving.
BILLY	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
GRANT	Billy, I can't talk to you now.

BILLY	You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
GRANT	Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.

BILLY	I CAN GET HIM!
GRANT	NO!
BILLY	I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

GRANT	Hmm?
ELLIE	He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?

GRANT	He used to know me.
ELLIE	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

ELLIE	So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
GRANT	Really?  What do you do there?

ELLIE	Anything good?
GRANT	Raptors, mostly.
ELLIE	My favorite.

GRANT	You remember the sounds they made?
ELLIE	I try not to.
GRANT	We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
ELLIE	You think they could talk to each other?
GRANT	To a degree we never imagined.

ELLIE	Good luck with the fund raising.
GRANT	It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
ELLIE	Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
GRANT	The last of my breed.

GRANT	I'd better get going.
ELLIE	Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
GRANT	Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
ELLIE	Goodbye, Alan.

ELLIE	When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
GRANT	A well-accepted theory.
ELLIE	Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

GRANT	Eric, your parents are both here.
ERIC	In Costa Rica?
GRANT	On the island.

ERIC	They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
GRANT	You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.

ERIC	You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
GRANT	Which one do you prefer?
ERIC	The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
GRANT	Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

ERIC	When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
GRANT	Any weapons, radios?

ERIC	Found this, but the battery's dead.
GRANT	It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.

ERIC	Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
GRANT	The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.

GRANT	Did you read Malcolm's book?
ERIC	Yeah.
GRANT	What did you think?
ERIC	I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.

ERIC	Know what this is?
GRANT	A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
ERIC	Mine's new.

GRANT	How much of this island have you explored?
ERIC	I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
GRANT	We need to head for the coast.
ERIC	Are you sure?
GRANT	Why?
ERIC	Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.

GRANT	We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
ERIC	Then we go home?

ERIC	Do you have any kids?
GRANT	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

GRANT	I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
ERIC	I want to be an astronaut.
GRANT	See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
ERIC	But then you never get to go in space.
GRANT	Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.

GRANT	Bonitas.
ERIC	Something must've scared them.

ERIC	The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
GRANT	She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.

GRANT	It's strikes me now I never told her that.
ERIC	You should.
GRANT	You're right.

GRANT	Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
ERIC	No. I couldn't see.
GRANT	Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.

ERIC	We're safe!
GRANT	No we're not.

ERIC	What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
GRANT	The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.

GRANT	What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
PAUL	Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
GRANT	You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
PAUL	I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

GRANT	Hmmm.
PAUL	Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...

GRANT	That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
PAUL	No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
GRANT	I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.

GRANT	That's hard to believe.
PAUL	Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.

PAUL	Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
GRANT	This plane can not land!

GRANT	What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
PAUL	Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
GRANT	Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...

PAUL	We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
GRANT	I have never been on this island!
PAUL	Sure you have. You wrote that book...

GRANT	No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
PAUL	Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
GRANT	You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.

GRANT	There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
PAUL	There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.

PAUL	Well that's good.
GRANT	But you never came across just one.

PAUL	Amanda!
GRANT	Back out! Move!

GRANT	Billy!
PAUL	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

PAUL	Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
GRANT	Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
PAUL	Stan.

JACK	Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
BICKERMAN	Oh yes.  I killed him.

JACK	You killed him.
BICKERMAN	Oh, yes.

JACK	He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
BICKERMAN	No.  Do you?

BICKERMAN	You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
JACK	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
BICKERMAN	You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.

BICKERMAN	Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
KEOUGH	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
BICKERMAN	Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.

KEOUGH	And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
BICKERMAN	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.

BICKERMAN	I haven't broken any laws.
KEOUGH	Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
BICKERMAN	The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.

KEOUGH	Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
BICKERMAN	<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

KEOUGH	Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
BICKERMAN	Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.

BICKERMAN	Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
KEOUGH	You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
BICKERMAN	Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.

BICKERMAN	I'll sue you.
KEOUGH	Go ahead.

HECTOR	You're a beautiful woman.
GARE	Thank you.
HECTOR	And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.

GARE	It seems like we're getting lower.
HECTOR	It happens when I land.
GARE	Why are we landing?
HECTOR	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
GARE	<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.

GARE	C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
HECTOR	I need to see his habitat.

GARE	<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
HECTOR	He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.

GARE	I might get a shot.
HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
GARE	Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.

GARE	Go!!!
HECTOR	<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

KEOUGH	--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
HECTOR	I'll need any and all topographic studies.
KEOUGH	Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
HECTOR	I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.

HECTOR	They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
KEOUGH	Mr. Cyr!
HECTOR	C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?

KEOUGH	I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
HECTOR	They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
KEOUGH	And what would he do come winter?
HECTOR	They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?

KEOUGH	Around here.  Yeah.
HECTOR	If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.

KEOUGH	We'd only just met.
HECTOR	Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
KEOUGH	Keystone what?
HECTOR	Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.

KEOUGH	We are here on official business.
HECTOR	Cocktail?
KEOUGH	<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
HECTOR	They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
KEOUGH	Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!

HECTOR	Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
KEOUGH	No!!  Out!

KEOUGH	You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
HECTOR	And you like me.
KEOUGH	I do <u>not</u> like you.
HECTOR	Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.

HECTOR	Jesus Christ!!
KEOUGH	What the hell are you doing?!!
HECTOR	What are <u>you</u> doing?!
KEOUGH	You're crawling around like a--
HECTOR	I'm laying a spring trap!
KEOUGH	A spring trap!
HECTOR	I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
KEOUGH	I coulda shot you, you--
HECTOR	This could end up saving your life,--

KEOUGH	Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
HECTOR	They don't really attack underwater and--
KEOUGH	That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
HECTOR	No crocodile has ever--

KEOUGH	Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
HECTOR	Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.

KEOUGH	Is this a trick?
HECTOR	What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.

KEOUGH	I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
HECTOR	No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.

HECTOR	Was he a good man?
KEOUGH	Yup.
HECTOR	Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.

KEOUGH	His head was just... bitten off.
HECTOR	I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.

HECTOR	This is a setback.
KEOUGH	You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.

HECTOR	Promise you won't kill me, first.
KEOUGH	I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?

KEOUGH	Asia?  How... how could he get here?
HECTOR	Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

HECTOR	Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
KEOUGH	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
HECTOR	<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.

HECTOR	What's that?
KEOUGH	It came from across the lake.

HECTOR	Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
KEOUGH	He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
HECTOR	Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
KEOUGH	I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
HECTOR	That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
KEOUGH	Raincheck.

KEOUGH	I can arrest you!!
HECTOR	Then do it!!
KEOUGH	You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
HECTOR	So profound and fat.

KEOUGH	Gee, that would really disappoint me.
HECTOR	Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.

HECTOR	No!
KEOUGH	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
HECTOR	I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.

KEOUGH	Where is he?!
HECTOR	I don't know!

HECTOR	At school they'd always say "go" first.
JACK	Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
HECTOR	He never said "go".
JACK	Get the gun.

JACK	This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
HECTOR	Bastard bit my chopper.
JACK	Hey!!

HECTOR	Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
JACK	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--

JACK	Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
HECTOR	I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
JACK	<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
HECTOR	Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--

JACK	No way.
HECTOR	Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.

JACK	So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
HECTOR	We both know what they'll do.

JACK	And again.  How would you get him on land?
HECTOR	That's actually the easy part.

JACK	Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
HECTOR	Right.
JACK	The more he thrashes, the better.
HECTOR	You ready on shore?
JACK	We're ready.

HECTOR	I got something on the screen.
JACK	You do?

JACK	Where?  Where?
HECTOR	Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
JACK	Can you confirm visually or just radar?
HECTOR	Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
JACK	Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.

JACK	Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
HECTOR	Thank you, Jack.
JACK	You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?

HECTOR	Where is he?
JACK	Tranq guns down, rifles up!

HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
JACK	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--

JACK	You take care.
HECTOR	You talk to Bickerman?
JACK	She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
HECTOR	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
JACK	Just those two.

KELLY	Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
HECTOR	That hurt my feelings.

HECTOR	If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
KELLY	I never had sex with you!
HECTOR	Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.

KELLY	But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
HECTOR	'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
KELLY	<u>Hector</u>.

KELLY	None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
HECTOR	What's going on?

HECTOR	Such the flirt.
KELLY	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.

KELLY	You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
HECTOR	And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
KELLY	I'm just saying last resort.

HECTOR	Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
KELLY	What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
HECTOR	As if.  Will you miss me?

KELLY	He was an Indo-pacific.
HECTOR	Are you sure?
KELLY	Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.

KELLY	<u>Jack</u>!
HECTOR	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--

KELLY	<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
HECTOR	You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
KELLY	Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
HECTOR	Nothing's real.
KELLY	Excuse me?
HECTOR	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--

HECTOR	With crocodiles... everything's even.
KELLY	I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
HECTOR	I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
KELLY	Oh, bullshit.

HECTOR	Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
KELLY	No.
HECTOR	Eh.  Fuck it.
KELLY	Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
HECTOR	Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...

KELLY	What?
HECTOR	Could we have intercourse?

HECTOR	They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
KELLY	They could try to tranq him on land.
HECTOR	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.

KELLY	And how would we neutralize him?
HECTOR	We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.

HECTOR	I'm okay.
KELLY	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

KELLY	You're gonna be okay.
HECTOR	Guess I finally got bit.
KELLY	Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.

HECTOR	He's gonna live?
KELLY	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
HECTOR	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.

KELLY	Kelly Scott.
JACK	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
KELLY	Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

JACK	Did you make anything of the tooth?
KELLY	Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

KELLY	Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
JACK	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.

KELLY	How big do the bears get?
JACK	Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
KELLY	And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
JACK	Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.

KELLY	It really is beautiful, isn't it?
JACK	Never been to Maine before?
KELLY	I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.

JACK	Why are you here?  Really.
KELLY	I <u>told</u> you.
JACK	The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
KELLY	How would <u>you</u> know, what--
JACK	And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
KELLY	So I don't like tents, why--
JACK	You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--

KELLY	I'm not making it up.
JACK	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
KELLY	I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.

KELLY	Oh my God.
JACK	What?
KELLY	If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
JACK	Who?
KELLY	Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.

JACK	In Maine?
KELLY	There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.

JACK	Same thing from Fish And Game.
KELLY	<u>Something's</u> in that water.
JACK	Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.

JACK	Baby crocs?
KELLY	Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
JACK	If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
KELLY	Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

JACK	He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
KELLY	I'd be able to see something.

JACK	What are you doing?
KELLY	Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

JACK	Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
KELLY	I beg your pardon?
JACK	Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
KELLY	I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
JACK	It's too dangerous for--
KELLY	I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
JACK	You flew up here because your boss--
KELLY	I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--

KELLY	That was an awful thing to say to me.
JACK	I'm sorry but you're...

JACK	Okay.  We're up at six.
KELLY	Good.
JACK	'Night.

JACK	He thinks they're what?
KELLY	In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

KELLY	They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
JACK	Good.  See ya soon.
KELLY	Good luck.

JACK	You okay?  Kelly?
KELLY	Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
JACK	No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
KELLY	That's probably good.
JACK	Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.

JACK	<u>Are</u> you okay?
KELLY	Um... y'know...  Yeah.

KELLY	Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
JACK	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.

JACK	You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
KELLY	Excuse me?
JACK	When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
KELLY	What are you talking about?
JACK	I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
KELLY	Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
JACK	Forgive me for trying to be nice.
KELLY	Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
JACK	I didn't say it like that.
KELLY	You <u>did</u>, you--
JACK	I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
KELLY	A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
JACK	Just forget it.

KELLY	Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
JACK	But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?

JACK	Like little children.  You okay?
KELLY	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
JACK	I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
KELLY	I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
JACK	Let's get away from the shore.

JACK	Sorry.
KELLY	It's okay.

JACK	<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
KELLY	Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
JACK	Who taught you be be a nurse?
KELLY	Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
JACK	No thanks.
KELLY	Keep it dry.  No swimming.
JACK	Thank you.

JACK	You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
KELLY	What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?

JACK	That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
KELLY	Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

JACK	Thanks for the... bandaid.
KELLY	Night.

JACK	Well.  Goodnight.
KELLY	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
JACK	We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...

KELLY	I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
JACK	Ssssh!
KELLY	What?
JACK	I heard something.

KELLY	Thing we can lift it?
JACK	Maybe.  Don't mush it.
KELLY	I'm not mushing it.
JACK	You're mushing it a little around the--
KELLY	<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.

JACK	Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
KELLY	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
JACK	Really--
KELLY	<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
JACK	Calm down.
KELLY	You calm down!
JACK	<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.

KELLY	What?
JACK	Look.

JACK	You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
KELLY	Alright, Jack!
JACK	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--

JACK	Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
KELLY	Okay.
JACK	We might as well pack.
KELLY	Good idea.

JACK	Are we crazy?
KELLY	Well...
JACK	We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.

JACK	It can't work.
KELLY	He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
JACK	He looks like a giant tea bag.

JACK	He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
KELLY	He's floating.  Take it home.
JACK	Hector.

KELLY	He's mooing.
JACK	You wouldn't?

KELLY	Watch out!!
JACK	Keep firing!

KELLY	Hector!!
JACK	Take him.

KELLY	We gotta get to Hector!!
JACK	Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!

KELLY	He's through fighting.  Look at him.
JACK	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

JACK	Get him onto shore.
KELLY	He heeds a tourniquet.

KELLY	Well...
JACK	You wanna ride in my truck?

JACK	You sure?  I don't mind...
KELLY	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.

JACK	If I'm ever in New York...
KELLY	Yeah.

JACK	Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
KELLY	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.

JACK	It was... something meeting you.
KELLY	Likewise.

KELLY	Different worlds, Jack.
JACK	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
KELLY	No.
JACK	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
KELLY	You think?
JACK	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
KELLY	Probably not.

JACK	That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
KELLY	Good thinking.

JACK	We set?
KEOUGH	Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

KEOUGH	I'm ready when you are.
JACK	Let's go.

KEOUGH	Half mile up, there's a clearing.
JACK	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
KEOUGH	I'll call the coroner.

JACK	What's that?
KEOUGH	White perch.
JACK	Are they feeding?
KEOUGH	Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
JACK	They look like they're jumping.

JACK	Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
KEOUGH	Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?

JACK	You said nobody came in here!
KEOUGH	Obviously I was wrong!

JACK	Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
KEOUGH	We shouldn't even really be doing this.
JACK	They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
KEOUGH	So does he.

KEOUGH	Now I'm gonna puke.
JACK	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.

JACK	Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
KEOUGH	Other than to eat us?

KEOUGH	I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
JACK	Where is he?!

JACK	If you get a safe shot...
KEOUGH	I'll take it!
JACK	Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.

KEOUGH	He's done.  He's dying.
JACK	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.

KEOUGH	Thanks for your help.
JACK	You too.

KEOUGH	He just came up screaming.
KELLY	Did he say anything?
KEOUGH	He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
KELLY	And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
KEOUGH	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
KELLY	<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
KEOUGH	Yes.
KELLY	Is the dead guy in there?
KEOUGH	That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
KELLY	Um.  No, no.  Let's go.

KEOUGH	I wouldn't.
KELLY	I'm fine, thank you.
KEOUGH	Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
KELLY	Well.  At wakes.
KEOUGH	This is a little different.
KELLY	I can look at dead things.

KELLY	This... how long did this attack go on for?
KEOUGH	Seconds.  Three, four.
KELLY	And this is how he came to the boat?
KEOUGH	Yes.
KELLY	Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?

KEOUGH	Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
KELLY	You talk to the married couple?
KEOUGH	Not yet.
KELLY	What kind of backup do we have?
KEOUGH	<u>We</u>?

KELLY	What?
KEOUGH	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
KELLY	You have a thing against museums?
KEOUGH	I got nothing against--
KELLY	Ever even been <u>in</u> one?

KELLY	<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
KEOUGH	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
KELLY	And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?

KEOUGH	You're sort of a rude person.
KELLY	It's just that--

KELLY	We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
KEOUGH	Was he swallowed?
KELLY	Sheriff.

KELLY	What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
KEOUGH	They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
KELLY	Gee.

KEOUGH	The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
KELLY	We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
KEOUGH	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
KELLY	Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
KEOUGH	What the hell?

KELLY	What?
KEOUGH	I thought I saw...
KELLY	It looks like a branch.

KEOUGH	Hey!!
KELLY	You threw it at me!!
KEOUGH	I just let go of it.

KEOUGH	With what?
KELLY	Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.

KEOUGH	They don't believe her.
KELLY	Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 

KELLY	You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
KEOUGH	<u>Apologize</u>?

KEOUGH	Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
KELLY	It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
KEOUGH	Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
KELLY	I'm sorry.

KEOUGH	Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
KELLY	I asked you to be nice to him.

KELLY	He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
KEOUGH	And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
KELLY	He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
KEOUGH	You like Jack?
KELLY	<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
KEOUGH	Hector thinks you like him.
KELLY	Well Hector's a giant cracker.
KEOUGH	You think Jack's handsome?
KELLY	What is this?
KEOUGH	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
KELLY	Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.

KEOUGH	Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
KELLY	<u>That</u> was a bust.

KELLY	What was that?
KEOUGH	I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.

KEOUGH	Are you alright?
KELLY	I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?

KELLY	Hank?
KEOUGH	Yes.

KELLY	Are you okay?
KEOUGH	Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?

KELLY	Hank!
KEOUGH	He said he knew Karate!

KELLY	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
KEOUGH	Look.

KELLY	What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
KEOUGH	What?
KELLY	Look ten feet into the water.

KELLY	If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
KEOUGH	She's worried about the cow now.

KEOUGH	They're coming right in.
KELLY	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
KEOUGH	That it's about to go wrong.

KELLY	Did you get him?
KEOUGH	I don't know.  Back the truck--

KEOUGH	Should I?
KELLY	Wait.

KELLY	I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
KEOUGH	I guess.

KEVIN	Kelly.
KELLY	Kevin, hey.

KEVIN	Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
KELLY	Absolutely.

KEVIN	I had a great time last night. Again.
KELLY	Me too.

KELLY	That's not what you came to say.
KEVIN	You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

KELLY	I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
KEVIN	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
KELLY	Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
KEVIN	The somebody else part?
KELLY	Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
KEVIN	Else.

KELLY	Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
KEVIN	A jerk.
KELLY	<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
KEVIN	It's ten after nine.
KELLY	Yes, well...  famished.

KEVIN	Hey.
KELLY	Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
KEVIN	This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
KELLY	A tooth?
KEVIN	A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
KELLY	Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
KEVIN	I want you to go there.

KELLY	Sorry?
KEVIN	I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
KELLY	This is what we do?
KEVIN	I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
KELLY	Are you on drugs?
KEVIN	Kelly--
KELLY	I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
KEVIN	Part of our research--
KELLY	I'm not even a field person.
KEVIN	Well on this one I'd like you to be.

KELLY	This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
KEVIN	It has nothing to do with--
KELLY	I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
KEVIN	<u>Kelly</u>--
KELLY	<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.

KELLY	What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
OKUBO	I <u>tapped</u> you.
KELLY	Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
OKUBO	Wild guess.
KELLY	I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
OKUBO	Kevin told me you were upset.
KELLY	Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
OKUBO	Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.

KELLY	<u>You</u>?
OKUBO	It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
KELLY	<u>You</u>?
OKUBO	It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
KELLY	You and Kevin.
OKUBO	It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...

KELLY	You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
OKUBO	Kelly--
KELLY	I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
OKUBO	Backstabber?
KELLY	No.
OKUBO	Liar?
KELLY	Myra.
OKUBO	Shitbutt?
KELLY	I really... I should get back.

AMBROSE	- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
STAMP	All done, chief..
AMBROSE	- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
STAMP	Not possible..

STAMP	Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
AMBROSE	From her point of view or mine?
STAMP	Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?

AMBROSE	One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
STAMP	Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.

AMBROSE	You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
STAMP	Sean, please..

STAMP	I thought you were going to dinner.
AMBROSE	Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
STAMP	Where is it?
AMBROSE	In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..

STAMP	Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
AMBROSE	Hugh, I'm impressed..

AMBROSE	Not much luggage.
NYAH	I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
AMBROSE	How grateful?
NYAH	Well that depends.
AMBROSE	On what.
NYAH	How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
AMBROSE	How I usually find you, Nyah.
NYAH	How do you that.
AMBROSE	Magic...
NYAH	Ahh..

NYAH	Your room.
AMBROSE	Mmmm.
NYAH	And my room?

NYAH	You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
AMBROSE	Oh, I am.  Later..

AMBROSE	I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
NYAH	Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.

AMBROSE	Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
NYAH	Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...

AMBROSE	You won.
NYAH	I suppose I did.
AMBROSE	What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
NYAH	'Thief in the Night?'
AMBROSE	Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?

AMBROSE	See anything you like?
NYAH	Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..

NYAH	To win?
AMBROSE	What else?

AMBROSE	You picked another winner!
NYAH	Well, that's good, isn't?

NYAH	Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
AMBROSE	Then don't say it.
NYAH	I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
AMBROSE	To do what?
NYAH	Sort it all out.
AMBROSE	And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
NYAH	A change of plans?
AMBROSE	Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
NYAH	Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
AMBROSE	Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
NYAH	Lovely.

AMBROSE	Feel like pleading for your life?
NYAH	Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

AMBROSE	God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
NYAH	If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.

AMBROSE	If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
NYAH	What are you talking about?
AMBROSE	In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.

MCCLOY	Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
AMBROSE	Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
MCCLOY	What are you talking about?
AMBROSE	An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
MCCLOY	Where?
AMBROSE	In downtown Sydney for a start.

MCCLOY	Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
AMBROSE	Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.

AMBROSE	Nyah!
ETHAN	Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.

AMBROSE	If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
ETHAN	Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.

ETHAN	Fight a bit of a cold..
AMBROSE	And you're happy about that?
ETHAN	Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
AMBROSE	You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
ETHAN	I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
AMBROSE	I knew where it was.
ETHAN	Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.

ETHAN	There it is, guys, the last of it.
AMBROSE	Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
ETHAN	What was the top bid?
AMBROSE	Why, you going to make me a better offer?
ETHAN	Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
AMBROSE	Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.

ETHAN	She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
AMBROSE	She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.

AMBROSE	Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
ETHAN	In other words, you're calling her a flake.

WALLIS	Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
AMBROSE	It's that time.  Go.

AMBROSE	Not exactly.  Wallis?
WALLIS	More like two-two point two million.
AMBROSE	In any case we don't want your cash.

AMBROSE	-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
WALLIS	Ninety-three point four million.
AMBROSE	Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.

BILLY	Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
ETHAN	It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.

BILLY	What you got there, mate?
ETHAN	A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
BILLY	Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
ETHAN	..or hard wired..
BILLY	- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.

BILLY	Well do you disagree with that?
ETHAN	Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
BILLY	Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.

BILLY	Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
ETHAN	I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.

ETHAN	Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
BILLY	What are you talking about?
ETHAN	Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.

LUTHER	It is, Billy.
BILLY	Then we got'em!

BILLY	Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
LUTHER	What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?

LUTHER	So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
BILLY	There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?

BILLY	Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
LUTHER	I'm not ready!

LUTHER	Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
BILLY	Exactly where is she?
LUTHER	..in the building...

BILLY	Before we kill her or cure her..
LUTHER	Right.

BILLY	We're due to take off.
LUTHER	Not for seven more minutes.

LUTHER	Range is two kay.
BILLY	I hope there's a place to land.

BILLY	There she is.  I got visual.
LUTHER	We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..

BILLY	That's it?  That's it? That's it?
LUTHER	And the check's in the mall.
BILLY	Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.

LUTHER	I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
BILLY'S VOICE	He's heading down the stairs, now..

BILLY'S VOICE	Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
LUTHER	I am. She is.

LUTHER	She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
BILLY'S VOICE	How much longer before you can reach him?
LUTHER	Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..

BILLY'S VOICE	How're we doin', then?
LUTHER	He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
BILLY'S VOICE	What can we do' mate?
LUTHER	Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.

ETHAN	Do you know me?
NYAH	No.  Should I?
ETHAN	No.  You just looked as if you did.
NYAH	No.  Just as if I'd like to.
ETHAN	Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
NYAH	Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
ETHAN	There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.

NYAH	Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
ETHAN	What if I pay the rent?
NYAH	Uh-huh.
ETHAN	Uh-huh?

NYAH	What are you doing here?
ETHAN	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
NYAH	I see.  You're not just another pretty face..

NYAH	Would you mind if I'm on top?
ETHAN	Oh, either way works for me.

NYAH	- right..where is it?
ETHAN	Far right.

NYAH	Where's the bloody -
ETHAN	- torque wrench.
NYAH	- this is very disconerting..
ETHAN	Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
NYAH	- right..

ETHAN	I wouldn't do that.
NYAH	Do what?

ETHAN	Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
NYAH	Indeed.
ETHAN	Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?

NYAH	I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
ETHAN	At least you walked.
NYAH	If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
ETHAN	Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
NYAH	May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
ETHAN	Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
NYAH	Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
ETHAN	You didn't do that badly.

NYAH	You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
ETHAN	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..

NYAH	Hola..
ETHAN	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
NYAH	Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!

ETHAN	Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
NYAH	Listen to what?
ETHAN	I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
NYAH	Your help?  What are you talking about?
ETHAN	Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
NYAH	Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.

NYAH	What's you name?
ETHAN	Ethan Hunt.
NYAH	Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?

NYAH	Awfully short notice..
ETHAN	Care to wait a decent interval?
NYAH	Who wants to be decent?..

NYAH	When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
ETHAN	Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
NYAH	They've got a book for this?
ETHAN	They've got a book for everything.
NYAH	The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
ETHAN	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
NYAH	That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
ETHAN	Which is?
NYAH	That they're lying.

ETHAN	So where did I got right?
NYAH	You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
ETHAN	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.

NYAH	Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
ETHAN	So do I.  Sort of.

NYAH	Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
ETHAN	Of what?

NYAH	Ask a question, you get an answer!..
ETHAN	Damn, you're beautiful.
NYAH	That's because I'm on my back.

NYAH	What's the population of Seville any idea?
ETHAN	Five, six-hundred thousand.
NYAH	There's nearly 2 million in London.
ETHAN	And six billion in the world.
NYAH	That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
ETHAN	Sean Ambrose, for one.

NYAH	Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
ETHAN	This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
NYAH	But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..

ETHAN	Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
NYAH	I'd like a little more conviction..
ETHAN	So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
NYAH	You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
ETHAN	Something like that.

NYAH	But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
ETHAN	You can be a thief and have a conscience.
NYAH	No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
ETHAN	I don't.
NYAH	Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
ETHAN	Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
NYAH	And that's the only reason?
ETHAN	Can you think of a better one?
NYAH	Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
ETHAN	Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
NYAH	Much.
ETHAN	Then feel better!..

NYAH	Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
ETHAN	What wouldn't make him suspicious?
NYAH	Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..

ETHAN	Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
NYAH	This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
ETHAN	Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
NYAH	Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.

ETHAN	Before you are.
NYAH	How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
ETHAN	You don't trust me.
NYAH	Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
ETHAN	He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
NYAH	Yes?
ETHAN	You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
NYAH	Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
ETHAN	Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..

ETHAN	How's it going?  Everything okay?
NYAH	Just like old times.
ETHAN	Just like old times?
NYAH	Just about..

ETHAN	We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
NYAH	- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
ETHAN	Have you met them?
NYAH	Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
ETHAN	I've no doubt.

NYAH	Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
ETHAN	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --

NYAH	-- his left jacket pocket.
ETHAN	Affirmative.

NYAH	Where do I meet you?
ETHAN	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
NYAH	I'll muddle through.

NYAH	I managed.
ETHAN	You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?

ETHAN	I want <i>you out of there.</i>
NYAH	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?

ETHAN	Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
NYAH	Ethan, tell me -

ETHAN	I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
NYAH	How do you suggest I go about it?
ETHAN	He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.

ETHAN	Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
NYAH	Oh Ethan!..

ETHAN	Are you okay?
NYAH	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
ETHAN	It's going to be okay.

NYAH	Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
ETHAN	Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
NYAH	What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
ETHAN	No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!

ETHAN	What did you think you were doing!
NYAH	I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.

ETHAN	- you who don't have a conscience.
NYAH	I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
ETHAN	No.
NYAH	Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
ETHAN	No.
NYAH	I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.

ETHAN	No.  Should I?
NYAH	No.  You just looked as if you did.
ETHAN	No...

ETHAN	Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
SWANBECK	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
ETHAN	Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
SWANBECK	Why did you phrase it like that?
ETHAN	Like what?
SWANBECK	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
ETHAN	You gotta be kidding.

ETHAN	An idea, yeah.
SWANBECK	Like?
ETHAN	Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
SWANBECK	Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..

ETHAN	If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
SWANBECK	You were there.

SWANBECK	When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
ETHAN	Twice.
SWANBECK	What did you think of him?
ETHAN	You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
SWANBECK	Not necessarily.

ETHAN	So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
SWANBECK	Then you do think it was Ambrose.

ETHAN	Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
SWANBECK	Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?

ETHAN	Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
SWANBECK	The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?

ETHAN	Right now only Ambrose knows that.
SWANBECK	In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
ETHAN	In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
SWANBECK	- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
ETHAN	'Terrorists?'
SWANBECK	Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
ETHAN	If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
SWANBECK	- is where Miss Hall comes in.
ETHAN	Excuse me?
SWANBECK	Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
ETHAN	And then what?
SWANBECK	Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
ETHAN	You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
SWANBECK	Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
ETHAN	She's got no training for this kind of thing.
SWANBECK	Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.

ETHAN	I don't think I can get her to do it.
SWANBECK	You mean it'll be difficult.
ETHAN	Very.
SWANBECK	Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.

ETHAN	Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
SWANBECK	We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
ETHAN	We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
SWANBECK	Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
ETHAN	Yes, I believe that's right.
SWANBECK	But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
ETHAN	You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
SWANBECK	Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.

SWANBECK	- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
ETHAN	She sacrificed herself..
SWANBECK	Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.

SWANBECK	Something else?
ETHAN	Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
SWANBECK	No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..

SWANBECK	Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
ETHAN	You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
SWANBECK	Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
ETHAN	I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
SWANBECK	Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
ETHAN	Yes, I gathered as much.
SWANBECK	And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
ETHAN	Yes.
SWANBECK	And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
ETHAN	Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
SWANBECK	But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
ETHAN	By fire.  That's the best way, really.

ETHAN	No, I don't.  But in this case -
SWANBECK	In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
ETHAN	I do.
SWANBECK	Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
ETHAN	I don't.  No exactly.
SWANBECK	Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
ETHAN	Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
SWANBECK	Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

ETHAN	You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
NEKHORVICH	Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
ETHAN	They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
NEKHORVICH	I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
ETHAN	Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
NEKHORVICH	Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.

ETHAN	He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
NEKHORVICH	Yes, he knew.  Just..
ETHAN	..not in time to save him.
NEKHORVICH	No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>

NEKHORVICH	..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
ETHAN	You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.

ETHAN	..I'm fine..and you?
NEKHORVICH	I'm fine..

LUTHER	It's the transponder.
ETHAN	Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
LUTHER	The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.

ETHAN	Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
LUTHER	That simple, huh?
ETHAN	Why not?

ETHAN	Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
LUTHER	Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.

LUTHER	Nekhorvich's boss?
ETHAN	Yep.

LUTHER	Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
ETHAN	Left jacket pocket?
LUTHER	Roger that.
ETHAN	Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
LUTHER	Left jacket pocket confirmed.
ETHAN	Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --

ETHAN	I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
LUTHER	She must still be on the property.
ETHAN	I told her to get outta there.

ETHAN	Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
LUTHER	Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
ETHAN	I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
LUTHER	You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..

LUTHER	Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
ETHAN	Nyah still on the property?

ETHAN	Let's start from the inside out.
LUTHER	All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.

ETHAN	Now how to get in there.
LUTHER	No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.

LUTHER	Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
ETHAN	I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.

ETHAN	Luther, I'm looking at security.
LUTHER	Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.

LUTHER	Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
ETHAN	Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

ETHAN	Luther, say again.
LUTHER	She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
ETHAN	Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.

LUTHER	So what did he say?
ETHAN	Good job.  And thanks.

NEKHORVICH	A visit from an old friend.
MCCLOY	What's happening here?  You're dead!
NEKHORVICH	Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
MCCLOY	It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
NEKHORVICH	You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.

MCCLOY	You have Bellerophon.
NEKHORVICH	Do I?
MCCLOY	You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
NEKHORVICH	'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
MCCLOY	Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
NEKHORVICH	By asking me.
MCCLOY	You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
NEKHORVICH	You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
MCCLOY	Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
NEKHORVICH	You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.

BILLY	You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
ANTHONY	That's your line for tonight, ya know.
BILLY	What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
ANTHONY	No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.

BILLY	Are you sure they're here?
ANTHONY	If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!

ANTHONY	What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
BILLY	He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?

BETTY	Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
BARBARA	You mean hiding them?
BETTY	Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!

BARBARA	We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
BETTY	Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.

BARBARA	Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
BETTY	He was that good?
BARBARA	No, I was.

BETTY	I wish she could forget him.
BARBARA	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

RED	He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
BETTY	Red...Strange?
RED	You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
BETTY	But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
RED	How would I know.

BETTY	Do you always stutter?
RED	Only when I'm n-n-n-
BETTY	Nervous?
RED	Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
RAFE	That's me, Sir.
BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
RAFE	If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
BRITISH AIR COMMANDER	Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
RAFE	Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.

COLONEL	You're Walker, right?
DANNY	Yes Sir.
COLONEL	That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
DANNY	You liked that?
COLONEL	Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
DANNY	Sir?
COLONEL	I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
DANNY	Hale-what?
COLONEL	You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
DANNY	Sir, I --
COLONEL	Too late for apologies, Walker.
DANNY	I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.

DANNY	Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
COMA	Where's that lizard?
DANNY	What lizard?
COMA	The one that slept in my mouth last night.
DANNY	What the hell happened to you guys?

DANNY	Yeah.
COMA	Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.

DANNY	Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
COMA	You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --

COMA	Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
RED	A m-missionary?
COMA	No, like...

RED	I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
COMA	You guys are new?

COMA	Shit, he's puking on my feet!
RED	Well, you p-puked on his feet.
COMA	Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!

DANNY	They ready, Earl?
EARL	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

EARL	Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
DANNY	You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!

DANNY	Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
EARL	Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.

EARL	Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
DANNY	Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.

EARL	Who the fuck taught you to fly?
DANNY	He did.

RAFE	Bandits at 2 o'clock.
DANNY	Power dive!

RAFE	It's Germans!
DANNY	Kill the bastards!

RAFE	Good shooting, Danny!
DANNY	Good shooting, Rafe!
RAFE	Land of the free...
DANNY	Home of the brave!
RAFE	There's another one!

RAFE	Didn't you say test the limits?
DANNY	Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!

DANNY	How could you do this?
RAFE	The Colonel helped me work it out.
DANNY	I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
RAFE	I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
DANNY	Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
RAFE	Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.

DANNY	Nah, you go on.
RAFE	I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
DANNY	Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.

DANNY	Didn't you say you told her not to come?
RAFE	Yeah.
DANNY	Then why are you looking for her?
RAFE	It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.

DANNY	You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
RAFE	Upset?  Why should I be upset?
DANNY	Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.

RAFE	Sorry.
DANNY	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
RAFE	I didn't mean it.
DANNY	Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
RAFE	Waitress!  Four beers!
DANNY	You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
RAFE	If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

RAFE	We gotta face some facts here.
DANNY	What facts are those?
RAFE	I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
DANNY	I was grieving too.
RAFE	Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
DANNY	So what are you saying?
RAFE	I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
DANNY	You left her.  How's that for a fact?
RAFE	How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.

RAFE	How come you're not pukin'?
DANNY	I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.

DANNY	Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
RAFE	Fuck you.
DANNY	She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.

DANNY	She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
RAFE	How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?

RAFE	Get me into a plane!
DANNY	Come on!

RAFE	Where are we going?
DANNY	Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
RAFE	What's there?
DANNY	Six P-40's.

DANNY	This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
RAFE	They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?

DANNY	It's tight.
RAFE	Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.

DANNY	They're all over us!
RAFE	Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

RAFE	You hear my okay?
DANNY	Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
RAFE	I got a half a tank.  You?
DANNY	Little less.

RAFE	Land of the free.
DANNY	Home of the brave.

RAFE	I'm out of ammo!
DANNY	I'm out of fuel!

DANNY	Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
RAFE	What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?

DANNY	Fun today.  Like old times.
RAFE	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
DANNY	What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
RAFE	No.  You're trying to beat me.
DANNY	We've always tried to beat each other.
RAFE	Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?

DANNY	Maybe just trying to measure up.
RAFE	What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.

DANNY	It's shorter than our practice runway.
RAFE	They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
DANNY	We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"

RAFE	It's not getting any longer.
DANNY	Longer?  It's getting shorter.

DANNY	Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
RAFE	We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
DANNY	And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
RAFE	Home of the Brave.

RAFE	Danny...
DANNY	I can't make it.
RAFE	Yes you can.

DANNY	Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
MECHANIC	The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
DANNY	What about easier to hit in an air raid?
MECHANIC	Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
DANNY	Yeah.
MECHANIC	We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!

DANNY	Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
EVELYN	Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.

DANNY	Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
EVELYN	He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
DANNY	Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
EVELYN	You were more like brothers.
DANNY	I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
EVELYN	He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
DANNY	...He said that?

DANNY	How's everything?
EVELYN	We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
DANNY	That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
EVELYN	I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
DANNY	I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.

DANNY	Sorry.
EVELYN	He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
DANNY	Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
EVELYN	Well...sure.
DANNY	From the air?

EVELYN	So beautiful!
DANNY	Hang on.

RED	And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
DOOLITTLE	The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.

RED	C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
DOOLITTLE	We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
RED	Then wh-where do we land?
DOOLITTLE	I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

DOOLITTLE	Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
RED	I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
DOOLITTLE	I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
RED	Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
DOOLITTLE	No baseball diamonds, Red.
RED	Y-Yes Sir.

DOOLITTLE	There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
RAFE	How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
DOOLITTLE	Don't get smart with me, son.
RAFE	Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
DOOLITTLE	That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
RAFE	Thank you, Sir.

DOOLITTLE	Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
RAFE	Thank you, Sir.

DOOLITTLE	I heard what you did.
RAFE	We can explain, Colonel.
DOOLITTLE	Explain what?

RAFE	Is that the good new, Sir, or --
DOOLITTLE	You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
RAFE	Well sure, Colonel --
DOOLITTLE	Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.

DOOLITTLE	In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
RAFE	Bombers.
DOOLITTLE	I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.

DOOLITTLE	I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
RAFE	I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.

DOOLITTLE	Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
RAFE	Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
DOOLITTLE	I know.

DORIE	'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
EVELYN	Our doctor's gone too.
DORIE	Sorry to trouble you.
EVELYN	Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.

EVELYN	How'd you get this?
DORIE	Boxin'.
EVELYN	Win?
DORIE	Yes'm.

EVELYN	What's your name?
DORIE	Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
EVELYN	I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?

EVELYN	How often you fight like this?
DORIE	Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
EVELYN	What do you get for winning?
DORIE	Respect.

DORIE	Thank you, 'Mam.
EVELYN	Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
DORIE	I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.

EVELYN	You take care, Dorie.
DORIE	You too, 'Mam.

RAFE	Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
EVELYN	You too, Lieutenant.

EVELYN	Oh, this is Betty.
RAFE	Nice to meet you, Betty.

EVELYN	Danny's not coming?
RAFE	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
EVELYN	I was hoping to meet him.

EVELYN	Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
RAFE	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
EVELYN	It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.

RAFE	There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
EVELYN	We're all going away.
RAFE	I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
EVELYN	But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
RAFE	Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
EVELYN	You waited til tonight to tell me?
RAFE	I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.

RAFE	Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
EVELYN	I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
RAFE	Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
EVELYN	Do one thing for me, before you go.

RAFE	I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
EVELYN	Why were you sitting here, instead of...
RAFE	I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
EVELYN	How did you?...
RAFE	...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.

RAFE	I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
EVELYN	I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
RAFE	Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.

EVELYN	It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
RAFE	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.

RAFE	It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
EVELYN	It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
RAFE	Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
EVELYN	It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --

RAFE	What else can we do?
EVELYN	There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --

EVELYN	Rafe --
RAFE	I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
EVELYN	Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
RAFE	Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
EVELYN	That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --

RAFE	What?...
EVELYN	They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
RAFE	It must of been a convincing letter.
EVELYN	It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.

YAMAMOTO	Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
GENDA	I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.

YAMAMOTO	Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
GENDA	If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
YAMAMOTO	Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
GENDA	Brilliant, Admiral.
YAMAMOTO	A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.

YAMAMOTO	We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
GENDA	We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
YAMAMOTO	We must go ahead.  This is our moment.

GENDA	We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
YAMAMOTO	The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?

GENDA	If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
YAMAMOTO	And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.

ROOSEVELT	What if the Japanese did invade?
GENERAL MARSHALL	We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

GENERAL MARSHALL	We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
ROOSEVELT	Have the planes made it to China?
GENERAL MARSHALL	There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
ROOSEVELT	So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
GENERAL MARSHALL	The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
ROOSEVELT	God help them.

IAN	Leapin' Jesus!
RAFE	The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
IAN	Well which of those three ya want fixed?
RAFE	All of 'em.

IAN	If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
RAFE	And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
IAN	Fook ya!
RAFE	Learn English, then!
IAN	Fook ya dooble!

IAN	I have'na been able ta --
RAFE	Crank her!

NISHIKURA	So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
YAMAMOTO	If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
NISHIKURA	The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

NISHIKURA	You have something to say, Yamamoto?
YAMAMOTO	The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
NISHIKURA	You see us as capable of such a blow?
YAMAMOTO	The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

YOLANDER	Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
CHASE	I... um...

CHASE	...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
YOLANDER	The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
CHASE	Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...

YOLANDER	You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
CHASE	Well... uh... thanks...

YOLANDER	Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
CHASE	My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...

GUS	Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
CHASE	Pretty much so.

GUS	I hear you moved into town.
CHASE	I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?

CHASE	That's Renee alright.
GUS	I suppose so.

GUS	When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
CHASE	There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.

CHASE	Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
GUS	--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

GUS	I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
CHASE	How'd you know that?

GUS	I was building a doggy door.
CHASE	God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!

CHASE	What?
RUDMAN	I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
CHASE	Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
RUDMAN	Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.

RUDMAN	You took over for Doctor Yolander?
CHASE	Yes... why?
RUDMAN	Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...

MARJORIE	Is something wrong?
CHASE	Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.

MARJORIE	I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
CHASE	Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.

CHASE	Out?
MARJORIE	He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
CHASE	What do they do up there?
MARJORIE	Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.

MARJORIE	What happened to you?
CHASE	I had a little run-in with Zowie.
MARJORIE	You sure did...

MARJORIE	I hope he doesn't have rabies.
CHASE	He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...

GEOFF	How long ago did this guy retire?
CHASE	It's been a few years.

CHASE	What's wrong?!
GEOFF	Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.

CHASE	What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
GEOFF	Sure.

CHASE	You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
GEOFF	I'll be fine, Dad.

CHASE	Hey! How was your first day at school?
GEOFF	It sucked.

GEOFF	What?
CHASE	You alright?

CHASE	I think so.
CHASE	Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
GEOFF	I still can't believe she's dead...

GEOFF	Who was that?
CHASE	Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.

CHASE	Hey! Where're you off to?
GEOFF	I'm going out, Dad!

GEOFF	Just out.
CHASE	Out. Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
GEOFF	I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?

CHASE	Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
GEOFF	I'm not hungry.

CHASE	What are you talking about?
GEOFF	I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...

CHASE	Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
GEOFF	He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.

GEOFF	All set?
CHASE	All set.

CHASE	So where're we going?
GEOFF	Anywhere but here.

GUS	Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
DREW	Is he gonna be okay?

GUS	Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
DREW	Just until he heals up?

GUS	Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
DREW	Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.

GUS	Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
DREW	I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.

DREW	Zowie...
GUS	Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.

GEOFF	What's his name?
DREW	Zowie.

DREW	I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
GEOFF	He pissed me off.
DREW	Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...

DREW	I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
GEOFF	You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
DREW	Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

GEOFF	What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
DREW	Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...

GEOFF	Is this a good spot?
DREW	I'm not burying him here...
GEOFF	Why not?
DREW	There's a better place...

DREW	This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
GEOFF	What did?
DREW	The old Indian burial ground.

GEOFF	Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
DREW	What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
GEOFF	Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
DREW	Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?

GEOFF	You want me to help?
DREW	You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...

DREW	I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
GEOFF	You never get over it.

GEOFF	It's getting pretty late. We better go.
DREW	Yeah...

GEOFF	Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
DREW	He was dead. You know he was.

GEOFF	You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
DREW	You think he'd believe it if he did?

GEOFF	How can he not have a heartbeat?
DREW	Maybe it takes a while...

DREW	It's weird...
GEOFF	What do you mean?
DREW	It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...

GEOFF	What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
DREW	I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...

GEOFF	Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
DREW	I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
GEOFF	Dies?

DREW	I gotta go back and do my chores...
GEOFF	Go later...

DREW	You ever think about running away?
GEOFF	All the time.

RENEE	Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
GEOFF	Right here, Mom...

RENEE	How long have you been here?
GEOFF	Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.

RENEE	How did it go with your father last night?
GEOFF	Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
RENEE	I miss him too...

GEOFF	I know, Mom.
RENEE	You know everything, don't you?

GEOFF	Mom...
RENEE	I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.

ZAIUS	Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.

CORNELIUS	Dr. Zaius --
ZAIUS	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
CORNELIUS	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
ZAIUS	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

ZAIUS	He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
CORNELIUS	Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...

CORNELIUS	How did you know we'd come here?
ZAIUS	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.

ZAIUS	I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
CORNELIUS	We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
ZAIUS	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.

CORNELIUS	Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
ZAIUS	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
CORNELIUS	I apologize.
ZAIUS	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.

CORNELIUS	A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
ZAIUS	Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
CORNELIUS	No sir, I haven't forgotten.

CORNELIUS	Seal the cave?
ZAIUS	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

CORNELIUS	Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
TAYLOR	Do you have any weapons?
CORNELIUS	The best. But we won't need them.
TAYLOR	Just the same, I want one.

CORNELIUS	As you wish.
TAYLOR	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

CORNELIUS	To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
TAYLOR	You still don't believe me, do you?
CORNELIUS	It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?

TAYLOR	Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
CORNELIUS	Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
TAYLOR	I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.

TAYLOR	Where does the river lead?
CORNELIUS	It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.

TAYLOR	You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
CORNELIUS	No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.

TAYLOR	When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
CORNELIUS	Right now, if you like.

TAYLOR	If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
CORNELIUS	Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
TAYLOR	Shut up.

CORNELIUS	Taylor, I'd rather you -
TAYLOR	No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.

TAYLOR	Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
CORNELIUS	What are you doing there?
TAYLOR	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?

CORNELIUS	That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
TAYLOR	And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.

CORNELIUS	They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
TAYLOR	Good luck then.

CORNELIUS	Do you have to work tonight?
ZIRA	No.
CORNELIUS	Neither do I.

ZIRA	That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
CORNELIUS	What's so special about him?
ZIRA	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?

ZIRA	Look -- she remembers.
CORNELIUS	Remembers what?
ZIRA	The blood transfusion.
CORNELIUS	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

CORNELIUS	It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
ZIRA	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
CORNELIUS	Where did you learn to do this?

CORNELIUS	Now, just a minute --
ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.

ZIRA	'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
CORNELIUS	And they fell out of the sky with you?

CORNELIUS	Flight is a scientific impossibility.
ZIRA	And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?

ZIRA	Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
CORNELIUS	No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.

ZIRA	'Then how do you account for me?,
CORNELIUS	I don't. And I'm not going to try.
ZIRA	But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
CORNELIUS	Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
ZIRA	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
CORNELIUS	No, they won't -

ZIRA	Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
CORNELIUS	It's probably wrong --
ZIRA	-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
CORNELIUS	The evidence was very meager --
ZIRA	You didn't think so then.
CORNELIUS	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
ZIRA	How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -

ZIRA	'I am not a missing link.'
CORNELIUS	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
ZIRA	Well, maybe they're not.
CORNELIUS	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
CORNELIUS	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --

ZIRA	A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
CORNELIUS	Zira....

CORNELIUS	How did it go?
ZIRA	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.

ZIRA	We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
CORNELIUS	Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.

TAYLOR	Got your sensors?
DODGE	Yo!
TAYLOR	Geiger counter?
DODGE	Yo!
TAYLOR	One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
DODGE	But how long is a day?
TAYLOR	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.

DODGE	Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
TAYLOR	Any sign of dangerous ionization?
DODGE	No.
TAYLOR	Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.

DODGE	Which direction?
TAYLOR	That way.
DODGE	Any particular reason?
TAYLOR	None at all.

DODGE	Taylor -- quit riding him.
TAYLOR	You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.

DODGE	Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
TAYLOR	Let's find them all.

TAYLOR	Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
DODGE	Blessed are the vegetarians.

ZIRA	Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
GALEN	Him.

ZIRA	Will he live?
GALEN	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.

ZIRA	This place is dirty, doctor.
GALEN	These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?

GALEN	But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
ZIRA	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
GALEN	You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
ZIRA	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
GALEN	Hmph.
ZIRA	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
GALEN	They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...

HONORIUS	Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
PRESIDENT	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

PRESIDENT	State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
HONORIUS	Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.

HONORIUS	There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
PRESIDENT	Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
HONORIUS	Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...

HONORIUS	He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
PRESIDENT	Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.

HONORIUS	That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
PRESIDENT	Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.

HONORIUS	Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
PRESIDENT	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.

HONORIUS	Objection!
PRESIDENT	Sustained.

HONORIUS	Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
PRESIDENT	Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.

HONORIUS	Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
TAYLOR	I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
HONORIUS	Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
TAYLOR	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
HONORIUS	Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
TAYLOR	Show this to the President.

JULIUS	Good morning, Dr. Zira.
ZIRA	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
JULIUS	No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.

JULIUS	You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
ZIRA	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

ZIRA	Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
JULIUS	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

ZIRA	Did you see that? It's remarkable!
JULIUS	Huh?
ZIRA	He's trying to form words.
JULIUS	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.

JULIUS	What happened?
ZIRA	Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
JULIUS	I'll see.

ZIRA	Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
JULIUS	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
ZIRA	Do as I say.

TAYLOR	Landon! Send a last signal.
LANDON	What signal?
TAYLOR	To Earth! That we've landed!

LANDON	It's no use ... there she goes.
TAYLOR	Forget it. Abandon ship.

LANDON	Gone.
TAYLOR	We're here to stay.

LANDON	Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
TAYLOR	We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.

TAYLOR	Landon! Join the expedition.
LANDON	Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
TAYLOR	Air leak. Died in her sleep.
LANDON	You don't seem very cut up about it.
TAYLOR	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
LANDON	Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
TAYLOR	By our time.  You've turned gray.

TAYLOR	Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
LANDON	long pause) You know it.
TAYLOR	Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
LANDON	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
TAYLOR	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.

LANDON	If only we could get a fix.
TAYLOR	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.

LANDON	All right --
TAYLOR	There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
LANDON	I'm prepared to die.

TAYLOR	Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
LANDON	Climb off me, will you!
TAYLOR	And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
TAYLOR	Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?

LANDON	Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
TAYLOR	Don't bother
LANDON	Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
TAYLOR	But I'm not prepared to die.
LANDON	I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.

LANDON	Scarecrows?
TAYLOR	Let's take a look.

LANDON	Can we take a dip?
TAYLOR	Okay.

TAYLOR	No cigar.
LANDON	Try telling them our names.

LANDON	We got off at the wrong stop.
TAYLOR	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.

TAYLOR	Who are you?
LUCIUS	So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
TAYLOR	Come on. Get me out of here.

TAYLOR	She comes along too.
LUCIUS	Zira doesn't want your female.
TAYLOR	I want her.
LUCIUS	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
TAYLOR	Fine. Just let her out.

LUCIUS	Shouldn't we be moving on?
TAYLOR	I'm for that.

LUCIUS	Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
TAYLOR	In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

TAYLOR	Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
LUCIUS	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
TAYLOR	Relax. You'll see it all later.

TAYLOR	Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
LUCIUS	Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
TAYLOR	All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
LUCIUS	What is it?
TAYLOR	I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
LUCIUS	Yes, I can do that.

LUCIUS	They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
TAYLOR	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.

TAYLOR	Lucius.
LUCIUS	I think you're making a mistake.
TAYLOR	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
LUCIUS	What?
TAYLOR	The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.

ZIRA	I told you not to bring the other one.
LUCIUS	He wouldn't leave her.
ZIRA	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.

LUCIUS	Gorilla hunters ...
ZIRA	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

LUCIUS	Who put them up?
ZIRA	The Hunt Club.
LUCIUS	To scare off humans?

MAXIMUS	What is that?
ZIRA	A man, Dr. Maximus.
MAXIMUS	I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.

ZIRA	Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
MAXIMUS	Why special?
ZIRA	We're -- conducting a new experiment.

MAXIMUS	You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
ZIRA	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
MAXIMUS	And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
ZIRA	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.

PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
TAYLOR	My name is Taylor.

PRESIDENT	It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
TAYLOR	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.

TAYLOR	One is in a museum!
PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

TAYLOR	You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!

PRESIDENT	Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ZIRA	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.

PRESIDENT	Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
ZIRA	Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.

ZIRA	ThatÕs a lie!
PRESIDENT	Mind your tongue, madame.
ZIRA	Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.

ZIRA	Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
PRESIDENT	Read it yourself.
ZIRA	'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
PRESIDENT	Stop right there. Bring me that paper.

PRESIDENT	This is a joke in very poor taste.
ZIRA	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?

PRESIDENT	How so?
ZIRA	Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.

PRESIDENT	Sustained.
ZIRA	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

ZAIUS	Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
TAYLOR	With one of them.
ZAIUS	Identify him, then. Speak to him.

TAYLOR	What about me?
ZAIUS	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
TAYLOR	No.
ZAIUS	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.

ZAIUS	However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
TAYLOR	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
ZAIUS	You lied. Where is your tribe?
TAYLOR	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
ZAIUS	Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
TAYLOR	What about it?
ZAIUS	A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
TAYLOR	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
TAYLOR	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
ZAIUS	Of course.
TAYLOR	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
ZAIUS	Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
TAYLOR	Then you admit --
ZAIUS	I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
TAYLOR	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
ZAIUS	You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
TAYLOR	I don't know.
ZAIUS	If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
TAYLOR	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
ZAIUS	You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!

TAYLOR	Stop right there.
ZAIUS	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.

ZAIUS	There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
TAYLOR	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.

ZAIUS	What is your proposal?
TAYLOR	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
ZAIUS	Twelve hundred years ago.
TAYLOR	Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
ZAIUS	Of course.
TAYLOR	Okay.Up to the cave.

TAYLOR	I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
ZAIUS	That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.

TAYLOR	Tell him to pull back!
ZAIUS	Cease fire! Withdraw!

ZAIUS	Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
TAYLOR	He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

TAYLOR	Then there is another jungle?
ZAIUS	Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
ZAIUS	Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
TAYLOR	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

TAYLOR	Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
ZAIUS	Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
TAYLOR	What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
ZAIUS	The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
TAYLOR	We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
ZAIUS	Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.

ZIRA	Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
TAYLOR	Listen, listen -- I can speak --

TAYLOR	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
ZIRA	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.

TAYLOR	I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
ZIRA	Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!

TAYLOR	Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
ZIRA	Shhhh!
TAYLOR	What is this?
ZIRA	A hearing.

TAYLOR	It's him...Landon.
ZIRA	Which one?
TAYLOR	Second from the left.

TAYLOR	You! ... You knew about this?
ZIRA	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
TAYLOR	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!

TAYLOR	Listen-
ZIRA	Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.

ZIRA	Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
TAYLOR	You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?

ZIRA	Are you going to take her with you?
TAYLOR	Yes.
ZIRA	Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
TAYLOR	Maybe not.
ZIRA	You want her that much?
TAYLOR	You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.

TAYLOR	What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
ZIRA	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.

TAYLOR	And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
ZIRA	Taylor, please --
TAYLOR	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.

ZIRA	Taylor! Tell him.
TAYLOR	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.

TAYLOR	Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
ZIRA	Taylor, you can't.

ZIRA	Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
TAYLOR	Why not?
ZIRA	It's humiliating.
TAYLOR	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

TAYLOR	Would you like to come along?
ZIRA	We can't.
TAYLOR	It's better than going to prison for heresy.

TAYLOR	Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
ZIRA	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!

ZIRA	Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
TAYLOR	God bless you.

ZIRA	He's moving his fingers!
ZAIUS	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
ZIRA	But perhaps he understood --

ZAIUS	Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
ZIRA	Yes, Sir.

ZAIUS	Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
ZIRA	I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
ZAIUS	Do you believe him?
ZIRA	Like you, I find it difficult.
ZAIUS	But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
ZIRA	This is his assertion.
ZAIUS	Where are they now?

ZAIUS	How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
ZIRA	He doesn't know.
ZAIUS	Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.

ZAIUS	Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
ZIRA	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.

ZAIUS	Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
ZIRA	But there's the doll, sir.
ZAIUS	What?

ZIRA	But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
ZAIUS	He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.

ZIRA	But the proof? The doll?
ZAIUS	In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.

CHURCH	Improved...how?
MEKUM	As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
CHURCH	Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...

CHURCH	...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
MEKUM	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
CHURCH	Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
MEKUM	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
CHURCH	The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
MEKUM	Such as?
CHURCH	Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...

MEKUM	Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
MEKUM	Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
CHURCH	Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.

ANNA	Oh my God, what is he doing?
WARREN	He's shutting off the air!!!

ANNA	Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
WARREN	I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

ANNA	Getting drunk is no solution.
WARREN	Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.

ANNA	I think we're moving.
WARREN	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.

ANNA	I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
WARREN	Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.

ANNA	Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
WARREN	Oh yeah...
ANNA	Oh yeah...
WARREN	Oh Sara...
ANNA	Anna...
WARREN	Anna...

WARREN	Jesus, come on!
ANNA	They're not going to make it!

WAYNE	Evening.
ANNA	It can't be.
WAYNE	Excuse me?
ANNA	You're Warren Wayne.

WAYNE	Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
ANNA	Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
WAYNE	Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
ANNA	My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
WAYNE	Oh, thank you.
ANNA	Magnificent, magnificent.
WAYNE	Well I appreciate that.
ANNA	So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
WAYNE	Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
ANNA	Of course, of course...
WAYNE	So...
ANNA	Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
WAYNE	Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
ANNA	It certainly is.

WAYNE	Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
ANNA	I'm sure I will.

WAYNE	No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
ANNA	Very professional of you.

BARNES	Where the hell did you come from?
MAC	Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.

BARNES	Weren't you down in the dining room?
MAC	I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
BARNES	Oh he did, did he?

MAC	Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
BARNES	You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
MAC	I did nothing to the monitors.

BARNES	And what are they doing now, Mac?
MAC	They are awaiting further information.

BARNES	Were you going to give it to them?
MAC	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
BARNES	Well you did the right thing Mac.

BARNES	On channel 10?
MAC	The device has stopped responding.

BARNES	Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
MAC	My...wings...

MAC	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
BARNES	I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
BARNES	And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...

BARNES	Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
REYNOLDS	Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
BARNES	Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.

REYNOLDS	What did you say to me?
BARNES	It's a little late for you to be up.
REYNOLDS	Look answer my question!

BARNES	All too well, captain.
REYNOLDS	Well shut it off at once!

BARNES	Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
TAYLOR	Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.

BARNES	No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
TAYLOR	Well it's a good thing that I did.

TAYLOR	It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
BARNES	There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
TAYLOR	Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
BARNES	Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.

TAYLOR	You're certain of that?
BARNES	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
TAYLOR	All right, I'll give it a shot.

TAYLOR	Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
BARNES	Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -

TAYLOR	So, are you on for the next one?
BARNES	I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
TAYLOR	Why, didn't they say?
BARNES	Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
TAYLOR	You want to go back to shuttle work?
BARNES	It's steady, good benefits.

BARNES	You gotta think of your old age.
TAYLOR	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
BARNES	Thank you.

TAYLOR	Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
BARNES	Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?

TAYLOR	What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
BARNES	Uh...

BARNES	I think I can handle it.
TAYLOR	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
BARNES	No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
TAYLOR	Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
BARNES	I can hardly wait.

TAYLOR	Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
BARNES	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.

TAYLOR	If anyone can hear me please respond!
BARNES	That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.

TAYLOR	Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
BARNES	Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
TAYLOR	What is the condition of the bridge?

BARNES	The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
TAYLOR	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
BARNES	Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
TAYLOR	What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
BARNES	Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.

BARNES	Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
TAYLOR	You better start making sense!
BARNES	Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
TAYLOR	Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
BARNES	I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.

TAYLOR	It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
BARNES	Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?

BARNES	Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
TAYLOR	We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
BARNES	Well, preferably in tens and twenties...

BARNES	That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
TAYLOR	Will you transmit the distress signal?

TAYLOR	Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
BARNES	Taylor, you surprise me.

TAYLOR	I don't know what you're talking about!
BARNES	Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?

TAYLOR	Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
BARNES	I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
TAYLOR	Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!

BARNES	Idiot...
TAYLOR	Good help is hard to find...

PILOT	Barnes?
BARNES	That's me.
PILOT	Break it down to me, what's going on?
BARNES	Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
PILOT	Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
BARNES	Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
PILOT	Will do.  What about the distress signal?
BARNES	I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.

PILOT	Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
BARNES	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
PILOT	10-4 good buddy.

PILOT	It's time we lock coordinates.
BARNES	I know, I know.

PILOT	So, what are we waiting for?
BARNES	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
PILOT	Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!

PILOT	You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
BARNES	The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!

BARNES	This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
PILOT	Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
BARNES	Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!

PILOT	Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
BARNES	I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
PILOT	Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
BARNES	Let's get something straight, Chappy!

BARNES	Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
PILOT	This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!

BARNES	Is that clear?
PILOT	That's clear.
BARNES	Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
PILOT	Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
BARNES	Over and out!

CARLO	Look at this...Jesus.
JACK	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
CARLO	No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
JACK	Like that piece of ass he was with.
CARLO	Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
JACK	Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.

CARLO	Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
JACK	I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.

CARLO	What's the use...we're gonna die...
JACK	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!

CARLO	We're going to die.
JACK	Will you shut up already?

CARLO	It's getting hard to breathe...
JACK	Just don't move around too much.

TAYLOR	Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
DAWN	That's right.
TAYLOR	Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
DAWN	Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
TAYLOR	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.

DAWN	So you were looking for a new challenge.
TAYLOR	Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?

TAYLOR	Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
DAWN	Like open an airlock by mistake?
TAYLOR	Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
DAWN	Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
TAYLOR	I'm sure you'll be all right.
DAWN	Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
TAYLOR	Really?
DAWN	Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.

DAWN	What are we going to do?
TAYLOR	I don't know.

TAYLOR	We don't.
DAWN	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
TAYLOR	Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.

DAWN	Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
TAYLOR	Probably come through the wall I suppose.
DAWN	Well maybe we can do something like that.

TAYLOR	I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
DAWN	Just considering our options... sir.

DAWN	Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
TAYLOR	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
DAWN	Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
TAYLOR	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.

DAWN	OK...it's open.
TAYLOR	Seen one like it before?
DAWN	Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
TAYLOR	Great.

TAYLOR	Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
DAWN	Why can't we?
TAYLOR	I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.

TAYLOR	And suppose you couldn't hold out?
DAWN	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?

DAWN	We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
TAYLOR	You're right.

DAWN	He certainly is polite.
TAYLOR	Close every door behind you!

DAWN	It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
TAYLOR	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.

TAYLOR	If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
DAWN	Even if we do, it might be too late.

TAYLOR	Everyone just stay put.
DAWN	Wait.

TAYLOR	I can't let you do that.
DAWN	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
TAYLOR	Simulated space walking.

TAYLOR	I don't know what we're facing.
DAWN	I understand.

TAYLOR	Are you ready?
DAWN	Ready as I'll ever be.

DAWN	Yeah.  We did it.
TAYLOR	So we did.

TAYLOR	You're ready for the real thing?
DAWN	At this point I'm ready for anything.

TAYLOR	Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
DAWN	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?

DAWN	Explosive?
TAYLOR	One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...

DAWN	Taylor?
TAYLOR	Yeah?
DAWN	What do you think's going to happen to us?

TAYLOR	Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
DAWN	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.

TAYLOR	Do you want some advice?
DAWN	Sure.
TAYLOR	Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
DAWN	Words to live by.

TAYLOR	Dawn!  Dawn!
DAWN	Helllp!

DAWN	I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
TAYLOR	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.

DAWN	Oh my God.  What happened?
TAYLOR	The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.

DAWN	What's that?
TAYLOR	A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
DAWN	We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
TAYLOR	That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.

TAYLOR	Take this flare.
DAWN	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
TAYLOR	No...

TAYLOR	A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
DAWN	Why?  Where are you going?

TAYLOR	I'm not going with you.
DAWN	What?  What are you talking about?
TAYLOR	There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.

DAWN	And what are you going to do?!
TAYLOR	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
DAWN	But how are you going to escape?
TAYLOR	Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
DAWN	But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
TAYLOR	I can't!

TAYLOR	I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
DAWN	You too.

TAYLOR	Dawn.  Come in.
DAWN	Taylor!  Where are you?

TAYLOR	I'm in the bridge.
DAWN	Barnes?

TAYLOR	He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
DAWN	I'm about to blow the wall.
TAYLOR	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
DAWN	How does the distress signal look?

TAYLOR	Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
DAWN	I'll do my best.
DAWN	So what's going to happen to you?
TAYLOR	I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
DAWN	Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
TAYLOR	Hopefully sooner than later.
DAWN	Sooner than later.
TAYLOR	Over and out.

TAYLOR	What the hell are you doing?
DAWN	We have room!  Let's go!
TAYLOR	What do you mean?  What happened!
DAWN	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!

DAWN	So close...
TAYLOR	And so far.

DAWN	I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
TAYLOR	It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
DAWN	Except write our wills.

TAYLOR	Will you marry me?
DAWN	Marry you?
TAYLOR	That's right.  Will you marry me?

DAWN	I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
TAYLOR	It would matter to us.

DAWN	In that case, I accept.
TAYLOR	Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.

DAWN	Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
TAYLOR	Try not to think about it.

DAWN	What is it?!
TAYLOR	I don't know.  Wave to them!

DAWN	I'm fine.
MAC	Congratulations on your...recent award.
DAWN	Thank you.
MAC	Is there anything I can help you with?
DAWN	No, just enjoying the view.
MAC	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
DAWN	So I've been told.
MAC	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.

DAWN	Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
MAC	That is one of my priorities.

JACK	What is happening around here!!!
DAWN	There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
JACK	Where's Taylor?
DAWN	He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?

DAWN	Carlo!
JACK	He's in the bathroom.

DAWN	I'm going back for Taylor!
JACK	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!

MONICA	I'm homesick.
DELBERT	Homesick?  It's only been two days!
MONICA	We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
DELBERT	Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
MONICA	How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
DELBERT	Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.

DELBERT	Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
MONICA	I guess so.
DELBERT	Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.

MONICA	Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
DELBERT	Send it back if you don't want it.

MONICA	Well now what are we gonna do!
DELBERT	How am I supposed to know?
MONICA	You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
DELBERT	Talk to him...Jesus...

MONICA	It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
DELBERT	Baby, take it easy.
MONICA	How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!

JACK	Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
DELBERT	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.

JACK	You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
DELBERT	Who are you calling a pig, rummy?

DELBERT	I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
JACK	I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.

DELBERT	Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
JACK	What are you going to do about it?

DELBERT	I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
JACK	Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
DELBERT	What makes you so sure?

DELBERT	What the hell is that?
JACK	The engines!

MAC	Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
TAYLOR	Mac.  What's shaking?

TAYLOR	Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
MAC	Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
TAYLOR	Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
MAC	Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
TAYLOR	Right, I understand that...

TAYLOR	I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
MAC	That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
TAYLOR	Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
MAC	Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
TAYLOR	I know but we're in a bind.

TAYLOR	Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
MAC	One moment please...  one moment please...

TAYLOR	But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
MAC	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.

TAYLOR	Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
MAC	I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.

TAYLOR	Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
MAC	Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.

TAYLOR	How is it looking, Mac?
MAC	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.

TAYLOR	Is it safe for human transport?
MAC	That's affirmative.

ZALTAR	You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
ALURA	But where?

ZALTAR	I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
ALURA	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
ZALTAR	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....

ZALTAR	I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
ALURA	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

ALURA	But the Power Source, Zaltar.
ZALTAR	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
ALURA	But what will happen?
ZALTAR	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...

SELENA	I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
BIANCA	What is it?
SELENA	The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

SELENA	What does it mean?
BIANCA	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

SELENA	Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
BIANCA	Softball.

SELENA	It must be the girls. One of the girls.
BIANCA	But which one?
SELENA	Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.

SELENA	We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
BIANCA	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

SELENA	Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
BIANCA	Sorry, mistress.

BIANCA	Is he your entertainment for tonight?
SELENA	He will be. In about five minutes.
BIANCA	Have fun.

BIANCA	I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
SELENA	It's what we were warned about.

BIANCA	A Storm Dragon?
SELENA	No, a super girl.

SELENA	Why did she have to show up now?
BIANCA	Eliminate her.
SELENA	That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
BIANCA	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
SELENA	Am I? Still?

BIANCA	Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
SELENA	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
BIANCA	That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.

SELENA	What do I do?  I don't know her name.
BIANCA	The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.

SELENA	Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
BIANCA	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

SELENA	I think I'd better keep it.
BIANCA	Whatever you say.
SELENA	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.

BIANCA	Home?
SELENA	No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
BIANCA	Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

BIANCA	Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
SELENA	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

SELENA	I don't feel like it right now.
BIANCA	She didn't take it from you, did she?
SELENA	That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

SELENA	At last. Ultimate Power.
BIANCA	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
SELENA	What do you mean we?

ELDERLY MAN	I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
SELENA	What do you want?
ELDERLY MAN	Western Europe.
SELENA	I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
ELDERLY MAN	No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.

ELDERLY MAN	Is this Nigel's doing?
SELENA	It's a warning, that's for sure.
ELDERLY MAN	Maybe it was just an accident.
SELENA	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.

ETHAN	Wait...don't leave me in here...
SUPERGIRL	It's for your own protection.

ETHAN	What's happening?
SUPERGIRL	I'm taking you to the hospital.
ETHAN	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
SUPERGIRL	Later.

ETHAN	Don't leave me.
SUPERGIRL	I have to.
ETHAN	When can I see, you again ?
SUPERGIRL	Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.

ETHAN	You're alive! She didn't kill you!
SUPERGIRL	Who didn't?
ETHAN	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
SUPERGIRL	You love me?
ETHAN	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
SUPERGIRL	We have to have a long talk about all this.
ETHAN	I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.

ETHAN	This is my favourite place in the city.
SUPERGIRL	Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
ETHAN	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.

ETHAN	Like it?
SUPERGIRL	Yes. It reminds me of home.
ETHAN	Where Superman's from? Krypton?
SUPERGIRL	No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
ETHAN	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
SUPERGIRL	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
ETHAN	Come on, let's ride.

ETHAN	I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
SUPERGIRL	Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
ETHAN	Let's talk about us, not her.
SUPERGIRL	Tell me where I can find her.
ETHAN	I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.

SUPERGIRL	But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
ETHAN	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
SUPERGIRL	We can't do that.
ETHAN	Why not ?
SUPERGIRL	We're from different worlds.
ETHAN	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.

SUPERGIRL	All this talk about love, it's silly.
ETHAN	You don't like me? You hate me?

SUPERGIRL	Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
ETHAN	What do you feel about me?

ETHAN	There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
SUPERGIRL	What's that?
ETHAN	Let me kiss you.
SUPERGIRL	No.
ETHAN	You're not afraid are you?
SUPERGIRL	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
ETHAN	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
SUPERGIRL	Well...I guess one is all right.

SUPERGIRL	Is this how?
ETHAN	Terrific.

SUPERGIRL	I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
ETHAN	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
SUPERGIRL	But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
ETHAN	You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

ETHAN	Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
SUPERGIRL	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

ETHAN	She said it wouldn't last.
SUPERGIRL	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

ETHAN	I don't love you any more.
SUPERGIRL	Just like that?
ETHAN	Like turning off a light.

ETHAN	Away. From you.
SUPERGIRL	But why?
ETHAN	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
SUPERGIRL	I sort of like what you said.
ETHAN	That makes it worse.
SUPERGIRL	But I don't understand.

ETHAN	Hi.
SUPERGIRL	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
ETHAN	I'm not mad at you.
SUPERGIRL	It seemed that way to me.
ETHAN	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
SUPERGIRL	Miss what?
ETHAN	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...

SUPERGIRL	And now?
ETHAN	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...

ETHAN	You think so?
SUPERGIRL	I don't see why not.
ETHAN	But what if---it wasn't real?
SUPERGIRL	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.

ETHAN	Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
SUPERGIRL	Are you asking me for a "date"?
ETHAN	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
SUPERGIRL	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
ETHAN	She'll forget about us eventually.

SUPERGIRL	There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
ETHAN	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

SUPERGIRL	That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
ETHAN	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
SUPERGIRL	I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.

ETHAN	Wait. Don't leave me.
SUPERGIRL	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.

ETHAN	Before you go...
SUPERGIRL	What?
ETHAN	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.

SUPERGIRL	And you can see how you feel about me, right?
ETHAN	Yes.

SUPERGIRL	You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
ETHAN	She has hostages.

ETHAN	It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
SUPERGIRL	How do I fight it?
ETHAN	Turn it against her.

ETHAN	No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
SUPERGIRL	I'll come back as soon as I can.

ETHAN	She's right. They'll string her up.
SUPERGIRL	Do you want to come to Argo City?

LUCY	Hey! Ethan!
ETHAN	Hmmm?
LUCY	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

ETHAN	A little.
LUCY	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
ETHAN	I'll mention it upstairs.

LUCY	Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
ETHAN	I did.
LUCY	Well thanks a pile, fella.

SELENA	Finished your estimate?
ETHAN	Well, there's several ways to go .
SELENA	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

SELENA	You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
ETHAN	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
SELENA	I bet they do.
ETHAN	What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
SELENA	Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.

ETHAN	What is it?
SELENA	A passionfruit smoothee.
ETHAN	Well, just one.

SELENA	To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
ETHAN	I'll drink to that.

ETHAN	Oh no, not you again.
SELENA	What an adorable hat.
ETHAN	They think I have a concussion.
SELENA	And you think you're in love.
ETHAN	I know it.
SELENA	This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
ETHAN	Why should I believe you?
SELENA	It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.

SELENA	Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
ETHAN	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
SELENA	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.

ETHAN	Nurse! Nurse!
SELENA	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
ETHAN	Nurse!
SELENA	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
ETHAN	Nurse! Help !

SELENA	This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
ETHAN	I don't want your help.
SELENA	Come back to my house. My car's outside.

ETHAN	No!
SELENA	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!

ETHAN	I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
SELENA	I could force you.
ETHAN	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
SELENA	Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.

SELENA	You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
ETHAN	You vicious--
SELENA	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.

SELENA	They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
ETHAN	Yeah.

SELENA	Guess! Go on.
ETHAN	I don't know. You seem afraid.
SELENA	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
ETHAN	Supergirl?

SELENA	You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
ETHAN	Well...I guess I can't.
SELENA	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.

ETHAN	Why the empty cage?
SELENA	That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

GEORGE	You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
SELENA	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.

GEORGE	Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
SELENA	Why George, are you proposing?
GEORGE	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
SELENA	George---I thought you'd never ask.

GEORGE	Hey, where you going?
SELENA	I've got things to do.
GEORGE	What about my proposal?
SELENA	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

JIMMY	Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
LINDA	Nice to meet you.

JIMMY	Do you have any theories about last night?
LINDA	Theories?
JIMMY	How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -

LINDA	I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
JIMMY	Can I quote you?

JIMMY	Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
LINDA	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
JIMMY	I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !

JIMMY	Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
LINDA	Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

JIMMY	Can I give you a lift?
LINDA	Oh, no thanks.
JIMMY	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.

LINDA	Someone's chasing him.
JIMMY	Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
LINDA	Yes.
JIMMY	The scoop of the year!

LUCY	Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
JIMMY	-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

LUCY	Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
JIMMY	Oh, sure.

LUCY	I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
JIMMY	How do you know?
LUCY	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
JIMMY	Did anybody notice you?
LUCY	I can't help it if men notice me.
JIMMY	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

JIMMY	I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
LUCY	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
JIMMY	I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.

JIMMY	I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
LUCY	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
JIMMY	You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
LUCY	You bet your ass.
JIMMY	Why didn't you tell me?
LUCY	You're supposed to guess.

KARA	I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
ZOR-EL	But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
KARA	It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
ZOR-EL	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
KARA	I allowed it to escape the City.

ZOR-EL	Superman will return it.
KARA	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-

ZOR-EL	Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
KARA	As brave as my father. As wise.

KARA	What are you making:
ZALTAR	It's going to be a tree, I think.

KARA	What's a tree?
ZALTAR	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
KARA	Where is Earth?
ZALTAR	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
KARA	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.

ZALTAR	Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
KARA	I don't understand.
ZALTAR	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.

ZALTAR	You see, a tree is a living thing.
KARA	Can you create life?

KARA	I'm sorry... I didn't know.
ZALTAR	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

LINDA	I can do that.
LUCY	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

LINDA	There isn't any.
LUCY	This is all your clothes?

LINDA	I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
LUCY	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
LINDA	I'd rather not talk about it.
LUCY	You're not...an orphan are you?
LINDA	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
LUCY	Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
LINDA	Thank you. You're very kind.

LINDA	She did that deliberately.
LUCY	She's a beast.

LUCY	How'd you do that?
LINDA	Must've been a defective puck.

LUCY	Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
LINDA	But what for?
LUCY	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.

LUCY	Your hair looks the same.
LINDA	It was just a trim.

LINDA	No thanks. You go on.
LUCY	You sure?

LUCY	Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
LINDA	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
LUCY	Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
LINDA	It doesn't seem right.
LUCY	Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

LINDA	Why is he acting so strangely?
LUCY	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

LINDA	Lucy; come back!
LUCY	Somebody's gotta do something!!

LINDA	I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
LUCY	Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.

LUCY	Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
LINDA	He's nice.
LUCY	Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!

LUCY	You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
LINDA	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
LUCY	Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

MR. DANVERS	Don't you believe in knocking?
LINDA	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

MR. DANVERS	What can I do for you?
LINDA	I'm Linda Lee.

LINDA	I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
MR. DANVERS	Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

MR. DANVERS	No plans for the weekend, Linda?
LINDA	No, MR. Danvers.
MR. DANVERS	Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
LINDA	I'd love to.

LINDA	Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
MR. DANVERS	What? Me?
LINDA	Sure. Mate in five moves.

SELENA	Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
NIGEL	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
SELENA	I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
NIGEL	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

SELENA	I just did. Because I have the Power.
NIGEL	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.

SELENA	Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
NIGEL	Cigarette?

SELENA	Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
NIGEL	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
SELENA	I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.

NIGEL	Balefire on you, Selena!
SELENA	You Scorpios can never take a joke.

NIGEL	You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
SELENA	Throw him out.

SELENA	Nigel, get lost.
NIGEL	I have to talk to you.
SELENA	You're wasting your breath.
NIGEL	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
SELENA	I could teach you a thing or two now.

NIGEL	...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
SELENA	I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

NIGEL	Nothing's wrong with my skin.
SELENA	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.

NIGEL	You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
SELENA	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.

SELENA	Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
NIGEL	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
SELENA	Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
NIGEL	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
SELENA	Nonsense.

SELENA	That was meant for me!
SUPERGIRL	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

SUPERGIRL	Who are you ?
SELENA	I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
SUPERGIRL	I don't scare that easily.

SUPERGIRL	That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
SELENA	A cheap trick.
SUPERGIRL	Cheap but effective.

SELENA	The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
SUPERGIRL	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

SUPERGIRL	You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
SELENA	Not yet.

SELENA	I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
SUPERGIRL	For what?

SELENA	Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
SUPERGIRL	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.

SELENA	What's it like?
SUPERGIRL	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
SELENA	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.

SELENA	Where is inner space?
SUPERGIRL	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

SUPERGIRL	They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
SELENA	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
SUPERGIRL	That's home.

SUPERGIRL	What is this place?
ZALTAR	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
SUPERGIRL	I was on Earth...
ZALTAR	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
SUPERGIRL	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...

ZALTAR	Shouldnt've done that.
SUPERGIRL	...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
ZALTAR	It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
SUPERGIRL	I know.
ZALTAR	Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.

SUPERGIRL	Others?
ZALTAR	Criminals.

SUPERGIRL	...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
ZALTAR	What? Palace? Hardly.
SUPERGIRL	Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...

SUPERGIRL	It's lovely. . .
ZALTAR	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
SUPERGIRL	Are you happy, Zaltar?
ZALTAR	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
SUPERGIRL	But what about other people? Don't you miss them?

SUPERGIRL	You look at them? How?
ZALTAR	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.

SUPERGIRL	That horrible woman!
ZALTAR	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.

SUPERGIRL	Zaltar, please help me.
ZALTAR	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
SUPERGIRL	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.

ZALTAR	There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
SUPERGIRL	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
ZALTAR	No, that's not true---there's well...no--

ZALTAR	There is a way.
SUPERGIRL	I knew it!
ZALTAR	But it's impossible.
SUPERGIRL	Why?
ZALTAR	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

SUPERGIRL	Then teach me how.
ZALTAR	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.

ZALTAR	Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
SUPERGIRL	Then come with me.
ZALTAR	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
SUPERGIRL	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
ZALTAR	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
SUPERGIRL	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.

SUPERGIRL	You're going to take me back?
ZALTAR	Going to try. Didn't say I could.

SUPERGIRL	I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
ZALTAR	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!

ZALTAR	You can use the wand.
SUPERGIRL	Better than when I was a child.

ZALTAR	What's that? Never saw anything like that.
SUPERGIRL	Don't stop. Keep moving.
ZALTAR	Yes, mustn't stop.
SUPERGIRL	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

SUPERGIRL	Zaltar. Use the wand!
ZALTAR	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

ZALTAR	Goodbye...
SUPERGIRL	Zaltar!

BRAD	Yeah? What do you want?
GUS	Buddy, are we in trouble.

BRAD	What?
GUS	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?

BRAD	What are you talkin' about?
GUS	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
BRAD	Mr. Roebush?
GUS	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
BRAD	Tuesday.
GUS	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!

BRAD	S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
GUS	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
BRAD	Not enough vodka in it.
GUS	There's no vodka in it.
BRAD	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
GUS	What? What did you tell me?

GUS	Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
BRAD	Brad.
GUS	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
BRAD	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
GUS	Brad?
BRAD	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
GUS	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!

GUS	Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
BRAD	Nope.  Never. 

BRAD	Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
CLARK	Brad Wilson.
BRAD	Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!

BRAD	Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
CLARK	I seem to be.

BRAD	All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
CLARK	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
BRAD	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.

CLARK	Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
BRAD	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.

CLARK	I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
BRAD	The kid needs a man to show him --
CLARK	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!

CLARK	Lana Lang. How great to see you.
LANA	Clark.

LANA	You look wonderful.
CLARK	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?

CLARK	You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
LANA	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
CLARK	You're welcome...??
LANA	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?

LANA	I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
CLARK	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.

LANA	You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
CLARK	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --

LANA	And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
CLARK	It sure is.
LANA	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.

LANA	You know what's the problem?
CLARK	Too much mayonnaise?
LANA	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
CLARK	I didn't --
LANA	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
CLARK	But Lana, you could --
LANA	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
CLARK	Who?
LANA	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.

LANA	You...um...you never got married?
CLARK	Oh...I came close once.

LANA	That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
CLARK	You thought that?
LANA	I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.

LANA	I just can't stand this.
CLARK	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
LANA	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
CLARK	But all he had was chocolate milk.
LANA	I mean him.

CLARK	Gee, I haven't done this in years.
LANA	Some people don't think it's healthy.
CLARK	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
LANA	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
CLARK	Me??
LANA	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.

LANA	And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
CLARK	There's a lot of choices here.
LANA	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
CLARK	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!

LANA	Peanut butter and jelly.
CLARK	No, thanks.
LANA	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
CLARK	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
LANA	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.

LANA	Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
CLARK	Me neither...

LANA	So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
CLARK	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --

LANA	I can never get a way from it.
CLARK	Old ties are hard to cut.
LANA	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 

LANA	That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
CLARK	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
LANA	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
CLARK	Call me.
LANA	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.

LANA	The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
CLARK	Can I help?

LANA	He really was!
CLARK	Uh-huh.
LANA	Well, aren't you excited?
CLARK	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

CLARK	Gee, I always loved porch swings.
LANA	Me too. That's why I put this one up.

CLARK	No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
LANA	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.

LANA	I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
CLARK	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
LANA	Anyday...

CLARK	Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
PERRY	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.

CLARK	Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
PERRY	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!

PERRY	I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
CLARK	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.

PERRY	-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
CLARK	Oh. You're going away.

CLARK	Uh...excuse me, folks...
PERRY	Kent!
CLARK	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.

CLARK	Well...  Not quite like this.
RICKY	Mom and I do this all the time.

RICKY	Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
CLARK	What!

RICKY	Do you really know Superman?
CLARK	We get together sometimes.

RICKY	Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
CLARK	Sure.
RICKY	Could you get me Superman's autograph?

RICKY	Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
CLARK	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.

CLARK	Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
LOIS	Say!
CLARK	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --

CLARK	So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
LOIS	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.

CLARK	You're the best, Lois.
LOIS	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
CLARK	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
LOIS	Oh?

CLARK	It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
JIMMY	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

JIMMY	But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
CLARK	Mmmmm . . .
JIMMY	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
CLARK	What's that?

JIMMY	Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
CLARK	At one o'clock in the morning?

JIMMY	Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
CLARK	What are you doing?
JIMMY	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.

CLERK	Name?
GUS	Gus Gorman.

CLERK	Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
GUS	Yeah.
CLERK	What kind?
GUS	Kitchen. . . Technician
CLERK	Dishwasher? Any luck?
GUS	Nope, but --
CLERK	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
GUS	Thirty-five.
CLERK	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
GUS	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
CLERK	A television set?
GUS	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
CLERK	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
GUS	Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
CLERK	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
GUS	I know, I'm the fault.
CLERK	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
GUS	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
CLERK	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
GUS	What about this week's check?

GUS	Sonofagun! Look at this here!
FRED	First paycheck?
GUS	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
FRED	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
GUS	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.

FRED	Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
GUS	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
FRED	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
GUS	Who gets it, the company?
FRED	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
GUS	So where is all them half-centses?
FRED	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.

FRED	How many sugars?
GUS	One.  And a half.

FRED	Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
GUS	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
FRED	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
GUS	Yeah. A raise . .

FRED	Gus?
GUS	Say what?
FRED	The boss wants to see you.
GUS	Say who?

GUS	Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
ROSS	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...

ROSS	You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
GUS	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...

ROSS	Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
GUS	Uh...
ROSS	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
GUS	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

ROSS	I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
GUS	Or socks.
ROSS	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
GUS	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?

ROSS	Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
GUS	I'm tryin' to.

ROSS	Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
GUS	Black or regular?
ROSS	I don't think you understand.

GUS	Man, what is this?
ROSS	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.

ROSS	Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
GUS	Decaffeinated too?

ROSS	But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
GUS	Which country?
ROSS	Columbia.
GUS	Columbia.
ROSS	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 

GUS	Wipe 'em out?
ROSS	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.

GUS	But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
ROSS	A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
GUS	Me? How?

ROSS	Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
GUS	That what they call you?

GUS	How do you do that?
ROSS	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.

ROSS	Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
GUS	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
ROSS	When?
GUS	First question got to be "Where."
ROSS	What?
GUS	Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.

GUS	Hey, boss.
ROSS	Just the man I wanted to see!
GUS	Turn on the T.V.
ROSS	I did. isn't it neat-o?
GUS	Uh...what channel were you watching?
ROSS	What are you talking about, fella?

GUS	It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
ROSS	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.

GUS	Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
ROSS	God, that's what I keep you for.
GUS	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
ROSS	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
GUS	Greed!  Let me tell you something---

GUS	He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
ROSS	KRYPTONITE!
GUS	Huh?

ROSS	Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
GUS	They ain't got captains?
ROSS	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.

ROSS	And do nothing. Just sit there.
GUS	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
ROSS	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.

ROSS	And then shut down the pipe lines.
GUS	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
ROSS	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?

GUS	Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
ROSS	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
GUS	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.

GUS	Now...when do I get a taste?
ROSS	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
GUS	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.

ROSS	Is this blackmail?
GUS	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
ROSS	Is this whitemail?
GUS	Fair's fair.
ROSS	What do you want?

ROSS	A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
ROSS	For what?
GUS	A computer.
ROSS	We've already got some.
GUS	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
ROSS	You designed it?
GUS	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
ROSS	What will it do?
GUS	Everything.
ROSS	What will it get me?
GUS	Anything.
ROSS	Tell me more...

GUS	Yeah? How's it look?
ROSS	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
GUS	I told you it wasn't no jive.
ROSS	Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
GUS	Stone mutha.
ROSS	Exactly. Stoned mother.

ROSS	But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
GUS	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
ROSS	Can you do that?
GUS	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...

ROSS	Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
GUS	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.

GUS	You want to mess with Superman?
ROSS	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.

GUS	Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
ROSS	Join the party, genius! Come on up!

SUPERMAN	How you doing down there?
GUS	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
SUPERMAN	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
GUS	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
SUPERMAN	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
GUS	Watch out for them air pockets!
SUPERMAN	No, we're just going down.
GUS	We gonna crash?
SUPERMAN	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
GUS	We back in Metropolis?
SUPERMAN	No...I just have a little stop to make.

GUS	Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
SUPERMAN	Just a second.

SUPERMAN	Thanks.  Let's go
GUS	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
SUPERMAN	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?

GUS	Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
VERA	Sister! I'm his sister!

GUS	Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
VERA	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
GUS	What she call you?

VERA	You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
GUS	And do what?

GUS	I know, by computers.
VERA	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.

PERRY	Who is she?
JIMMY	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.

PERRY	Who's the other woman?
JIMMY	That's his sister. Vera Webster.

PERRY	You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
JIMMY	I didn't have my camera with me.
PERRY	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --

PERRY	All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
JIMMY	What about me?
PERRY	What about you?
JIMMY	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!

JIMMY	Why do I have to do this?
PERRY	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
JIMMY	It was hot!

LANA	Ricky?  Where...what...
SUPERMAN	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
LANA	Thank ...you.
SUPERMAN	Anytime.

LANA	Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
SUPERMAN	We've already met.
LANA	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
SUPERMAN	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.

SUPERMAN	You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
LANA	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.

LANA	He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
SUPERMAN	You just did, with that great dinner.

SUPERMAN	There's no rush.
LANA	But the bridge...
SUPERMAN	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.

SUPERMAN	It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
LANA	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
SUPERMAN	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!

PERRY	The picture looks blurry.
LOIS	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.

LOIS	What terrific story?
PERRY	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
LOIS	Whoopee.

LOIS	Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
PERRY	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.

PERRY	Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
LOIS	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

LORELEI	I thought you'd never get here.
SUPERMAN	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
LORELEI	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.

LORELEI	Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
SUPERMAN	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?

LORELEI	Lots of things...
SUPERMAN	Tell me.

LORELEI	I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
SUPERMAN	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
LORELEI	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
SUPERMAN	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
LORELEI	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...

SUPERMAN	I don't know you, lady.
LORELEI	But the other night...
SUPERMAN	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.

LORELEI	Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
VERA	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!

VERA	If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
LORELEI	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.

VERA	Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
LORELEI	Diet soda?
VERA	Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.

VERA	How would you know?
LORELEI	Hey, I know a lot of things!
VERA	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.

VERA	At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
LORELEI	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?

LORELEI	I can't see anything.
VERA	Turn on the light.
LORELEI	Where's the light switch?
VERA	Where do you usually find a light switch?

VERA	Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
LORELEI	Gus?
VERA	Superman. The boy you left behind.

VERA	You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
LORELEI	In other words, push this red button.

LORELEI	Oh, Superman!
VERA	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
LORELEI	He can have mine. Anytime.

VERA	I can't! It's out of control!
LORELEI	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
PERRY	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
MISS HENDERSON	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.

PERRY	53.
MISS HENDERSON	53!

PERRY	Okay? Goodbye.
MISS HENDERSON	You've got to pick three more numbers.

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, the next number, please?
PERRY	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
MISS HENDERSON	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
PERRY	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
PERRY	Why do I have to do this?

MISS HENDERSON	It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
PERRY	Where's the handle?
MISS HENDERSON	There is no handle! You just push a button.

SIMPSON	85,000 dollars.
ROSS	Missing????
SIMPSON	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.

SIMPSON	I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
ROSS	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

ROSS	Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
SIMPSON	Hello.

ROSS	Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
SIMPSON	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

VERA	That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
ROSS	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.

VERA	I don't kiss.
ROSS	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.

ROSS	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
VERA	It could make weather!
ROSS	Storms! Floods!
VERA	Blizzards! Heat waves!

ROSS	Computers talk to other computers, right?
VERA	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

VERA	She's not his mama either.
ROSS	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.

VERA	Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
ROSS	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...

ROSS	You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
VERA	Today coffee----
ROSS	TOMORROW THE OIL!

VERA	Small potatoes.
ROSS	We already have a super-tanker.
VERA	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
ROSS	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

ROSS	He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
VERA	Don't cry, Bubba.

ROSS	Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
VERA	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...

ROSS	Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
VERA	What's wrong?
ROSS	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
VERA	Where did it come from?
ROSS	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.

VERA	So?
ROSS	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--

ROSS	Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
VERA	A normal person.
ROSS	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
VERA	We can get to work on that oil!

ROSS	That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
VERA	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?

VERA	Come on, let's give it a dry run.
ROSS	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
VERA	Who needs Gus?

ROSS	He's the only one who can operate this --
VERA	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!

ROSS	He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
VERA	Don't bet on it!

VERA	Yes! This time we got it right!
ROSS	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.

LACY	It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
CLARK	I really don't think . . .
LACY	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
CLARK	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
LACY	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...

CLARK	They make my eyes itch.
LACY	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!

LACY	You're late. Very late.
CLARK	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
LACY	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.

CLARK	I've never been in a place like this before.
LACY	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.

LACY	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
CLARK	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.

LACY	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
CLARK	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
LACY	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.

CLARK	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
LACY	What about here?
CLARK	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
LACY	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
CLARK	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
LACY	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.

LACY	I feel kind of light-headed . . .
CLARK	Don't worry, I've got you.

CLARK	Maybe I should sit this one out.
LACY	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!

LACY	Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
CLARK	If you say so. Here goes.

LACY	He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
CLARK	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.

LACY	Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
CLARK	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
LACY	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.

CLARK	Gee, I don't think . . .
LACY	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.

CLARK	Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
LACY	. . . Let me get my purse.

LACY	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
CLARK	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.

LACY	I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
CLARK	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.

CLARK	Oh . . . my . . .
LACY	Clark. . . !

CLARK	Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
LACY	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.

CLARK	Gee, I'm really sorry.
LACY	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.

LACY	Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
CLARK	I'm sorry to see you go.
LACY	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
CLARK	I'm not so sure you do.
LACY	Any more like you back home, Clark?
CLARK	Like me?
LACY	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.

CLARK	You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
LACY	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
CLARK	Lacy. . . I . . .

LOIS	Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
CLARK	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
LOIS	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!

LOIS	No Paris?
CLARK	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
LOIS	Clark . . . wait!

CLARK	The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
LOIS	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?

CLARK	Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
LOIS	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.

CLARK	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
LOIS	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
CLARK	Politely?

CLARK	. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
LOIS	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?

CLARK	It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
LOIS	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?

CLARK	Superman? Has something happened to him?
LOIS	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
CLARK	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.

LOIS	It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
CLARK	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.

HOWLER	Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
LEX	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
HOWLER	But Superman isn't an average man.
LEX	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.

LEX	Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
HOWLER	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
LEX	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.

HOWLER	And what do we get out of it?
LEX	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.

HOWLER	Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
LEX	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.

JEREMY	Impossible? Why?
SUPERMAN	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
JEREMY	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
SUPERMAN	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.

JEREMY	Well, I don't understand.
SUPERMAN	I'm sorry.

SUPERMAN	Would you mind taking a walk with me?
JEREMY	Absolutely!

SUPERMAN	Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
JEREMY	N-no...I mean...you bet.

JEREMY	Awesome!
SUPERMAN	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
JEREMY	I'll try. . .

JEREMY	Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
SUPERMAN	Go on . . .
JEREMY	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
SUPERMAN	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.

LACY	Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
WARFIELD	Mr. White, come with me I want to see

LACY	Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
WARFIELD	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
LACY	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
WARFIELD	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?

WARFIELD	Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
LACY	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
WARFIELD	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
LACY	Daddy . . . ?
WARFIELD	Yes, darling?
LACY	Stuff it.

WARFIELD	Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
LACY	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
WARFIELD	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.

LACY	No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
WARFIELD	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?

LACY	Is he for real?
LOIS	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.

LACY	I think he's kind of cute.
LOIS	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.

LACY	But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
LOIS	. . . And  very naïve!

LOIS	This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
LACY	Superman gets mail here?

LACY	I think there's an angle.
LOIS	An angle?
LACY	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.

LACY	I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
LOIS	Who?
LACY	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
LOIS	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
LACY	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.

LOIS	And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
LACY	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
LOIS	But he's never there.
LACY	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?

LACY	What's he going to say?
LOIS	Something . . . wonderful.

LACY	What's that?
LOIS	Our other dinner guest.

LOIS	Where's Clark?
LACY	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
LOIS	It always is with Clark.

LENNY	Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
LEX	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!

LEX	Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
LENNY	A toupee that flies?
LEX	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
LENNY	But why the hair?
LEX	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!

LENNY	He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
LEX	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.

LENNY	Whoa. . .
LEX	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .

LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
LEX	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .

LENNY	Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
LEX	I must have miscalculated. How. . .

LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
LEX	Get the box, nephew.

LENNY	Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
LEX	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
LENNY	The one Superman wrecked up?
LEX	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
LENNY	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
LEX	There!

LENNY	Hey! He looks . . . normal.
LEX	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.

LEX	Hey! Just remember I made you.
LENNY	You're just an experiment, freako!

LEX	What was that about?
LENNY	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
LEX	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.

LEX	He's . . . cold. . .
LENNY	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.

LEX	Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
LENNY	What?

LENNY	Boy, are you gonna get it.
LEX	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.

LENNY	We'll all fry.
LEX	This wasn't in the plan.
LENNY	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.

LEX	Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
LENNY	Ready, Uncle Lex?
LEX	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.

LENNY	You think he'll find us.
LEX	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
LENNY	Lucky I brought my drums.

NUCLEAR MAN	What I need this for?
LEX	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

LEX	I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . .
LEX	What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.

NUCLEAR MAN	I am an experiment? I am freako?
LEX	I made you, and I can destroy you.

NUCLEAR MAN	Destroy Superman!
LEX	Wait! Not yet! Back!

LEX	Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
NUCLEAR MAN	First, I have fun.

LEX	Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
NUCLEAR MAN	What do you fear?
LEX	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
NUCLEAR MAN	Destiny.

LEX	Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
NUCLEAR MAN	I am master now.

LEX	Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
SUPERMAN	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
LEX	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!

SUPERMAN	If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
LEX	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
SUPERMAN	It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
LEX	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.

LEX	Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
SUPERMAN	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!

SUPERMAN	Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
LEX	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.

SUPERMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
LEX	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
SUPERMAN	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
LEX	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
SUPERMAN	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
LEX	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
SUPERMAN	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.

LEX	Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
SUPERMAN	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?

SUPERMAN	I'll deal with you later.
LEX	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.

LEX	But . . . how could you beat him?
SUPERMAN	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.

LEX	But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
SUPERMAN	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.

BEV	May I help you?
REILLY	I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
BEV	They're not here.
REILLY	Where are they?
BEV	And you are...?
REILLY	Officer Reilly, vice.
BEV	There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
REILLY	-Where?
BEV	f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
REILLY	Thanks.

BEV	Hey, that's the guy-
REILLY	We just got a bomb threat upstairs.

REILLY	How's the print coming?
BEV	One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
REILLY	Damn.

BEV	Coffee, Mike?
REILLY	No thanks, Bev.

REILLY	Dispatch, this is Reilly.
DISPATCHER VOICE	Go ahead.
REILLY	Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
DISPATCHER VOICE	Aren't you on suspension?
REILLY	Just do it.
DISPATCHER VOICE	Hang on.

GLASS	Who the heck're you?
REILLY	You the Bomb Squad?

GLASS	Where did you get this?
REILLY	Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

GLASS	High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
REILLY	What do you mean?

GLASS	Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
REILLY	Thanks.

GLASS	Alright, let's check it out.
REILLY	We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.

REILLY	What're you talking about?
GLASS	When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
REILLY	We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?

REILLY	What was-? Why...?
GLASS	That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

REILLY	What?
GLASS	This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
REILLY	Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS	Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.

GLASS	By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
REILLY	Mike Reilly.

GLASS	We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
REILLY	So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
GLASS	Treat. We treat devices.
REILLY	Anything else I should know?
GLASS	Don't push it, slick.

GLASS	I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
REILLY	She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
GLASS	Only once, at Redstone.
REILLY	Where...?

GLASS	Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
REILLY	Hey, look--
GLASS	No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
REILLY	Oh yeah? Prove it.
GLASS	Drive.

REILLY	The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
GLASS	Then let's go see what they missed.

GLASS	So what were they doing here?
REILLY	I don't know. You tell me?
GLASS	An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
REILLY	You mentioned something called Redstone.
GLASS	Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
REILLY	Cream of the crop, huh? You?
GLASS	Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
REILLY	Sounds like terrorist heaven.
GLASS	There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
REILLY	Just how easy is it to build a... device?
GLASS	With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?

GLASS	Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
REILLY	Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
GLASS	No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.

GLASS	This is where the van was parked.
REILLY	Yep.
GLASS	Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
REILLY	Look, it's a longshot...
GLASS	Bingo!

REILLY	Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
GLASS	Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...

GLASS	How long are we going to stay?
REILLY	`Til we get a better lead.

GLASS	Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
REILLY	What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
GLASS	Right.
REILLY	Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.

REILLY	You guys seem pretty tight.
GLASS	We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
REILLY	Why do you do it?
GLASS	I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 

REILLY	So cut both.
GLASS	One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
REILLY	Which one's which?
GLASS	I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

GLASS	How long were you hooked?
REILLY	What?
GLASS	You don't have to talk about it.

REILLY	Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
GLASS	Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
REILLY	I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
GLASS	Your partner?
REILLY	I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.

REILLY	I terrible with mechanical things.
GLASS	No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.

REILLY	It's working.
GLASS	Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.

GLASS	Ex-girlfriend?
REILLY	Be right back.

GLASS	What's up?
REILLY	Where you guys at?
GLASS	Driving in circles, waiting for-
REILLY	Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
GLASS	How do you know?
REILLY	Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
GLASS	Should we head for the Interstate?
REILLY	Would you?
GLASS	No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
REILLY	Me, too.

REILLY	Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
GLASS	You got it.

REILLY	Fuck factor?
GLASS	Off the scale.
REILLY	What do we do?

REILLY	Talk to me. Let's assess.
GLASS	Right.

REILLY	C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
GLASS	He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.

GLASS	Good, now the other side.
REILLY	Nothing.
GLASS	Okay, let's go in.

REILLY	Keep talking.
GLASS	Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.

REILLY	Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
GLASS	Don't touch that.

REILLY	More metal... sharp edge...
GLASS	Stay to your left.

REILLY	Something round, two wires ...
GLASS	That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
REILLY	What's wrong?
GLASS	Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
REILLY	Make up your mind, trigger.

REILLY	Yeah, another round thing.
GLASS	Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
REILLY	Which one's which?
GLASS	I don't know.
REILLY	What... ?
GLASS	When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
REILLY	How the hell do you feel yellow?
GLASS	No excuses, just do it!

POOCH	Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
GLASS	Easy, guys.  

POOCH	What do you think?
GLASS	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
POOCH	Right.
GLASS	T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.

POOCH	Whadaya mean?
GLASS	It's from an IRA.
POOCH	Oh shit...

GLASS	Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
POOCH	Punks, huh?
GLASS	Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.

POOCH	You got it.
GLASS	We work fast enough for you?

GLASS	Political.
POOCH	Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 

GLASS	Any word?
POOCH	Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.

T.J.	No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
GLASS	We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.

GLASS	Bev, you're the greatest...
T.J.	Hey, I'm next.

T.J.	Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
GLASS	Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?

T.J.	We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
GLASS	Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.

GLASS	C4, plastic explosive.
T.J.	Helluva fuck factor.

T.J.	Computer device?
GLASS	Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.

T.J.	Glass, what is it?
GLASS	I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.

GLASS	Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
T.J.	Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...

T.J.	Lane oil...
GLASS	A bowling alley.

T.J.	What do ay say?
GLASS	Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.

GLASS	Alright!
T.J.	We've created a monster.

T.J.	Jesus...
GLASS	Reilly! He's loaded!

MARY	Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
REILLY	Who is he?
MARY	Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
REILLY	Taylor's dead.

MARY	There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
REILLY	Thank you.
MARY	He's my brother...

REILLY	Then why tell me?
MARY	People are dying.

SWAN	You okay?
MARY	Alex-
SWAN	I know. I warned them.

MARY	What is that?
SWAN	Security.

SWAN	What's the matter?
MARY	Nothing... just tired.

MARY	Why are we stopping here?
SWAN	We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.

MARY	No... No more killing.
SWAN	Stay here.
MARY	Alex, please.
SWAN	Stay in the truck.

SWAN	Who are you calling, sis?
MARY	What? Nobody, I-

MARY	Alex, please-
SWAN	Shut up!  Who is this?

SWAN	Drop it.
MARY	Take him!

REILLY	I want to work this.
PLUCHINSKY	You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
REILLY	But sir--

REILLY	Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
PLUCHINSKY	Maybe she knows your old man.

PLUCHINSKY	What the hell was that?
REILLY	A ticking bomb...

REILLY	You touch me again and--
PLUCHINSKY	And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.

PLUCHINSKY	You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
REILLY	I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.

WINTERS	Prints?
PLUCHINSKY	Nothing so far.
WINTERS	What about the ballistics report?
PLUCHINSKY	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

PLUCHINSKY	It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
WINTERS	We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.

WINTERS	What the hell's going on?
PLUCHINSKY	Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
WINTERS	Reilly, what're you doing here?

PLUCHINSKY	I'm filing charges against that mother-
WINTERS	Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.

POOCH	He is!
REILLY	Look, it's important.

POOCH	Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
REILLY	What kind of bomb was it?

POOCH	Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
REILLY	Insurance?

POOCH	How're you guys doing?
REILLY	Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.

REILLY	Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
POOCH	Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.

T.J.	That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
POOCH	No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.

T.J.	Vice... Jesus.
POOCH	That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.

T.J.	Pooch, can you move it?
POOCH	I don't know...

POOCH	Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
T.J.	Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.

T.J.	Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
POOCH	Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?

T.J.	That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
POOCH	Shit. We're fucked.

POOCH	Oh shit...
T.J.	Fuck factor ten.

RICE	Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
REILLY	Look who's talking, old man.
RICE	C'mon, it's a quiet night.

RICE	Next week we work the park.
REILLY	I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
RICE	You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...

REILLY	So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
RICE	Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
REILLY	You don't fish.
RICE	How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
REILLY	You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
RICE	One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
REILLY	No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.

RICE	Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
REILLY	What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
RICE	I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
REILLY	She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
RICE	What was it this time?
REILLY	She wanted to cook me breakfast.

RICE	We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
REILLY	Nah, let's just take a look-see.

RICE	You okay?
REILLY	Yeah, just a nick ...

RICE	Mike...
REILLY	Don't talk.
RICE	Take your time... one day at a time, kid...

REILLY	It don't work-
RICE	Ain't that a shit--

REILLY	Reilly, Vice. I-
T.J.	Quiet!

T.J.	Make an appointment.
REILLY	It's about this.

T.J.	P.E.T.N ...
REILLY	What?

T.J.	Vice cop on a homicide?
REILLY	Captain assigned me to assist you.

T.J.	Device.
REILLY	Huh?

REILLY	A what?
T.J.	IRA - instant retirement account.

T.J.	Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
REILLY	You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?

REILLY	T.J., what're you doing?
T.J.	My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?

T.J.	So what're we looking for?
REILLY	Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
T.J.	In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.

REILLY	Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
T.J.	He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.

REILLY	Nice to be here.
T.J.	That feeling won't last long.

REILLY	Captain...
WINTERS	Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
REILLY	Sir, I--

WINTERS	Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
REILLY	I'll do it.

WINTERS	What?
REILLY	It's detonation cord, for a bomb.

REILLY	I'll do it.
WINTERS	Goddamit, Reilly--
REILLY	Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
WINTERS	I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
REILLY	Yes, sir.

REILLY	Sir...
WINTERS	I thought I told you--

WINTERS	What's this?
REILLY	Report on the case so far.
WINTERS	You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
REILLY	Yes, sir.
WINTERS	But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?

REILLY	Yes, sir.
WINTERS	She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
REILLY	I didn't. But I had to try.

WINTERS	Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
REILLY	My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
WINTERS	Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
REILLY	I promised her she'd be safe.
WINTERS	It's our only option.
REILLY	It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
WINTERS	Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
REILLY	I know.
WINTERS	You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.

WINTERS	Reilly, what the hell are you-?
REILLY	Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
WINTERS	Pull back. You're only an observer.

WINTERS	Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
REILLY	We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!

SYBOK	Qual se tu?
BEING	It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
SYBOK	It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
BEING	Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
SYBOK	We sought only your infinite wisdom.
BEING	And how did you breach the Barrier?
SYBOK	With a starship!
BEING	This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
SYBOK	It could. Yes.
BEING	Then I shall make use of this starship.
SYBOK	It will be your chariot!

SYBOK	He has his doubts...
BEING	You doubt me?

SYBOK	Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
BEING	He doubts me.

SYBOK	No, no, it's not possible.
BEING	Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
SYBOK	The ship....
BEING	Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.

SYBOK	I couldn't help but notice you pain.
BEING	My pain?
SYBOK	It runs deep. Share it with me.

UHURA	Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
CHEKOV	Rescued at last.
UHURA	Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.

CHEKOV	Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
UHURA	Is there a problem, gentlemen?

UHURA	My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
CHEKOV	Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
UHURA	Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.

CHEKOV	Admit it. We're lost.
SULU	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.

SULU	Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
CHEKOV	And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.

CHEKOV	Sulu, what are you doing?
SULU	Plotting our new course.
CHEKOV	New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
SULU	Pavel.

CHEKOV	Following new course. Warp seven.
SULU	Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.

SULU	In firing position. Torpedo armed.
CHEKOV	But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.

SCOTTY	Shuttle en route.
CHEKOV	Position, Bird of Prey?
SCOTTY	Closing.

SCOTTY	Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
CHEKOV	Raise shields.
SCOTTY	But the shuttle-
CHEKOV	DO it. Go to Red Alert.

CHEKOV	What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
SCOTTY	I don't have a clue.

CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is the Starship Enterprise.
SYBOK	A Federation starship.
CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
SYBOK	Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?

CHEKOV'S IMAGE	You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
SYBOK	Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
CHEKOV'S IMAGE	We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.

SYBOK	What's going on?
CHEKOV'S IMAGE	I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
SYBOK	Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.

KIRK	Can we have it quiet?
COMMANDERS IMAGE	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
KIRK	Bob?
COMMANDERS IMAGE	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?

KIRK	You caught me on my way to the shower.
COMMANDERS IMAGE	I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
KIRK	On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
COMMANDERS IMAGE	The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.

COMMANDERS IMAGE	The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
KIRK	With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
COMMANDERS IMAGE	Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
KIRK	Oh, please.
COMMANDERS IMAGE	Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
KIRK	Have the Klingons responded?
COMMANDERS IMAGE	No, but you can bet they will.
KIRK	Understood. Kirk out.

RIDER	Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
J'ONN	It's all I have.

RIDER	Your pain runs deep.
J'ONN	What do you know of my pain?
RIDER	Let us explore it together.

J'ONN	Where did you get this power?
RIDER	The power was within you.
J'ONN	I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
RIDER	Join my quest.
J'ONN	What is it you seek?
RIDER	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
J'ONN	A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
RIDER	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
J'ONN	But how?
RIDER	Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.

KIRK	You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
SCOTTY	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
KIRK	Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
SCOTTY	Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...

SCOTTY	Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
KIRK	I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.

SCOTTY	Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
KIRK	Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.

SCOTTY	Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
KIRK	If we could send a distress signal...

KIRK	Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
SCOTTY	Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
KIRK	Mr. Scott, you're amazing.

SCOTTY	She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
KIRK	Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!

UHURA	Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
KIRK	Why didn't you beep my communicator?
UHURA	ER... You forgot to take it with you.

UHURA	Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
KIRK	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?

UHURA	Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
KIRK	Put it on the screen.

KIRK	Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
UHURA	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
KIRK	Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
UHURA	Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
KIRK	Transporter room. Status.

UHURA	Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
KIRK	Go, Sulu.

KIRK	Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
SPOCK	I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.

SPOCK	I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
KIRK	I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
SPOCK	And that is?
KIRK	Because it's there.
SPOCK	Ah, Captain?
KIRK	MM.?
SPOCK	I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.

KIRK	On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
SPOCK	I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

SPOCK	Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
KIRK	Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...

KIRK	Oh, God
SPOCK	Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.

KIRK	Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
SPOCK	I don't understand.
KIRK	I've always known... I'll die alone.

KIRK	What are you doing?
SPOCK	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

SPOCK	Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
KIRK	That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?

KIRK	Pack Up Your Troubles.
SPOCK	Are we leaving, Captain?

KIRK	Row, row, row your boat... I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
SPOCK	That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
KIRK	The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.

KIRK	Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
SPOCK	I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.

SPOCK	Captain?
KIRK	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
SPOCK	Jim.
KIRK	Yes, Spock?
SPOCK	Life is not a dream.
KIRK	Go to sleep, Spock.
SPOCK	Yes, Captain.
KIRK	Goodnight, Bones.

KIRK	Goodnight, Spock.
SPOCK	Goodnight, Doctor.

KIRK	I could use a shower.
SPOCK	Yes.

KIRK	Not General Korrd.
SPOCK	The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
KIRK	General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.

KIRK	What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
SPOCK	Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.

KIRK	Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
SPOCK	I cannot be certain.
KIRK	But he does seem familiar?
SPOCK	He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

SPOCK	I do not often think of the past.
KIRK	Who is it he reminds you of?
SPOCK	There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
KIRK	What do you mean?
SPOCK	The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

SPOCK	He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
KIRK	Why?
SPOCK	He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.

SPOCK	When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
KIRK	Fascinating.

SPOCK	Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
KIRK	Damn.  Let's go.

SPOCK	Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
KIRK	That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
SPOCK	To land any closer would risk detection.
KIRK	Mr. Sulu. Execute.

SPOCK	At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
KIRK	We don't have 1.2 hours.

KIRK	Spock.
SPOCK	Yes, Captain?
KIRK	Be one with the horse.
SPOCK	Yes, Captain.

SPOCK	Exactly 15.5 seconds.
KIRK	An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.

SPOCK	You must allow us to act.
KIRK	Let me do something.

KIRK	Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
SPOCK	Captain, what have I done -
KIRK	What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
SPOCK	Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
KIRK	Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
SPOCK	If you think it would help.

KIRK	You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
SPOCK	If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
KIRK	I ordered you to defend this ship.
SPOCK	You ordered me to kill my brother.
KIRK	Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
SPOCK	No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.

KIRK	You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
SPOCK	I did not.
KIRK	You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
SPOCK	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
KIRK	There, you see? See?
SPOCK	I have a half brother.
KIRK	I gotta sit down.

SPOCK	Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
KIRK	Why didn't you tell me this before?
SPOCK	I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
KIRK	He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...

KIRK	There's got to be a way out of this place.
SPOCK	This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
KIRK	How do you know?
SPOCK	The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
KIRK	This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
SPOCK	He did have pointed ears.

SPOCK	Is it possible?
KIRK	Is what possible?
SPOCK	That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

SPOCK	There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
KIRK	But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
SPOCK	Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
KIRK	Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
SPOCK	I am here, Captain.
KIRK	That's a little vague, Spock -

KIRK	You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
SPOCK	A "t."
KIRK	a... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.

KIRK	New word. "b".. "a"... um...
SPOCK	c.... "k."

SPOCK	There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
KIRK	The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.

SPOCK	I believe I have found a faster way.
KIRK	Hmmm?
SPOCK	Uh-uh.

SPOCK	It would appear we are too heavy.
KIRK	It must be all those marsh melons.

KIRK	Spock... the booster rockets.
SPOCK	If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
KIRK	Fire the rockets!

KIRK	Spock.
SPOCK	The emergency channel, open.
KIRK	To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.

SPOCK	...mark two.
KIRK	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.

KIRK	Spock... don't.
SPOCK	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.

KIRK	What is this?
SPOCK	I believe we are witnessing my birth.

KIRK	Spock?
SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Captain.

KIRK	Spock, I thought I was going to die.
SPOCK	Not possible. You were never alone.

KIRK	Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
SPOCK	I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
KIRK	Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.

SYBOK	I must have your starship.
KIRK	You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?

SYBOK	Who are you?
KIRK	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
SYBOK	But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?

SYBOK	No! No reply. Remain on course.
KIRK	Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-

SYBOK	What are you doing?
KIRK	In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.

SYBOK	We must change our course at once.
KIRK	I'll take you to the bridge.

SYBOK	I trust your message was received?
KIRK	You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
SYBOK	What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
KIRK	I'm afraid of nothing.

SYBOK	Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
KIRK	The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
SYBOK	I don't control minds. I free them.

KIRK	Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
SYBOK	I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?

KIRK	No... I didn't.
SYBOK	Now learn something about yourself.
KIRK	No. I refuse.

KIRK	Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
SYBOK	But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
KIRK	Your vision?
SYBOK	Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
KIRK	You are mad!
SYBOK	Am I? We'll see.

KIRK	About the ship...
SYBOK	The ship needs its Captain.
KIRK	No special conditions?
SYBOK	No conditions.
KIRK	What makes you think I won't turn us around?
SYBOK	Because you, too, must know.

SYBOK	What have I done?
KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
SYBOK	Spock...





KLAA	  







SCOTTY	Borgus Frat.
SCOTTY	Let's see what she's got, said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
UHURA	I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
SCOTTY	Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
UHURA	And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
SCOTTY	Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
UHURA	I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.

SCOTTY	They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
UHURA	Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?

UHURA	Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
SCOTTY	Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
UHURA	Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
SCOTTY	He's not?
UHURA	No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.

UHURA	No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
SCOTTY	Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.

SYBOK	Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
SPOCK	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
SYBOK	I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.

SPOCK	I am a Starfleet Officer.
SYBOK	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.

SPOCK	Sybok, you must surrender.
SYBOK	No. You must kill me.

SYBOK	Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
SPOCK	No. I will not.
SYBOK	You know I'm right.

SYBOK	Each man's pain is unique.
SPOCK	I hide no pain.
SYBOK	I know you better than that.
SPOCK	Do you?

SYBOK	Spock?
SPOCK	I cannot go with you.
SYBOK	Why not?
SPOCK	I belong here.
SYBOK	I don't understand...
SPOCK	Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.

SPOCK	Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
SYBOK	I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!

SPOCK	Sybok.
SYBOK	This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
SPOCK	Sybok, we must find a way...
SYBOK	No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

ALEXIEV	) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
PARKER	Can you tell us what's on the disc?
ALEXIEV	) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.

PARKER	In English, please.
ALEXIEV	I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.

ALEXIEV	It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
PARKER	It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
ALEXIEV	Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.

PARKER	You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
ALEXIEV	Me? What did I do?

PARKER	I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
ALEXIEV	I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
PARKER	Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.

COX	My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
DEANE	Why wasn't I told?

COX	We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
DEANE	You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
COX	Whatever.

COX	Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
DEANE	Catch him and your record's clean.

DEANE	This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
COX	If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
DEANE	Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?

COX	There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
DEANE	But only you will know he's not human.

DEANE	What are they doing in Los Feliz?
COX	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
DEANE	Why would they be going there?
COX	I don't know.
DEANE	I wish we could hear them.

COX	Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
DEANE	He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
COX	Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
DEANE	You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?

COX	You all right?
PARKER	Why'd.. .you pull me out?
COX	Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,

COX	What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
PARKER	He was a computer program for crissake.
COX	You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
PARKER	Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
COX	Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
PARKER	I'm getting by.

PARKER	But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
COX	Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
PARKER	You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
COX	What about them?
PARKER	Do me a favor  keep sending them.

PARKER	You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
COX	Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
PARKER	It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?

COX	These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
PARKER	I've seen worse.
COX	Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.

PARKER	Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
COX	If you can catch him.

COX	She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
PARKER	What she's going to do is get in my way.

COX	This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
PARKER	She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
COX	Fine  you want to stay here?

COX	Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
PARKER	Their weapons missing?
COX	Sid 6.7 is now armed.
PARKER	Where's my gun?

COX	Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
PARKER	You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?

COX	She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
PARKER	Then I guess we're even.

PARKER	When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
COX	On my life, I promise you I will.
PARKER	If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.

COX	... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
MADISON	Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
COX	None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
MADISON	Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
COX	In other words, we collectively don't know shit.

MADISON	I should have told him.
COX	Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
MADISON	I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
COX	You think he's smart?
MADISON	Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.

MADISON	There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
COX	I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
MADISON	I need your help--

COX	Why didn't anybody tell me?!
MADISON	I don't set policy.  You have the key?

COX	Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
MADISON	Got it.

MADISON	Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
DEANE	We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
MADISON	What's the assignment?
DEANE	You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

DEANE	That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
MADISON	Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
DEANE	Not if you're with him every step of the way.
MADISON	The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
DEANE	I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.

DEANE	I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
PARKER	Only because I got pulled out early.
DEANE	Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.

DEANE	Think you can do it?
PARKER	Not from in here.
DEANE	This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.

PARKER	What happens if I can't catch him?
DEANE	If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
PARKER	How do you know I won't run?

DEANE	Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
PARKER	Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
DEANE	What did you find out?
PARKER	Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
DEANE	It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
PARKER	No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
DEANE	Enough to level an entire city block.
PARKER	If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
DEANE	Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
PARKER	Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
DEANE	You know how much man power you're talking about?
PARKER	You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.

DEANE	This better not be a wild goose chase.
PARKER	Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
DEANE	Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.

DEANE	What did Cox pull him out early for?
WALLACE	Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
DEANE	Don't remind me.

DEANE	What the hell happened?
WALLACE	Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
DEANE	Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
WALLACE	I was assured the problem was corrected.

WALLACE	It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
DEANE	Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.

WALLACE	You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
LINDENMEYER	The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
WALLACE	Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
LINDENMEYER	I'm still making adjustments...
WALLACE	You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
LINDENMEYER	I'M WHAT?!
WALLACE	You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
LINDENMEYER	I understand... I understand perfectly.

WALLACE	How does he know who I am?
LINDENMEYER	He hears...everything.
WALLACE	As a matter of fact, I do.

REILLY	HEY!!!
LINDENMEYER	Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
REILLY	I haven't been working on anything.
LINDENMEYER	Do I get to see it or not?
REILLY	Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

LINDENMEYER	Get that fucking thing away from me!
REILLY	You're...such a wimp.

REILLY	Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
LINDENMEYER	It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
REILLY	Coordinated by polymer neural net.
LINDENMEYER	It feels so.. .real.
REILLY	It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
LINDENMEYER	This is supposed to be years away.
REILLY	As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
LINDENMEYER	How do you kill it?
REILLY	Separate the character module from the neural net...

REILLY	... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
LINDENMEYER	Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
REILLY	I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...

LINDENMEYER	You need a maid.
REILLY	What I need is a nymphomaniac.

LINDENMEYER	I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
MADISON	What's wrong with Parker?
LINDENMEYER	How should I know?
MADISON	Show me his physical sensory level.

LINDENMEYER	I wonder how that...
MADISON	Turn it down!

LINDENMEYER	He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
MADISON	Talk so I can understand.
LINDENMEYER	If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
MADISON	Then fix it.

SID 6.7	Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
LINDENMEYER	Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
SID 6.7	Should I have?
LINDENMEYER	Think hard -- it'll come to you...

LINDENMEYER	All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
SID 6.7	True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
LINDENMEYER	It was you, wasn't it?
SID 6.7	It was me, what?
LINDENMEYER	You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
SID 6.7	I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
LINDENMEYER	My God...
SID 6.7	Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
LINDENMEYER	What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
SID 6.7	I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?

SID 6.7	She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
LINDENMEYER	All my work is my finest.

SID 6.7	You catching my drift?
LINDENMEYER	I think I understand what you have in mind...

LINDENMEYER	SID  NO!!!
SID 6.7	What do you expect me to do, thank him?

SID 6.7	I am beautiful, aren't I?
LINDENMEYER	Of course you are.

SID 6.7	How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
LINDENMEYER	Help me get out of here.
SID 6.7	Glad to...

SID 6.7	You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
LINDENMEYER	I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
SID 6.7	Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...

PARKER	You actually listen to all those tapes?
MADISON	No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
PARKER	A little less than yesterday.
MADISON	In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
PARKER	John died.
MADISON	I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
PARKER	You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
MADISON	That's not true, Parker.
PARKER	If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
MADISON	What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
PARKER	Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
MADISON	You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
PARKER	Go to hell.
MADISON	It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
PARKER	Enough!

MADISON	I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
PARKER	I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.

PARKER	I don't need a babysitter.
MADISON	What you need is a collar.

PARKER	Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
MADISON	It wasn't a lie.
PARKER	Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.

MADISON	You all right?
PARKER	Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.

MADISON	You ready for this?
PARKER	Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.

MADISON	He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
PARKER	Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
MADISON	Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
PARKER	Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
MADISON	I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
PARKER	I know who would know.

PARKER	Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
MADISON	He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
PARKER	What happened when he was 17?
MADISON	Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.

MADISON	You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
PARKER	Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.

PARKER	What are you doing?
MADISON	Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
PARKER	You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?

MADISON	This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
PARKER	Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...

PARKER	I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
MADISON	I'm still working on it.

MADISON	Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
PARKER	I've been in prison, remember?
MADISON	The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
PARKER	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...

MADISON	I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
PARKER	... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
MADISON	I am impressed.
PARKER	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
MADISON	Who said that?
PARKER	Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
MADISON	He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.

MADISON	Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
PARKER	Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
MADISON	But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.

PARKER	This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
MADISON	As a matter of fact, it is.

PARKER	Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
MADISON	Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
PARKER	What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
MADISON	In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...

MADISON	Give me your wrist.
PARKER	Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
MADISON	And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.

PARKER	Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
MADISON	How did you get your hand out?

PARKER	Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
MADISON	I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
PARKER	She's beautiful, you know?
MADISON	Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.

PARKER	Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
MADISON	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
PARKER	You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
MADISON	Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
PARKER	What does that mean?
MADISON	Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
PARKER	Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
MADISON	What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
PARKER	Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.

PARKER	I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
MADISON	You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
PARKER	Don't worry about it, all right?
MADISON	Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
PARKER	Relax. I know what you meant.
MADISON	I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
PARKER	Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?

MADISON	Don't get out of the car.
PARKER	Stop me.

MADISON	What the hell's going on?!
PARKER	This is my area of expertise.

MADISON	What did you do to those people?
PARKER	Nothing.

PARKER	Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
MADISON	Enjoying yourself?
PARKER	You know I am.
MADISON	This isn't a game, Parker!
PARKER	Tell him.

PARKER	What's the problem?
MADISON	I'm doing the best I can!

MADISON	Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
PARKER	Start of what?
MADISON	I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...

MADISON	It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
PARKER	You like baseball?

PARKER	Real effective security...
MADISON	You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
PARKER	Authority still makes me nervous.

MADISON	Which way?
PARKER	Both.

MADISON	Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
PARKER	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.

PARKER	Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
MADISON	No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!

MADISON	We know you didn't kill those guards.
PARKER	They're going to fry me for it, anyway.

MADISON	He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
PARKER	You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?

MADISON	How did you find out about the toxin?
PARKER	Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
MADISON	You're not capable of it.
PARKER	I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
MADISON	I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.

MADISON	The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
PARKER	I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
MADISON	Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
PARKER	Part of him is.

MADISON	If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
PARKER	Think he's keeping track of his creation?
MADISON	That, or living through him...

PARKER	See something?
MADISON	I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...

PARKER	Nice work.
MADISON	Thanks.

MADISON	Find out anything?
PARKER	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.

MADISON	Can I ask you something?
PARKER	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
MADISON	You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
PARKER	You don't know?
MADISON	That's why I'm asking.
PARKER	Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.

MADISON	You okay?
PARKER	...I think so...You?
MADISON	More or less.
PARKER	Lindenmeyer?
MADISON	My guess is dead.
PARKER	Sid?
MADISON	I don't know.

PARKER	Where the hell are you going?
MADISON	Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

PARKER	How's your pulse?
MADISON	I couldn't tell you.
PARKER	Then shoot him already.
MADISON	Duck!

MADISON	What do we do now?
PARKER	You won't want to watch. Turn around.

PARKER	Where's John?
SID 6.7	Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?

SID 6.7	The symphony of collision...
PARKER	The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
SID 6.7	I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.

PARKER	You and me have nothing in common.
SID 6.7	Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?

PARKER	You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
SID 6.7	Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
PARKER	GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!

SID 6.7	I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
PARKER	DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
SID 6.7	You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.

SID 6.7	I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
PARKER	Why's that?

PARKER	What C-4...was Cox talking about?
SID 6.7	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
PARKER	Where did you plant the C-4?!

PARKER	What C-4...was Cox talking about?
SID 6.7	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
PARKER	Where did you plant the C-4?!

PARKER	You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
SID 6.7	My...secret.

SID 6.7	It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
PARKER	I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?

SID 6.7	There you go  best seat in the house.
PARKER	You are going after Mayor Bennett.
SID 6.7	Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...

PARKER	Aren't you going to watch with me?
SID 6.7	I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.

SID 6.7	Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
PARKER	What are you talking about?
SID 6.7	I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!

PARKER	Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
SID 6.7	BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!

WALLACE	To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
REILLY	As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
WALLACE	As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
REILLY	Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
WALLACE	Do they have to look so...robotic?
REILLY	At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?

ARTEMUS	J. S. Bach.
JIM	Jim West.
ARTEMUS	Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
JIM	I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
ARTEMUS	Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
JIM	Funny.  So am I.
ARTEMUS	Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
JIM	Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
ARTEMUS	Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...

JIM	Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
ARTEMUS	Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.

JIM	You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
ARTEMUS	If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.

JIM	But don't pull that again.
ARTEMUS	Wouldn't dream of it.

ARTEMUS	Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
JIM	Put them all together and what do we have?
ARTEMUS	A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
JIM	Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
ARTEMUS	Ay, there's the rub.  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.

ARTEMUS	Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
JIM	Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
ARTEMUS	Gadget guy?  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.

ARTEMUS	Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
JIM	You need that real often?
ARTEMUS	Always hoping.  Or this...
JIM	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
ARTEMUS	Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
JIM	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
ARTEMUS	Try what?

JIM	Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
ARTEMUS	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...

JIM	That should put us ahead of the criminals.
ARTEMUS	I'll work on it.

ARTEMUS	Aha!
JIM	Aha?
ARTEMUS	Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
JIM	Is this leading somewhere?
ARTEMUS	Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
JIM	Starting with a screw?
ARTEMUS	Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
JIM	What about the explosive?

ARTEMUS	Limestone quarry?
JIM	Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
ARTEMUS	Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.

ARTEMUS	Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
JIM	Prepare what?
ARTEMUS	My disguise.  And here...

ARTEMUS	Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
JIM	Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
ARTEMUS	Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.

JIM	That's a lot of butler.
ARTEMUS	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
JIM	Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.

JIM	Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
ARTEMUS	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
JIM	All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
ARTEMUS	Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?

ARTEMUS	You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
JIM	Almost?
ARTEMUS	Yes.  Now, observe....

JIM	You feeling all right?
ARTEMUS	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.

ARTEMUS	Now, what was that?
JIM	You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
ARTEMUS	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.

ARTEMUS	What was all that back there?
JIM	All what?
ARTEMUS	All that jumping and kicking.
JIM	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.

ARTEMUS	Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
JIM	And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.

ARTEMUS	Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
JIM	I'm going to hit you.

JIM	Never seen a gun fire so fast!
ARTEMUS	It's a repeating steam cannon!

JIM	At least I tried something.
ARTEMUS	Hey, I tried the board.

ARTEMUS	Damn it, this is ridiculous.
JIM	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
ARTEMUS	That's right... That's good.

ARTEMUS	Jim, are you all right?
JIM	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
ARTEMUS	Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.

ARTEMUS	If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
JIM	What way is that?
ARTEMUS	So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
JIM	Spontaneous.  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
ARTEMUS	Well... that, too.
JIM	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.

ARTEMUS	So... what happened?
JIM	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
ARTEMUS	Uh... how long ago was this?
JIM	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.

JIM	You might have mentioned you had that.
ARTEMUS	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.

ARTEMUS	Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
JIM	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...

ARTEMUS	They're so precious when they're asleep.
JIM	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?

ARTEMUS	Can you fill me in here?
JIM	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
ARTEMUS	Thank you.
JIM	Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
ARTEMUS	You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.

ARTEMUS	Know what this is?
JIM	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
ARTEMUS	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.

JIM	This is good.
ARTEMUS	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!

ARTEMUS	Oh, damn!  That's it.
JIM	It's better than nothing.
ARTEMUS	It is?
JIM	He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.

JIM	No record of him.
ARTEMUS	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.

ARTEMUS	What's this?
JIM	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
ARTEMUS	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.

ARTEMUS	Willard...
JIM	It's not a guy...
ARTEMUS	It's a town!

ARTEMUS	Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
JIM	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?

JIM	Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
ARTEMUS	Relax.  We're almost there.
JIM	We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!

JIM	What is that?
ARTEMUS	This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
JIM	And people are actually fooled by that?
ARTEMUS	My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.

JIM	Not again.
ARTEMUS	I adjusted it.

JIM	So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
ARTEMUS	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

JIM	When we find him, he is mine.
ARTEMUS	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

ARTEMUS	What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
JIM	Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...

ARTEMUS	Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
JIM	Oh, thank you.
ARTEMUS	My pleasure.

JIM	Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
ARTEMUS	What?  President Grant is...!
JIM	I know!  I know!
ARTEMUS	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
JIM	We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
ARTEMUS	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
JIM	There's only seventy-eight.
ARTEMUS	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!

ARTEMUS	It was in your book.
JIM	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.

JIM	Are those just button buttons or...?
ARTEMUS	Of course not.

ARTEMUS	My hat is off to you, sir.
JIM	Thank you.

ARTEMUS	God in heaven, what is that?!
JIM	That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!

ARTEMUS	My God!  He's so excessive!
JIM	Where have you been?

JIM	Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
ARTEMUS	Oh, I see, an easy plan!

ARTEMUS	The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
JIM	He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
ARTEMUS	All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
JIM	In the next two minutes?

JIM	Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
ARTEMUS	What is this?  A whole new train?
JIM	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?

JIM	Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
ARTEMUS	I'm sure we will.

ARTEMUS	Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
PEMBERTON	Yes, me!
ARTEMUS	You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.

ARTEMUS	You didn't tell us you had this on!
PEMBERTON	My Lord, he was telling the truth!

PEMBERTON	He calls it the Tarantula.
ARTEMUS	But it only has six legs.

PEMBERTON	He's not giving up?
ARTEMUS	Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...

ARTEMUS	Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
PEMBERTON	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!

MIGUELITO	A new friend?
CASSANDRA	We'll see.

MIGUELITO	Anyone?
CASSANDRA	Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
MIGUELITO	Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...

MIGUELITO	I could get used to this, looking down on people.
CASSANDRA	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
MIGUELITO	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.

JIM	My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
CASSANDRA	I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
JIM	You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
CASSANDRA	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.

JIM	Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
CASSANDRA	Really?
JIM	Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
CASSANDRA	My... the wild west.

CASSANDRA	Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
JIM	Your guests, ma'am?
CASSANDRA	Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.

CASSANDRA	Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
JIM	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
CASSANDRA	You most certainly do.

CASSANDRA	You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
JIM	I don't like to lose, either.

CASSANDRA	Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
JIM	You tell me.
CASSANDRA	I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
JIM	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
CASSANDRA	Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
JIM	I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.

JIM	Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
CASSANDRA	Would that include me?
JIM	Oh, I would hope not.

CASSANDRA	You've... done... this... before.
JIM	I've had some practice.

CASSANDRA	She's perfectly safe.
JIM	Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?

CASSANDRA	My.  It's gotten longer.
JIM	You bring the best out in a man.
CASSANDRA	I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.

JIM	You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
CASSANDRA	Fine, I'll stop.

JIM	Look, I'm Captain James West...
DOYLE	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.

DOYLE	Your private train, sir.
JIM	Private train?
DOYLE	That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.

DOYLE	Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
JIM	My friend?

DOYLE	Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
JIM	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?

GRANT	Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
RICHARDS	Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...

GRANT	Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
RICHARDS	Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
GRANT	French?
RICHARDS	Yes sir.
GRANT	French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!

RICHARDS	Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
GRANT	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?

JIM	Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
GRANT	That'll be all, boys.

JIM	Good work.  Really.
GRANT	This is Colonel Richards.
JIM	Nice to finally meet you, sir.

JIM	But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
GRANT	Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.

GRANT	We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
JIM	Nicely said, sir.
GRANT	Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.

GRANT	Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
JIM	And?
GRANT	And now the job's yours.

JIM	... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
GRANT	On my way to Denver...

JIM	Where'd he say he was going to do this?
GRANT	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

JIM	I admire a man with a sense of humor.
MIGUELITO	When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?

JIM	I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
MIGUELITO	Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.

MIGUELITO	Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
JIM	No, sir... just a businessman.
MIGUELITO	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
JIM	I deal with some tough customers.

MIGUELITO	Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
JIM	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?

JIM	Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
MIGUELITO	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?

MIGUELITO	... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
JIM	Dr. Loveless?

JIM	You're not that big.
MIGUELITO	Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.

MIGUELITO	Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
JIM	He had a pressing engagement.
MIGUELITO	Philistine.

JIM	You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
MIGUELITO	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
JIM	Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?

JIM	The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
MIGUELITO	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!

MIGUELITO	These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
JIM	That would be... the Mexican War?
MIGUELITO	Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!

MIGUELITO	I've even printed my own currency.
JIM	Emperor Miguelito...?
MIGUELITO	The first.
JIM	Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
MIGUELITO	Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
JIM	So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?

JIM	Easy now.
MIGUELITO	Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?

JIM	Dr. Pemberton?
PEMBERTON	Yes!

JIM	Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
PEMBERTON	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
JIM	We'll explain on the way.

PEMBERTON	I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
JIM	Who was this partner of his?
PEMBERTON	A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
JIM	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.

JIM	Are you all right?
PEMBERTON	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.

PEMBERTON	He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
JIM	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.

JIM	This is something.
PEMBERTON	It's a smelting retort.

JIM	Now it's a bomb.
PEMBERTON	It is?

JIM	I beg your pardon?
PEMBERTON	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

JIM	Well?
WALTERS	They're coming.
JIM	When are they coming?
WALTERS	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
JIM	In an hour they're gone!

WALTERS	Hey...!
JIM	You're not going to use it, are you?
WALTERS	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
JIM	Right.

XANDER	Who the hell are you?
GIBBONS	The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
XANDER	What is this place?
GIBBONS	Looks like a diner.
XANDER	Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?

GIBBONS	Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
XANDER	That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
GIBBONS	Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
XANDER	Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
GIBBONS	It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
XANDER	A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
GIBBONS	Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
XANDER	..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
GIBBONS	Why is that?
XANDER	Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
GIBBONS	Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
XANDER	Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
GIBBONS	You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
XANDER	Is that a fact?
GIBBONS	Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
XANDER	You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
GIBBONS	You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.

GIBBONS	Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
XANDER	You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
GIBBONS	Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.

GIBBONS	You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
XANDER	You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
GIBBONS	You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
XANDER	I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
GIBBONS	You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
XANDER	I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
GIBBONS	That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.

XANDER	Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
GIBBONS	There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
XANDER	What do I get out of it?
GIBBONS	If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
XANDER	You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.

XANDER	Not bad for a gimp.
GIBBONS	What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.

XANDER	How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
GIBBONS	Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
XANDER	Yeah, I spy or I die.

GIBBONS	I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
XANDER	Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.

XANDER	Up yours.
GIBBONS	Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.

XANDER	Is that all?
GIBBONS	Just remember, I'll be watching.

XANDER	I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
GIBBONS	If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
XANDER	Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
GIBBONS	One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
XANDER	I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
GIBBONS	We're not after car thieves here.
XANDER	What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
GIBBONS	That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
XANDER	Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
GIBBONS	My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
XANDER	I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.

GIBBONS	You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
XANDER	Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
GIBBONS	This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
XANDER	Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
GIBBONS	I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.

XANDER	Thanks.
GIBBONS	You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
XANDER	You ain't seen nothing yet.

XANDER	Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
GIBBONS	I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
XANDER	They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
GIBBONS	Yes it does.
XANDER	Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
GIBBONS	Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
XANDER	Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
GIBBONS	Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
XANDER	Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
GIBBONS	Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
XANDER	We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.

GIBBONS	Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
XANDER	I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
GIBBONS	You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
XANDER	But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
GIBBONS	Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
XANDER	Who says you're the good guys?

GIBBONS	You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
XANDER	Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
GIBBONS	On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
XANDER	No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
GIBBONS	All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
XANDER	You're a jerk-off, you know that?

SAM TANNICK	What do you have?
GIBBONS	Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
SAM TANNICK	He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
GIBBONS	They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
SAM TANNICK	Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
GIBBONS	We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
SAM TANNICK	How will you fix it?
GIBBONS	I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
SAM TANNICK	So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
GIBBONS	You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.

GIBBONS	The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
SAM TANNICK	The scum of the Earth.
GIBBONS	But programmable. And expendable.
SAM TANNICK	I've seen enough. Turn it off.

SAM TANNICK	They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
GIBBONS	That's exactly why we need them.

SAM TANNICK	Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
GIBBONS	I think we should send him whatever he wants.
SAM TANNICK	You what? A wire transfer of this size?
GIBBONS	If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
SAM TANNICK	You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
GIBBONS	He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
SAM TANNICK	Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?

SAM TANNICK	Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
GIBBONS	So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.

JEFE	Whatchu doing here?
XANDER	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
JEFE	That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.

JEFE	We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
XANDER	We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

XANDER	We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
JEFE	You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
XANDER	Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
JEFE	Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?

KID	What game is that?
XANDER	Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
KID	Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
XANDER	You wanna check it out? Come here.

XANDER	Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
KID	Naturally.

KID	This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
XANDER	Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.

XANDER	Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
KID	Anarchy 99"?
XANDER	What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
KID	What weapons do you have?

XANDER	Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
KID	What do you get if you finish?
XANDER	Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
KID	Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
XANDER	Like what?
KID	He gets to be the hero.

PETRA	Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
XANDER	I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.

PETRA	Do you know what a wire transfer is?
XANDER	Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
PETRA	My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
XANDER	Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
PETRA	So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.

XANDER	If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
PETRA	Yorgi asked me to.
XANDER	You do everything Yorgi says?
PETRA	Go to hell.
XANDER	It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
PETRA	Mind your business.
XANDER	Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.

XANDER	Where are you going?
PETRA	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
XANDER	I was invited. What's your story?
PETRA	I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.

XANDER	Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
PETRA	Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
XANDER	That right? Why's that?

PETRA	Who are you?
XANDER	We hung out last night, remember?
PETRA	I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
XANDER	Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.

PETRA	Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
XANDER	You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.

XANDER	Hey, you're good.
PETRA	Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
XANDER	That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?

PETRA	I don't know what you're talking about.
XANDER	The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
PETRA	Go to hell!
XANDER	Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.

PETRA	What are you?
XANDER	I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?

PETRA	That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
XANDER	I'm from L.A.
PETRA	So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
XANDER	Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
PETRA	Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
XANDER	Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
PETRA	You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
XANDER	I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
PETRA	Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
XANDER	The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
PETRA	All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
XANDER	We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
PETRA	A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
XANDER	So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?

PETRA	They tell me you're an American agent.
XANDER	What are you talking about?
PETRA	There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
XANDER	It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
PETRA	Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
XANDER	If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
PETRA	That's alright, I'll figure something out.
XANDER	Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.

PETRA	I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
XANDER	They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.

XANDER	So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
PETRA	No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
XANDER	We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
PETRA	There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
XANDER	What's that?
PETRA	I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
XANDER	You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
PETRA	I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
XANDER	I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.

PETRA	No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
XANDER	Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
PETRA	Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
XANDER	When can I see you again?
PETRA	You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?

PETRA	Are you alright?
XANDER	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
PETRA	I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
XANDER	I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.

XANDER	What are you doing with the Ivans?
PETRA	I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.

XANDER	Where are we going?
PETRA	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
XANDER	Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
PETRA	It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
XANDER	Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
PETRA	What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
XANDER	Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
PETRA	No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
XANDER	We can't leave now. We have to do something.
PETRA	Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.

PETRA	They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
XANDER	We'll have to go after them.
PETRA	Aren't you afraid?
XANDER	A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
PETRA	I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
XANDER	You don't have to do that.
PETRA	Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
XANDER	Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
PETRA	I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
XANDER	When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
PETRA	What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.

PETRA	Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
XANDER	He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.

PETRA	Yorgi and Kirill.
XANDER	Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.

XANDER	Did you do your homework?
PETRA	If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
XANDER	Let's do this.

XANDER	Where's he headed?
PETRA	He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.

XANDER	Where'd the damn truck go?!
PETRA	Go to the water, it's that way!

XANDER	Toadies right behind.
PETRA	Let me.

XANDER	You okay?
PETRA	A piece of shrapnel hit me.
XANDER	I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.

PETRA	He's shut out the communication circuit!
XANDER	You can't talk to it?
PETRA	No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
XANDER	A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.

PETRA	It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
XANDER	It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
PETRA	By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
XANDER	Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!

PETRA	I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
XANDER	You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.

PETRA	What are you doing?
XANDER	It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.

PETRA	Nothing. He had two days.
YORGI	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.

PETRA	What are you doing?
YORGI	It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.

YORGI	What was that for?
PETRA	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
YORGI	You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
PETRA	Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
YORGI	Viktor! Stay the course.

PETRA	The Peace conference...
YORGI	Nice place to start, don't you think?

SHAVERS	Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
XANDER	That's would be me.

SHAVERS	Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
XANDER	I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
SHAVERS	Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
XANDER	Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
SHAVERS	Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.

SHAVERS	Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
XANDER	They come in any other styles or colors?

SHAVERS	This is your standard dart gun.
XANDER	That one I'm real familiar with.

XANDER	I think I'll hang on to these.
SHAVERS	Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.

XANDER	From the Beastie Boys collection?
SHAVERS	It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
XANDER	You're joking, right?

SHAVERS	Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
XANDER	I thought that was in detail.

XANDER	Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
SKY	I'm through, Xander.
XANDER	I can see that. Why?
SKY	You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
XANDER	I'm having fun, what's the problem?
SKY	You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
XANDER	I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...

SKY	French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
XANDER	Alright, so I'll get more.
SKY	It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
XANDER	Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.

SKY	What...?
XANDER	I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
SKY	You're serious?
XANDER	Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
SKY	This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
XANDER	I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
SKY	You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
XANDER	You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
SKY	You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.

SLOVO	Sit down.
XANDER	I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.

SLOVO	My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
XANDER	Here we go again.
SLOVO	You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
XANDER	First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.

XANDER	Nice hops.
SLOVO	The corner. Anarchy 99.

SLOVO	I'll leave you two alone to talk.
XANDER	Yeah, thanks a lot.

XANDER	Dude, what are you doing here?
SLOVO	You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?

XANDER	I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
SLOVO	Is this what you're looking for?

SLOVO	Sorry, "dude".
XANDER	What's the deal?
SLOVO	Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
XANDER	Why you dogging me up?
SLOVO	They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.

VIRG	What's so damn funny?
XANDER	Been to any good diners lately?

VIRG	Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
XANDER	A parachute. This does not argue well.

XANDER	Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
VIRG	He's a pretty good actor, though.

XANDER	Help me with this guy.
VIRG	It's like you said, every man for himself.

VIRG	They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
XANDER	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.

XANDER	That's the guy.
YORGI	This pizda? Never seen him before.
XANDER	Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?

YORGI	Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
XANDER	He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
YORGI	I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.

XANDER	Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
YORGI	Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
XANDER	I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?

YORGI	I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
XANDER	When else are you gonna do it?

YORGI	We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
XANDER	Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.

YORGI	Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
XANDER	It'll work faster if I have an account number.

XANDER	Very nice. I'm impressed.
YORGI	I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...

XANDER	I had to inspect the merchandise first.
YORGI	Of course.

XANDER	What's this?
YORGI	This is a gift. From me to you.

YORGI	What's going on, my friend?
XANDER	You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
YORGI	He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
XANDER	Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.

YORGI	I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
XANDER	Had to do what I had to do.

YORGI	Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
XANDER	What's "Anarchy 99"?
YORGI	It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
XANDER	You wanna see my politics?

XANDER	Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
YORGI	That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

YORGI	To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
XANDER	...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese. 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
YORGI	You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
XANDER	How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
YORGI	Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.

XANDER	You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
YORGI	It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
XANDER	I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
YORGI	You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
XANDER	Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
YORGI	Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
XANDER	My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.

YORGI	I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
XANDER	That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
YORGI	You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.

YORGI	That was for Anders.
XANDER	Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.

YORGI	And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
XANDER	I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
YORGI	Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.

XANDER	What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
YORGI	You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
XANDER	So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
YORGI	Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
XANDER	Including rape, pillage, murder.
YORGI	Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
XANDER	And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
YORGI	Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.

YORGI	You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
XANDER	Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
