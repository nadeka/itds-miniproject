EMIL	Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
CUTLER	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
EMIL	Here.  I have your money.

EMIL	Oh no!  No!  Shit!
CUTLER	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
EMIL	He has the camera!  He took the movie!

CUTLER	Don't say anything.
EMIL	Where are we going?
CUTLER	I'm coming with you.
EMIL	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
CUTLER	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.

CUTLER	I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
EMIL	You bring the cigarettes?
CUTLER	Oh, sure.

CUTLER	...delusions and paranoia.
EMIL	I was all of these.
CUTLER	Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
EMIL	What about Oleg?
CUTLER	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
EMIL	No, he is here.  Shit...
CUTLER	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
EMIL	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
CUTLER	Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
EMIL	What's your cut?  How much?
CUTLER	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
EMIL	No.  No way.
CUTLER	But it's...
EMIL	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
CUTLER	This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
EMIL	What else do you need?
CUTLER	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
EMIL	Give me another one, please.

CUTLER	Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
EMIL	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
CUTLER	Your mother was blind?
EMIL	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
CUTLER	Back in the Czech Republic?
EMIL	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
CUTLER	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
EMIL	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?

EMIL	That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
CUTLER	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
EMIL	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
CUTLER	Can I see your back?

EMIL	I'm abused.  Don't you think?
CUTLER	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.

EMIL	...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
CUTLER	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!

DAPHNE	...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
JORDY	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
DAPHNE	Yes, but he was a cop.

DAPHNE	Now I become custody of police department?
JORDY	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
DAPHNE	I will if they don't send me back.
JORDY	They won't until this is over.

DAPHNE	Are you married?
JORDY	Divorced.
DAPHNE	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?

JORDY	I can't take you to my place.
DAPHNE	Somewhere else?

JORDY	The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
DAPHNE	So...the station is empty?
JORDY	Yeah.  This way.

JORDY	You considered becoming a prostitute?
DAPHNE	Yes, I considered it.
JORDY	Did you ever turn tricks before?
DAPHNE	No.
JORDY	What about back home?
DAPHNE	No.

DAPHNE	I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
JORDY	So you were never a prostitute?
DAPHNE	What are you asking me?
JORDY	I'm just trying to find out who you are.

DAPHNE	I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
JORDY	I know.
DAPHNE	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
JORDY	They're not gonna send you right back.
DAPHNE	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

DAPHNE	Are you alright?
JORDY	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
DAPHNE	I'm sorry.

JORDY	Is he your boyfriend?
DAPHNE	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
JORDY	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
DAPHNE	If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

JORDY	A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
DAPHNE	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
JORDY	I'm glad I met you.

JORDY	You better get packed.
DAPHNE	Right.

JORDY	Do you have coffee?
DAPHNE	In the kitchen.
JORDY	I'll make some for us.
DAPHNE	I'll get my clothes.

JORDY	What are you doing?
DAPHNE	Pouring it out!

DAPHNE	Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
JORDY	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
DAPHNE	I don't want to drag you down with me.
JORDY	Daphne, I...

DAPHNE	I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
EDDIE	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
DAPHNE	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
EDDIE	Go on.

EDDIE	Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
DAPHNE	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
EDDIE	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?

EDDIE	Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
DAPHNE	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

EDDIE	A cop?
DAPHNE	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
EDDIE	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
DAPHNE	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

DUFFY	Oh.
EDDIE	It was my decision, not his.
DUFFY	Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
EDDIE	Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
DUFFY	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
EDDIE	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
DUFFY	Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.

DUFFY	Who did cause and origin?
JORDY	Who do you think, Chief?!
DUFFY	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
JORDY	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.

JORDY	Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
DUFFY	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!

JORDY	Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
DUFFY	What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
JORDY	I let her take a shower.
DUFFY	A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
JORDY	No!  Nothing happened.
DUFFY	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!

JORDY	Chief - mind if I take her?
DUFFY	Okay.  But not water sports.

DUFFY	The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
JORDY	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
DUFFY	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
JORDY	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
DUFFY	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
JORDY	End my career?
DUFFY	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
JORDY	But Chief?  Over this??
DUFFY	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.

DUFFY	Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
KORFIN	Yeah, right.
DUFFY	What was that, Korfin?
KORFIN	I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
DUFFY	You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

DUFFY	Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
KORFIN	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
DUFFY	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
KORFIN	Yeah.

LEON	Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
EDDIE	Vodka tonic.
LEON	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?

LEON	It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
EDDIE	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.

EDDIE	I'm gonna propose.
LEON	When?
EDDIE	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
LEON	You ready?

LEON	What's he looking for?
EDDIE	A timer.

EDDIE	Where is she?
LEON	Takin' a bath.
EDDIE	Any I.D.?
LEON	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

LEON	Sorry...PD only.
EDDIE	It's okay.

EDDIE	Only one guys checked in?
LEON	Yeah.
EDDIE	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.

EDDIE	The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
LEON	Stay with her.

EDDIE	Are you hit?
LEON	No.  I'm okay.

LEON	He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
EDDIE	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.

ROSE	Who's there?
EDDIE	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
ROSE	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
EDDIE	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

ROSE	What's wrong?
EDDIE	We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
ROSE	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

ROSE	Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
EDDIE	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
ROSE	No.
EDDIE	Did you tell him you did?

ROSE	Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
EDDIE	What are you saying?
ROSE	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.

ROSE	He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
EDDIE	Describe him.
ROSE	Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
EDDIE	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
ROSE	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.

JORDY	Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
EDDIE	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

JORDY	You know what that is, right?
EDDIE	No, what is it?
JORDY	Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?

JORDY	It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
EDDIE	Watch the news?
JORDY	Nah, I musta missed it.
EDDIE	Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
JORDY	Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
EDDIE	Nah, why should you?
JORDY	I don't even watch TV.
EDDIE	Good.  Good.  Commendable.

JORDY	Did you get a report from the M.E.?
EDDIE	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
JORDY	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
EDDIE	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.

JORDY	The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
EDDIE	Pretty.
JORDY	Hmmmm.
EDDIE	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
JORDY	Who says she's a suspect?

EDDIE	What would you call her?
JORDY	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

JORDY	Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
EDDIE	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
JORDY	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.

JORDY	I'll come with you.
EDDIE	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
JORDY	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
EDDIE	This isn't homicide school.
JORDY	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
EDDIE	You're Polish?
JORDY	My folks are.
EDDIE	Stay here.

JORDY	You goin' to the escort service?
EDDIE	You got any better ideas?
JORDY	Mind if I ride along with you?
EDDIE	This has nothing to do with your fire.
JORDY	But what if it does?  You might need my help.

EDDIE	I'll let you know what happens.
JORDY	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
EDDIE	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
JORDY	I'll call it... tails.

JORDY	Two heads.
EDDIE	Better than one.

EDDIE	Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
JORDY	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.

EDDIE	You thirsty?
JORDY	I'm on duty.
EDDIE	So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
JORDY	Of course.
EDDIE	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
JORDY	I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
EDDIE	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.

EDDIE	What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
JORDY	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
EDDIE	Is that all there is?

JORDY	Why not?
EDDIE	Something back home?

EDDIE	She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
JORDY	Raw deal.

JORDY	Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
EDDIE	You wanna talk to her alone?
JORDY	Yeah.
EDDIE	What would your girlfriend think of that?
JORDY	I don't have a girlfriend.
EDDIE	My point exactly.
JORDY	I'm serious here.
EDDIE	So am I.
JORDY	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
EDDIE	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
JORDY	You know what I'm saying here.

EDDIE	Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
JORDY	Hey.  I'm a professional.
EDDIE	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.

JORDY	Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
EDDIE	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
JORDY	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
EDDIE	Just a shower?

JORDY	Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
EDDIE	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
JORDY	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
EDDIE	Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
JORDY	But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
EDDIE	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.

JORDY	Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
EDDIE	You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.

EMIL	So...who's Nicky?
EDDIE	What do you want?
EMIL	Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
EDDIE	What's your accomplishment.
EMIL	I kill someone famous.
EDDIE	Then do it, asshole.
EMIL	Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.

EMIL	So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
EDDIE	If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.

EDDIE	You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
EMIL	Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?

NICOLETTE	Detective, does it look like a murder?
EDDIE	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
NICOLETTE	How many victims are up there?
EDDIE	There are two bodies found at this point.
NICOLETTE	Can we go up to the crime scene?
EDDIE	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
NICOLETTE	Is it drug related?
EDDIE	We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

NICOLETTE	Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
EDDIE	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.

NICOLETTE	I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
EDDIE	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
NICOLETTE	Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
EDDIE	He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
NICOLETTE	Do you have the suspect in custody?
EDDIE	Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
NICOLETTE	Alright, cut, cut, cut.

NICOLETTE	Eddie, are you okay?
EDDIE	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
NICOLETTE	Alright.
EDDIE	Alright?
NICOLETTE	Alright.
EDDIE	Alright.
NICOLETTE	Okay.

NICOLETTE	Hey, honey.
EDDIE	Hey.

NICOLETTE	What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
EDDIE	I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
NICOLETTE	You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
EDDIE	Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
NICOLETTE	Stop it.
EDDIE	Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
NICOLETTE	Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
EDDIE	I'm not.
NICOLETTE	Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
EDDIE	Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
NICOLETTE	That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
EDDIE	You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
NICOLETTE	Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
EDDIE	You're ruthless.
NICOLETTE	You're not so bad yourself.

NICOLETTE	Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
EDDIE	Could be Leon's.
NICOLETTE	Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?

NICOLETTE	Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
EDDIE	Answer the phone.
NICOLETTE	No.  Tell me what you want to say.
EDDIE	Answer it.
NICOLETTE	Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?

NICOLETTE	Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
EDDIE	That's good.
NICOLETTE	Yeah.
EDDIE	Well, that's great.
NICOLETTE	Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
EDDIE	No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
NICOLETTE	No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
EDDIE	I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
NICOLETTE	Promise?
EDDIE	I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
NICOLETTE	Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
EDDIE	Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
NICOLETTE	I love you.

NICOLETTE	Okay, til tonight.
EDDIE	Tonight.
NICOLETTE	You promise?
EDDIE	Yeah.  I promise.
NICOLETTE	Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
EDDIE	Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
NICOLETTE	Okay.
EDDIE	See you later.  Good luck.
NICOLETTE	Thank you.
EDDIE	Don't be late.

EDDIE	So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
HAWKINS	Jesus Christ.

HAWKINS	Sooner or later that's everybody.
EDDIE	Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
HAWKINS	I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
EDDIE	I'm not moody.

EDDIE	How old are your kids?
HAWKINS	My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?

HAWKINS	So what's unique?
EDDIE	Not what.  Who.

EDDIE	He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
HAWKINS	That's unique.
EDDIE	Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

EDDIE	I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
HAWKINS	You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.

HAWKINS	Ready?
EDDIE	Keep them out of my way.
HAWKINS	Okay.  You ready?
EDDIE	Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

HAWKINS	Any chance we can do that again?
EDDIE	Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.

SECONDARY OFFICER	Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
EMIL	I am butcher.
SECONDARY OFFICER	You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
EMIL	You stuff sausage in it.
SECONDARY OFFICER	And what do you do with the bones?
EMIL	Dog food.

SECONDARY OFFICER	Are you married?
EMIL	No.  Are you proposing?

EMIL	Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
HAWKINS	Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
EMIL	No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
HAWKINS	I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
EMIL	We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
HAWKINS	What?  It doesn't work that way.
EMIL	If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
HAWKINS	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
EMIL	Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.

JORDY	Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
EMIL	My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
JORDY	Tommy, take a walk.

EMIL	You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
JORDY	You'll be my first.

EMIL	C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
JORDY	Get down on your knees.

JORDY	Where's your partner?
EMIL	The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

EMIL	Tell him to put his gun down!
JORDY	Let her go!  Let her go!!
EMIL	If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.

HONEY	Hi, I'm Honey.
EMIL	Where's Czech girl?
HONEY	Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

HONEY	Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
EMIL	I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?

HONEY	It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
EMIL	Where is escort service?
HONEY	That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
EMIL	I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
HONEY	Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?

EMIL	Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
HONEY	Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.

EMIL	Give me the address!!
HONEY	Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
EMIL	Yes sir.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER	What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
EMIL	Two weeks holiday.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	How much money are you carrying with you?
EMIL	I have five-hundred dollars.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!

IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
EMIL	Yes.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Please join us.  Come on forward.
EMIL	Is there a problem?
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?

EMIL	We are both from Prague.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	How long are you planning to stay?
EMIL	Two weeks.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
EMIL	He doesn't speak English.

EMIL	Who is he?
VENDOR	New York's finest.  This is his case.

VENDOR	This all you want?
EMIL	Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
VENDOR	In here, says he wants a million.
EMIL	Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
VENDOR	Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
EMIL	Yes.  Both.

EMIL	Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
OLEG	Okay.

EMIL	Don't fool around.
OLEG	Okay.

EMIL	Did you hear what I said?
OLEG	I want to document my trip to America.

OLEG	Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
EMIL	Don't speak Russian!
OLEG	Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
EMIL	Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!

OLEG	Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
EMIL	We have no money.  Come on.

EMIL	Turn that off!  Get the bags.
OLEG	Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
EMIL	For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.

OLEG	What?
EMIL	Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.

EMIL	Turn that fucking thing off!
OLEG	I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.

EMIL	Speak English!
OLEG	You said speak Czech!
EMIL	How you erase this?
OLEG	I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

OLEG	Whore?
EMIL	I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?

EMIL	Get in the bathroom!
OLEG	Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
EMIL	Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!

OLEG	Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
EMIL	Shut up.
OLEG	Does it hurt?

OLEG	Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
EMIL	Don't want to film this?

OLEG	What is it?
EMIL	The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
OLEG	I did.
EMIL	And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
OLEG	Why not?
EMIL	Put the camera down, Oleg.

OLEG	What is that?
EMIL	What does it look like?  It's an address book!

OLEG	Let me get a shot of it.
EMIL	Sit down!
OLEG	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

EMIL	No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
OLEG	Good idea!

EMIL	Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
OLEG	Cut!

OLEG	You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
EMIL	Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!

OLEG	In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
EMIL	The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.

OLEG	I'm serious.
EMIL	Shut up.  Look!

OLEG	This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
EMIL	Bad last moment - I cut it out.

EMIL	I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
OLEG	Be quiet.  Watch.

EMIL	Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
OLEG	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
EMIL	Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

OLEG	I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
EMIL	Credit?
OLEG	Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
EMIL	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

EMIL	You got that?
OLEG	No, I don't get that!
EMIL	You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.

EMIL	Traitor!!
OLEG	No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!

MILOS	Emil???!
EMIL	Surprise!  Surprise!

EMIL	Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
MILOS	Did you hurt her?
EMIL	You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?

MILOS	Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
EMIL	Milos.  Get my money!

MILOS	We spent it!
EMIL	Ha. Ha.
MILOS	Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!

MILOS	I can get you a job.
EMIL	A job?
MILOS	Yes, the money is good.
EMIL	As a plumber?!
MILOS	It's easy to learn.
EMIL	A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
MILOS	We started over, you can too.
EMIL	You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?

MAGGIE	Robert...?
HAWKINS	What are you doing here?
MAGGIE	You've got a call.
HAWKINS	I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
MAGGIE	Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

HAWKINS	Viewer discretion advised!
MAGGIE	You want the tape?  There it is!

HAWKINS	Isn't he a little moody?
LEON	Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
HAWKINS	In love?  With who?

LEON	Yeah?
HAWKINS	Paulie, you've got kids, right?

LEON	And you, you'll pay for what you did!
HAWKINS	This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

LEON	You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
HAWKINS	If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
LEON	Don't give me that fucking shit.

HAWKINS	I know.
NICOLETTE	What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
HAWKINS	Well, he...
NICOLETTE	I want to hear everything he said.
HAWKINS	I'm trying to tell you.
NICOLETTE	Alright.  Go ahead.
HAWKINS	That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
NICOLETTE	Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!

OLEG	Yes...he's my friend.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?

OLEG	I speak English.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
OLEG	New York.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
OLEG	A cheap hotel.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	What are you coming here to do?
OLEG	I'm here for movies.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
OLEG	Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Excuse me?

LEON	No.  Go ahead.
JORDY	Thanks.  Appreciate it.

JORDY	So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
LEON	That's what it looks like to me.
JORDY	And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
LEON	Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.

LEON	What was that?
JORDY	Evidence.  Of a homicide.

LEON	I'll take him.
JORDY	No way!  He's mine!
LEON	We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
JORDY	He's my collar!
LEON	Well, he killed my partner!
JORDY	He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.

MUGGER	Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
JORDY	Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
MUGGER	Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?

JORDY	Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
MUGGER	Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
JORDY	Oh yeah?  Guess again.

JORDY	I'll send a cop back for you.
MUGGER	Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!

JORDY	You okay?
MUGGER	A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
JORDY	Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.

JORDY	What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
MAX	Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
JORDY	How did you start the fire this time?
MAX	I used an accelerant.
JORDY	Yeah?  What kind?
MAX	Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.

KORFIN	Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
JORDY	I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
KORFIN	I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
JORDY	You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
KORFIN	Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
JORDY	Oh yeah, why?
KORFIN	'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!

KORFIN	Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
JORDY	Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.

JORDY	Mouth's clean, too.
KORFIN	Clean?
JORDY	Don't blow your nose!

JORDY	The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
KORFIN	But you knew that, right?

KORFIN	You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
JORDY	He knew all along.
KORFIN	What??
JORDY	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.

KORFIN	What?
JORDY	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!

JORDY	Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
KORFIN	Yeah?
JORDY	Maybe you can be his stand-in.

KORFIN	-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
JORDY	How long they been livin' here?
KORFIN	You hear that question, Garcia?

JORDY	You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
KORFIN	Aren't you tired?
JORDY	If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.

JORDY	Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
KORFIN	It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
JORDY	Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

KORFIN	How was it?
JORDY	Not good.

JORDY	Get outta here!
KORFIN	What the hell happened?
JORDY	They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!

TOMMY	Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
JORDY	Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
TOMMY	The clerk?

TOMMY	What are you gonna do?
JORDY	Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
TOMMY	Don't stoop to his level!

JORDY	Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
TOMMY	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
JORDY	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!

STEPHEN GELLER	This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS	Your doctor?
STEPHEN GELLER	Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
ROBERT HAWKINS	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
STEPHEN GELLER	It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS	You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
STEPHEN GELLER	Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
ROBERT HAWKINS	Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
STEPHEN GELLER	Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
ROBERT HAWKINS	And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
STEPHEN GELLER	We're in negotiations, that's correct.
ROBERT HAWKINS	But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
STEPHEN GELLER	That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.

ATTENDANT	Yeah?
LUTHER	I want to pick up my car.

ATTENDANT	Name?
LUTHER	Hammond.

ATTENDANT	This is three years old.
LUTHER	Yeah, I've been busy.

ATTENDANT	We don't wash 'em, ya know.
LUTHER	How about chargin' the battery?
ATTENDANT	That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
LUTHER	Great, just great.

BARTENDER	Yeah.
HAMMOND	Vodka.
BARTENDER	Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
HAMMOND	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

HAMMOND	Now how's your memory doin'?
BARTENDER	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
HAMMOND	Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
BARTENDER	I don't give a shit who you ask.

HAMMOND	I don't give a damn about his girl...
BARTENDER	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.

BARTENDER	I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
HAMMOND	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...

GANZ	Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
BILLY	You got a real big mouth, convict.

GANZ	I want to drive awhile.
BILLY	I ain't tired yet.
GANZ	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
BILLY	Whaddya mean, buy?
GANZ	Pros.

BILLY	Pay money?
GANZ	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
BILLY	I never paid for it in my life.
GANZ	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
BILLY	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
GANZ	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?

GANZ	Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
BILLY	He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.

BILLY	Hey, what about me?
GANZ	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.

CANDY	I'm candy...
HAMMOND	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
CANDY	Hey, what kind of talk is that?
HAMMOND	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
CANDY	No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
HAMMOND	Goodbye.

CANDY	Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
HAMMOND	Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

CANDY	You're in a hurry.
HAMMOND	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
CANDY	You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
HAMMOND	No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
CANDY	What's the matter with my place?
HAMMOND	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

CANDY	Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
HAMMOND	Here's hoping, baby...

CANDY	Hello, again.
HAMMOND	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

HAMMOND	Here you go, baby.
CANDY	Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
HAMMOND	Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...

HAMMOND	I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
CANDY	Now you're talkin'. See ya...

CATES	I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
CASEY	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.

CATES	How about it?
CASEY	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...

CATES	I hear you've got visitors.
CASEY	Would you guys...
CATES	No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.

CATES	You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
CASEY	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
CATES	You're gonna help us take him.
CASEY	No chance.
CATES	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.

CATES	Where's ganz?
CASEY	In the back.  Down the other corridor.

CATES	You lying son of a bitch...
GANZ	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...

GANZ	After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
CATES	I don't think you're gonna make it.
GANZ	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...

GANZ	I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
CATES	You're done.  End of story.
GANZ	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.

HAMMOND	You got a name, cop?
CATES	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
HAMMOND	Sure, anything you want.

HAMMOND	You here to write my life story?
CATES	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.

CATES	Yeah, I noticed...
HAMMOND	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
CATES	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

CATES	Yeah?
HAMMOND	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
CATES	You're crazy.
HAMMOND	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
CATES	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
HAMMOND	I got a lot to protect.
CATES	Bullshit.
HAMMOND	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
CATES	I'll think about it.

CATES	This prison gives out $400 suits?
HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.

CATES	We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
HAMMOND	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...

CATES	I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
HAMMOND	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.

HAMMOND	Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
CATES	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
HAMMOND	No way to start a partnership.
CATES	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
HAMMOND	Shit.  I'm already sorry.

CATES	Yeah.
HAMMOND	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.

CATES	Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
HAMMOND	Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
CATES	Luther was part of the gang?
HAMMOND	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
CATES	I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
HAMMOND	Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.

CATES	I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
HAMMOND	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
CATES	I may call you worse than that.

HAMMOND	Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
CATES	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
HAMMOND	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
CATES	I'm helpin' you, huh?

HAMMOND	Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
CATES	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
HAMMOND	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
CATES	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

CATES	Hey, this works pretty good.
HAMMOND	Thank you.
CATES	Want to try it again?

CATES	What do you think?
HAMMOND	I think you better put him on ice, man.
CATES	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
HAMMOND	If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?

CATES	We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
HAMMOND	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
CATES	Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
HAMMOND	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
CATES	We eat when I say we eat.
HAMMOND	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
CATES	Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
HAMMOND	Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.

HAMMOND	Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
CATES	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

HAMMOND	You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
CATES	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

CATES	Now, where we goin', convict?
HAMMOND	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.

CATES	I don't give out the details.
HAMMOND	Last night, two nights ago, three?

CATES	Last night.
HAMMOND	You have a good time?

CATES	Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
HAMMOND	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?

CATES	Well?
HAMMOND	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
CATES	This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
HAMMOND	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
CATES	If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
HAMMOND	But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
CATES	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...

HAMMOND	I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
CATES	You need five years training to handle a joint like...

HAMMOND	Hey, you wanna bet?
CATES	I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
HAMMOND	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
CATES	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
HAMMOND	That's never been one of my problems.

CATES	I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?
CATES	You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
HAMMOND	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
CATES	The bet's off.

CATES	I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
HAMMOND	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.

HAMMOND	This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
CATES	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.

HAMMOND	That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
CATES	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.

HAMMOND	You made that move, huh?
CATES	While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

CATES	There.
HAMMOND	Must be billy's girl.
CATES	Come on.

CATES	Let's go.
HAMMOND	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...

CATES	This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
HAMMOND	You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
CATES	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
HAMMOND	I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
CATES	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...

HAMMOND	Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
CATES	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...

CATES	Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
HAMMOND	Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
CATES	They saved your ass, convict.
HAMMOND	One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.

HAMMOND	I been waiting a long time for some money.
CATES	How much?
HAMMOND	Half a million.
CATES	Jesus.

CATES	Just tell me about the money.
HAMMOND	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
CATES	He's after your money.
HAMMOND	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

HAMMOND	We split 50-50?
CATES	Not likely, convict.
HAMMOND	You gonna let me keep any of it?
CATES	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

CATES	Where's the money?
HAMMOND	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?

CATES	Right, partner.
HAMMOND	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
CATES	Yeah.  Right.

CATES	Where's the goddamn car?
HAMMOND	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?

HAMMOND	This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
CATES	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
HAMMOND	You just drove by it.

CATES	You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
HAMMOND	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
CATES	Shit.

CATES	You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
HAMMOND	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
CATES	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.

HAMMOND	What?
CATES	Musta got some primo bondsman.
HAMMOND	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.

HAMMOND	Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
CATES	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
HAMMOND	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.

CATES	You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
HAMMOND	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
CATES	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
HAMMOND	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
CATES	Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?

CATES	I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
HAMMOND	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
CATES	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.

HAMMOND	Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
CATES	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
HAMMOND	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
CATES	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
HAMMOND	You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...

CATES	Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
HAMMOND	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

HAMMOND	A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
CATES	Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...

HAMMOND	You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
CATES	What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
HAMMOND	No class...
CATES	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.

HAMMOND	We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
CATES	Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?

HAMMOND	That was in style a couple years back, man.
CATES	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.

HAMMOND	Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
CATES	You stay with me...
HAMMOND	No way...

HAMMOND	Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
CATES	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?

CATES	Where's luther?
HAMMOND	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
CATES	Hello. And goodbye.

CATES	What about Luther?
HAMMOND	What about Ganz?

CATES	We missed.
HAMMOND	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
CATES	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
HAMMOND	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.

HAMMOND	They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
CATES	So you took the rest of the night off...

CATES	Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
HAMMOND	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...

CATES	I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
HAMMOND	You sure that's the reason?

CATES	Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
HAMMOND	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
CATES	Yeah. Guess not.

CATES	Yeah, I see her.
HAMMOND	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.

CATES	That was quick.
HAMMOND	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
CATES	Why?
HAMMOND	Luther's on the move...

HAMMOND	Notice something funny about that bus?
CATES	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

HAMMOND	Hey, how'd my car get here?
CATES	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
HAMMOND	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
CATES	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

HAMMOND	Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
CATES	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
HAMMOND	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

HAMMOND	It's late, they're closing...
CATES	Don't worry about it.

CATES	Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
HAMMOND	Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...

HAMMOND	Do I get to kiss her too?
CATES	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.

HAMMOND	What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
CATES	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.

HAMMOND	Hey, there she is...
CATES	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
HAMMOND	If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
CATES	Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
HAMMOND	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
CATES	Partnership?
HAMMOND	Well, you got to admit we come a long way.

CATES	You okay?
HAMMOND	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
CATES	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...

CATES	Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
HAMMOND	Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

HAMMOND	Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
CATES	There's nothin' to talk about.

CATES	It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
HAMMOND	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
CATES	That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
HAMMOND	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
CATES	No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
HAMMOND	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.

CATES	Thanks.
HAMMOND	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?

CATES	I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
HADEN	Yeah, I read the report...

CATES	Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
HADEN	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.

CATES	Yeah...
HADEN	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
CATES	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
HADEN	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
CATES	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
HADEN	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
CATES	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
HADEN	Jack?
CATES	Yeah?
HADEN	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
CATES	I'll keep it in mind.

HADEN	What the bell happened?
CATES	I lost them, that's what happened.
HADEN	How did they get away?
CATES	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.

HADEN	Which one pulled the trigger?
CATES	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
HADEN	You couldn't get to him?

HADEN	What a screw-up.
CATES	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.

HADEN	Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
CATES	I didn't have the time.
HADEN	Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.

CATES	He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
HADEN	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

HADEN	Where the Christ do you think you're going?
CATES	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

YOUNG COP	That's what you say, Cates...
CATES	Yeah.
YOUNG COP	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
CATES	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

YOUNG COP	Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
CATES	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
YOUNG COP	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...

CATES	Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
KEHOE	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
CATES	I'll help you out.

KEHOE	This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
CATES	Shit.

CATES	Billy Bear...
KEHOE	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.

CATES	Who are all these?
KEHOE	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
CATES	Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
KEHOE	Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

CATES	Tell me that's not the same guy.
KEHOE	Hey ... Dick Tracy.

CATES	I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
KEHOE	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
CATES	One of  em's in the slam.

KEHOE	You look awful.
CATES	So do you...been a long day.
KEHOE	Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
CATES	Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
KEHOE	Doesn't look like it.
CATES	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
KEHOE	Nothing.

CATES	Bullshit red tape.
KEHOE	I'm heading out. How about you?

CATES	I got to wait for a call.
KEHOE	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...

KEHOE	I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
CATES	What?

CATES	Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
KEHOE	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.

LUTHER	A cop...
CATES	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
LUTHER	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
CATES	You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
LUTHER	Who gives a fuck what you think?

LUTHER	Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
CATES	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
LUTHER	I don't know.

LUTHER	He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
CATES	When? How?
LUTHER	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

ELAINE	What am I wanted for?
CATES	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...

ELAINE	I don't think your gun's loaded...
CATES	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
ELAINE	I still don't think it's loaded.

CATES	Hey, you're right.
ELAINE	You're hopeless.
CATES	That's the way I see it, too.

ELAINE	I'm all wet.
CATES	What's wrong with that?

ELAINE	A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
CATES	What'd you do?
ELAINE	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
CATES	I guess he got the message...
ELAINE	Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
CATES	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
ELAINE	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
CATES	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
ELAINE	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
CATES	Hey, you know what I really think?
ELAINE	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
CATES	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.

ELAINE	You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
CATES	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?

CATES	Maybe you ought to buy me one.
ELAINE	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.

ELAINE	That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
CATES	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
ELAINE	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
CATES	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

ELAINE	When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
CATES	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
ELAINE	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.

ELAINE	You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
CATES	That's the way I see it, too.
ELAINE	Call me later.
CATES	You sure you want me to?
ELAINE	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

CATES	Thanks for the coffee.
ELAINE	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
CATES	Guess people ought to know who I am...

ELAINE	Great place for lunch.
CATES	Yeah, one of my favorites.
ELAINE	You made the front page.

CATES	Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
ELAINE	Jack, are you okay?
CATES	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...

ELAINE	Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
CATES	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
ELAINE	Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
CATES	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
ELAINE	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
CATES	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
ELAINE	I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.

ELAINE	Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
CATES	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.

CATES	Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
ELAINE	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.

ELAINE	I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
CATES	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
ELAINE	No wonder you're so popular.
CATES	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
ELAINE	So am I.

CATES	The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
ELAINE	Jack?  What was that?

CATES	Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
ELAINE	Jack, wait...
CATES	Just a second, that's all!

ELAINE	Hello.
CATES	Hi, it's me...
ELAINE	Fuck you.

ELAINE	Hey, I don't believe it.
CATES	Hiya, kid.
ELAINE	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
CATES	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
ELAINE	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
CATES	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...

ELAINE	You real down?
CATES	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.

CATES	Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
ELAINE	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
CATES	How do you know?
ELAINE	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

ELAINE	What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
CATES	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
ELAINE	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
CATES	So what?
ELAINE	When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
CATES	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
ELAINE	Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.

CATES	Whaddya think?
ELAINE	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
CATES	Let's go, Reggie.

ELAINE	How'd they take it back at headquarters?
CATES	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
ELAINE	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
CATES	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

CATES	Three more hours...
ELAINE	Where is he?
CATES	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
ELAINE	Tell me.
CATES	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.

ELAINE	You're impossible...
CATES	That's what I always say.

ELAINE	Who the hell are you?
HAMMOND	Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

ELAINE	I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
HAMMOND	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
ELAINE	Shrink major, not a shrink.

HAMMOND	Hard man to live with.
ELAINE	How would you know?
HAMMOND	Hey, two days with him is enough.
ELAINE	That's no bull.

HAMMOND	He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
ELAINE	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?

LISA	Hey...
GANZ	Shut up.
LISA	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.

LISA	What do you want?  What's goin' on?
GANZ	Shut up.

GANZ	Stall.
LISA	What do you want?

GANZ	Keep stallin'.
LISA	Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

GANZ	How hot are they?
HENRY	Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.

GANZ	How ya doin'?
HENRY	Can't complain.
GANZ	We got a lot to talk about.
HENRY	Yeah, old times.
GANZ	We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
HENRY	Sure, right.

GANZ	Surprise, Luther.
LUTHER	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
GANZ	I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
LUTHER	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
GANZ	You want that Indian to snap her neck?

GANZ	Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
LUTHER	Don't give me this, we were partners.
GANZ	Billy, go ahead, break it...
LUTHER	No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
GANZ	When?
LUTHER	I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
GANZ	You chickenshit punk...
LUTHER	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...

LUTHER	Come on, you can trust me. Please.
GANZ	You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.

LUTHER	Let her go.
GANZ	First, the money.

LUTHER	Rosalie, you okay?
GANZ	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.

HAMMOND	How you doing, man?
SOSNA	Not bad, not bad.

SOSNA	You want to go outside?
HAMMOND	Naw, right here's okay.

SOSNA	You sure?
HAMMOND	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

HAMMOND	How about some ammo?
SOSNA	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

HAMMOND	How much?
SOSNA	This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
HAMMOND	Don't mess with me. How much?
SOSNA	Five bills.
HAMMOND	Five.  On credit.
SOSNA	This ain't a credit business.

HAMMOND	Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
SOSNA	Give it back.
HAMMOND	Try and take it.

SOSNA	Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
HAMMOND	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.

ALICE	It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
ROSE	Well, you aren't the President, dear.
ALICE	Yeah, no duh.

ROSE	You don't want to say hi to your father?
ALICE	I'm sure he's busy.
ROSE	Don't you even want to ask?

ALICE	Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
ROSE	Alice...
ALICE	Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
ROSE	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
ALICE	Back at The Fishbowl?

ROSE	We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
ALICE	I know, Mom.  It was great... really.

ALICE	He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
ROSE	I'm sorry, honey.
ALICE	No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?

ALICE	When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
ROSE	Your father never means to be so...
ALICE	I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
ROSE	Some kids were teasing you?
ALICE	That's not really the point.

ROSE	You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
ALICE	Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.

ALICE	Mom?
ROSE	Yes dear?
ALICE	I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.

ALICE	Daddy. Daddy, please...
ROSE	Jim... for godsake!

ALICE	I don't drink coffee.
KORSHUNOV	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
ALICE	No, thank you. The gunfire did that.

ALICE	You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
KORSHUNOV	So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
ALICE	Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
KORSHUNOV	Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
ALICE	Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.

ALICE	The woman you shot. She was my friend.
KORSHUNOV	That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?

ALICE	Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
KORSHUNOV	It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.

ALICE	He didn't leave us.
KORSHUNOV	You are a resilient man, Mr.

ALICE	Oooooh, I'm good.
MARSHALL	Hey, you guys back already?

MARSHALL	How was...  ...the ballet?
ALICE	It was the experience of a lifetime.
MARSHALL	How `bout a hug for the old man.

MARSHALL	Alice!
ALICE	Daddy...

ALICE	Daddy...
MARSHALL	Alice... I...

MARSHALL	How you doing, sweetie?
ALICE	Been better, Dad... You?

ALICE	Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
MARSHALL	It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.

ALICE	There they are!
MARSHALL	Okay, I'm slowing us down.

IRAQI SOLDIER	The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
CERALLOS	Did we warn them off?
IRAQI SOLDIER	Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.

CERALLOS	It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
IRAQI SOLDIER	They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
CERALLOS	The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.

IRAQI SOLDIER	The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
CERALLOS	Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.

CHIEF MECHANIC	Do you see the maintenance panel?
MARSHALL	Got it.
CHIEF MECHANIC	Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
MARSHALL	Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
CHIEF MECHANIC	Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?

MARSHALL	It's cut.
CHIEF MECHANIC	cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.

MARSHALL	U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
COL. CARLTON	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.

COL. CARLTON	Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
MARSHALL	You read my mind.
COL. CARLTON	Put your pilot on.
MARSHALL	He's busy being dead.

COL. CARLTON	Who's flying the fucking plane?
MARSHALL	I'm doing what I can.

COL. CARLTON	Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
COL. CARLTON	Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
MARSHALL	Got it.
COL. CARLTON	Stay cool.

MARSHALL	How we doing, Colonel?
COL. CARLTON	We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.

MARSHALL	Uh, we got a problem here.
COL. CARLTON	Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
MARSHALL	No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
COL. CARLTON	Lemme take a look.

COL. CARLTON	Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
MARSHALL	Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
COL. CARLTON	Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD	He's dead then. They must have killed him.
DEAN	We don't know that.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD	Walter, if you have a point, make it.
DEAN	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD	They aren't answering their hails.
DEAN	This doesn't make sense.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD	They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
DEAN	I prefered the terrorists.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.

DOHERTY	Sir, you threw out page two.
MARSHALL	Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
DOHERTY	It was a good ad-lib, sir.
MARSHALL	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

DOHERTY	Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
MARSHALL	Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.

DOHERTY	The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
MARSHALL	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD	General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
V.P. CHANDLER	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?

V.P. CHANDLER	Can we do that?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.

V.P. CHANDLER	But they start executing hostages in
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
V.P. CHANDLER	Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.

V.P. CHANDLER	They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.

V.P. CHANDLER	If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
V.P. CHANDLER	If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.

V.P. CHANDLER	The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD	To swear you in as President.

MARSHALL	Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
GIBBS	Yes, Mr. President.
MARSHALL	Why?
GIBBS	Because it is my duty.
MARSHALL	You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
GIBBS	My loyalty was never to my country.

KC-135 PILOT	Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
GIBBS	About goddamn time.
KC-135 PILOT	Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
GIBBS	Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.

KC-135 PILOT	Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
GIBBS	Roger.

GIBBS	That's affirmative.
KC-135 PILOT	Ga get it.

KORSHUNOV	We've already been inspected.
GIBBS	Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.

KORSHUNOV	The rest of the secret service?
GIBBS	Dead.
KORSHUNOV	How many others killed?
GIBBS	Nine.
KORSHUNOV	Any of us?

KORSHUNOV	Who did this?
GIBBS	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
KORSHUNOV	A secret service agent. It must be.

KORSHUNOV	Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
GIBBS	why did they do that?
KORSHUNOV	Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
GIBBS	Well it worked.

KORSHUNOV	How?
GIBBS	Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
KORSHUNOV	Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.

GIBBS	We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
KORSHUNOV	We're not going to make it.
GIBBS	Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
KORSHUNOV	Where are we now?
GIBBS	Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
KORSHUNOV	No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.

KC-LO PILOT	Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
TOWER	Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.

TOWER	Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
KC-LO PILOT	Stand by.
TOWER	Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.

KC-LO PILOT	We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
TOWER	Tower, here.
KC-LO PILOT	This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
TOWER	Copy, Air Force One.

KORSHUNOV	Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
MITCHELL	The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.

MITCHELL	Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
KORSHUNOV	This is a remarkable aircraft.
MITCHELL	You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
KORSHUNOV	A dubious distinction, no?
MITCHELL	I guess it depends on your perspective.

KORSHUNOV	And all these rooms here?
MITCHELL	Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.

MITCHELL	Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
KORSHUNOV	Thank you.

KORSHUNOV	*                     Please tell me your name.
MITCHELL	Maria... Maria Mitchell.
KORSHUNOV	And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.

MITCHELL	I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
KORSHUNOV	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
MITCHELL	Scared. We're scared.

MITCHELL	You're pointing a gun at me.
KORSHUNOV	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.

KORSHUNOV	Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
ROSE	What do you want with us?
KORSHUNOV	Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.

KORSHUNOV	Now, or he dies, please.
ROSE	Come on, Alice.

ROSE	Leave my daughter alone.
KORSHUNOV	Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
ROSE	What do you know of my husband?
KORSHUNOV	I know he left you behind.
ROSE	My husband is a very courageous man.
KORSHUNOV	Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.

ROSE	Do you have to be so brutal?
KORSHUNOV	Yes
ROSE	Why? Do you enjoy it?
KORSHUNOV	I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
ROSE	How can you? I mean they're people.

KORSHUNOV	But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
ROSE	That was war.
KORSHUNOV	So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.

KORSHUNOV	Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
ROSE	No.
KORSHUNOV	Say something dear.

ROSE	Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV	You will be the first to pay for that mistake.

KORSHUNOV	The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
ROSE	Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.

KORSHUNOV	Four...
ROSE	Jim...
KORSHUNOV	Three...

ROSE	You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
KORSHUNOV	You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.

KORSHUNOV	Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
MARSHALL	Over my dead body.
KORSHUNOV	No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.

MARSHALL	She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
KORSHUNOV	Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.

MARSHALL	This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

MARSHALL	Stop.
KORSHUNOV	You'll do it?
MARSHALL	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
KORSHUNOV	Good. Good.

MARSHALL	Someday, you'll regret my nature.
KORSHUNOV	You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to

KORSHUNOV	The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
MARSHALL	One thing I've learned as

KORSHUNOV	There goes your ride.
MARSHALL	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
KORSHUNOV	If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.

KORSHUNOV	No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
MARSHALL	Hold on, Alice.

LEE	Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
V.P. CHANDLER	Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
LEE	Twenty minutes?
V.P. CHANDLER	You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.

LEE	Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
V.P. CHANDLER	Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.

LEE	Finally, we can bargain.
V.P. CHANDLER	I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.

MAJOR CALDWELL	Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
MARSHALL	They've gotta be joking.

MAJOR CALDWELL	The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
MARSHALL	Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.

MARSHALL	Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
MAJOR CALDWELL	Gravity.

MARSHALL	We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
MAJOR CALDWELL	We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
MARSHALL	They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.

MARSHALL	Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
MAJOR CALDWELL	Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
MARSHALL	Got it.

MARSHALL	I'll not going without my family.
MAJOR CALDWELL	Yes, sir.

MAJOR CALDWELL	Sir, we stay with the President.
MARSHALL	That isn't necessary.

ROSE	May I speak to you for a moment?
MARSHALL	Can't it wait?
ROSE	No, Mr. President.  It can't.

ROSE	Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
MARSHALL	Rose, I don't have time for this.

ROSE	For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
MARSHALL	She's a big girl.  She understands.
ROSE	How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
MARSHALL	And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?

MARSHALL	You know what?
ROSE	What?
MARSHALL	I miss you. And I miss her.
ROSE	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
MARSHALL	I wish it were that easy...

MARSHALL	I'll make it up to you, I promise.
ROSE	I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
MARSHALL	This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.

ROSE	How did your speech go?
MARSHALL	Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.

MARSHALL	Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
ROSE	Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?

ROSE	I don't know why you stayed.
MARSHALL	Please... don't start with me.

MARSHALL	Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
ROSE	Both of you.

ROSE	What are you doing?
MARSHALL	Flying the plane.
ROSE	You haven't even driven a car since you took office.

SECRETARY	The fax machines.
MARSHALL	Excuse me?
SECRETARY	The fax machines.
MARSHALL	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
SECRETARY	No. I thought about this, Mr.

SECRETARY	Where are we sending it?
MARSHALL	White House Situation room.

MARSHALL	Someone should give you a raise.
SECRETARY	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.

MARSHALL	Did they say anything about my family?
V.P. CHANDLER	They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
MARSHALL	Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.

V.P. CHANDLER	and if that means negotiating...
MARSHALL	You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
V.P. CHANDLER	But this is different, sir. You're the President.

V.P. CHANDLER	Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
MARSHALL	Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?

MARSHALL	What's going on?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	We're under attack.
MARSHALL	Where's my family?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	We're handling it, sir.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT	One.
MARSHALL	But...
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	Two... THREE. GO!

SWITCHBOARD	White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
MARSHALL	Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
SWITCHBOARD	who can I say is calling?
MARSHALL	This is the President.
SWITCHBOARD	Yeah, right.
MARSHALL	Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
SWITCHBOARD	Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
MARSHALL	You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

SWITCHBOARD	Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
MARSHALL	Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
SWITCHBOARD	Thank you for calling the white House...
MARSHALL	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.

SHEPHERD	*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
MARSHALL	I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.

SHEPHERD	You wanna knock of f?
MARSHALL	No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
SHEPHERD	He and the NRA don't like the wording.

SHEPHERD	With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
MARSHALL	I might still have a few chips left.
SHEPHERD	*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
MARSHALL	This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
SHEPHERD	Other way around, sir.
MARSHALL	Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.

MARSHALL	It's bait.  Don't take it.
SHEPHERD	Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
MARSHALL	Did we tape the Duke game?

MARSHALL	I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
SHEPHERD	We'll just say it was in bad taste.

SHEPHERD	You give me ulcers.
MARSHALL	That's my job.

MARSHALL	Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
SHEPHERD	Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD	Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
MARSHALL	Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?

SHEPHERD	Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
MARSHALL	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?

MARSHALL	Shepherd.
SHEPHERD	Sir...

MARSHALL	My god. I think that was a MiG.
SHEPHERD	A MiG? Where the hell are we?

SHEPHERD	Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
MARSHALL	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

MARSHALL	Shit.
SHEPHERD	How long's it been since you flew, sir?
MARSHALL	Twenty-five years.

SHEPHERD	Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
MARSHALL	They better. Fuel's almost gone.

SHEPHERD	IT'S OPEN!
MARSHALL	DO YOU SEE TEEM?

SHEPHERD	WE'RE HOOKED!
MARSHALL	We're hooked. Hove into position.

AUSTIN	You seem surprised to see me.
ALOTTA	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
AUSTIN	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
ALOTTA	What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
AUSTIN	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
ALOTTA	You may.
AUSTIN	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
ALOTTA	Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
AUSTIN	I didn't, baby, you just told me.
ALOTTA	It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
AUSTIN	Behave!

ALOTTA	Come in.
AUSTIN	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
ALOTTA	Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.

ALOTTA	May I wash you?
AUSTIN	Groovy.

ALOTTA	In Japan, men come first and women come second.
AUSTIN	Or sometimes not at all.
ALOTTA	Care for some saki?
AUSTIN	Sak-i it to me!

ALOTTA	How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

AUSTIN	'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
ALOTTA	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
AUSTIN	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
ALOTTA	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
AUSTIN	To my health.
ALOTTA	Kiss me.

ALOTTA	Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
AUSTIN	Is it about my teeth?
ALOTTA	Yes.
AUSTIN	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
ALOTTA	I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
AUSTIN	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
ALOTTA	Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.

ANDY WARHOL	Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
AUSTIN	Hey, how are you?
ANDY WARHOL	Hungry.
AUSTIN	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.

ANDY WARHOL	I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
AUSTIN	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
ANDY WARHOL	Fifteen minutes of fame? I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
AUSTIN	Smashing!

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
AUSTIN	We know all that, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
AUSTIN	Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.

AUSTIN	Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Good luck, Austin.
AUSTIN	Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thank you.  Let's go, baby!

AUSTIN	Where am I?
BASIL EXPOSITION	You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
AUSTIN	WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
BASIL EXPOSITION	The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN	Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
BASIL EXPOSITION	You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
AUSTIN	Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
BASIL EXPOSITION	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
AUSTIN	Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
BASIL EXPOSITION	We won, Austin.
AUSTIN	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!

AUSTIN	When do I begin?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
AUSTIN	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
BASIL EXPOSITION	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Vanessa's one of our top agents.
AUSTIN	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thanks.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
AUSTIN	Right away, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Where is Vanessa, by the way?

AUSTIN	She's working on another lead right now.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Basil.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN	Oh, yes. Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION	There's one more thing, Austin.
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thank you.

AUSTIN	Hello, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other?
AUSTIN	Excuse me?
BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other thing you're scared of?
AUSTIN	Carnies.
BASIL EXPOSITION	What?
AUSTIN	Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
AUSTIN	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

BASIL EXPOSITION	My God, Austin, what have you done?
AUSTIN	That's not your mother, that's a man!

AUSTIN	I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
AUSTIN	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.

BASIL EXPOSITION	All right, Austin, I think you should go.
AUSTIN	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
AUSTIN	Yes, Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thanks.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
AUSTIN	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.

AUSTIN	Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, I have something for you as well.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
AUSTIN	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.

BASIL EXPOSITION	But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
AUSTIN	Yes Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful!

MICK JAGGER	Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
AUSTIN	Hey, Mick!
MICK JAGGER	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
AUSTIN	Well, you can't always get what you want.
MICK JAGGER	You can't always get what you want! That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
AUSTIN	Good on ya, man.
MICK JAGGER	Groovy!

DESTRUCTACON	Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
AUSTIN	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
DESTRUCTACON	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
AUSTIN	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
DESTRUCTACON	That does not compute.
AUSTIN	Why not? It's a question.
DESTRUCTACON	Love is... love is... love is...

AUSTIN	What's wrong with your hand?
DR. EVIL	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

AUSTIN	I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
DR. EVIL	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.

AUSTIN	Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
DR. EVIL	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.

AUSTIN	I've got you, Dr. Evil!
DR. EVIL	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
AUSTIN	No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
DR. EVIL	Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
AUSTIN	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
DR. EVIL	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.

AUSTIN	It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
DR. EVIL	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
AUSTIN	Man, you are one chilly square!

VANESSA	Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
AUSTIN	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
VANESSA	My mother's told me all about you.
AUSTIN	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
VANESSA	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.

AUSTIN	OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
VANESSA	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
AUSTIN	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.

AUSTIN	Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
VANESSA	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
AUSTIN	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
VANESSA	I beg your pardon?
AUSTIN	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
VANESSA	Excuse me?
AUSTIN	My wedding tackle.
VANESSA	I'm sorry?
AUSTIN	My meat and two veg.
VANESSA	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
AUSTIN	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
VANESSA	A Chigro?
AUSTIN	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
VANESSA	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
AUSTIN	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!

AUSTIN	Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
VANESSA	Sure.
AUSTIN	Do I make you horny?
VANESSA	What?
AUSTIN	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
VANESSA	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
VANESSA	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

AUSTIN	You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
VANESSA	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.

AUSTIN	Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
VANESSA	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
AUSTIN	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?

AUSTIN	Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
VANESSA	I'm sure.
AUSTIN	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.

AUSTIN	I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
VANESSA	Here, use mine.
AUSTIN	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.

AUSTIN	I can't see a bloody thing.
VANESSA	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.

VANESSA	Why did you leave so soon?
AUSTIN	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.

AUSTIN	Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
VANESSA	Do you want to talk to him?

AUSTIN	Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
VANESSA	Why?
AUSTIN	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.

VANESSA	A limousine has just pulled up.
AUSTIN	Let me see.

AUSTIN	Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
VANESSA	How do you know?
AUSTIN	I never forget a pussy... cat.

VANESSA	Let's go get him!
AUSTIN	He's too well-protected right now.
VANESSA	We can't just sit here, Austin.
AUSTIN	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
VANESSA	I don't get it.
AUSTIN	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
VANESSA	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
AUSTIN	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

VANESSA	I hate having my picture taken.
AUSTIN	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.

AUSTIN	Fancy a nibble?
VANESSA	I couldn't have another bite.

VANESSA	Watch out, you're on my hair!
AUSTIN	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
VANESSA	Go! Just go!

VANESSA	I haven't had fun like that since college.
AUSTIN	I'm sorry.
VANESSA	Why?
AUSTIN	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

VANESSA	Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
AUSTIN	No, this is me in a nutshell.

AUSTIN	You're smashed, Vanessa.
VANESSA	I am not.
AUSTIN	Oh, yes you are.
VANESSA	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.

AUSTIN	I can't. You're drunk.
VANESSA	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
AUSTIN	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

VANESSA	Really, Austin!
AUSTIN	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.

VANESSA	Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN	Of course, luv.
VANESSA	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
AUSTIN	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
VANESSA	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
AUSTIN	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
VANESSA	No, did you use a condom?
AUSTIN	Only sailors use condoms, man.
VANESSA	Not in the Nineties.
AUSTIN	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
VANESSA	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
AUSTIN	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
VANESSA	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.

AUSTIN	Hello, luv.
VANESSA	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
AUSTIN	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
VANESSA	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
AUSTIN	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
VANESSA	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.

AUSTIN	Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
VANESSA	Do you think she's prettier than I?
AUSTIN	Who?
VANESSA	You know who.
AUSTIN	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
VANESSA	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

VANESSA	Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
AUSTIN	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.

VANESSA	Thank God, Austin, we made it.
AUSTIN	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.

AUSTIN	Does that make you horny?
VANESSA	Not now, Austin.

AUSTIN	First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
VANESSA	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

AUSTIN	All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
AUSTIN	Smashing idea! Give it to me.

AUSTIN	Not a good time to lose one's head.
VANESSA	Indeed.
AUSTIN	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
VANESSA	Yes.
AUSTIN	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
VANESSA	Shut up.
AUSTIN	Fair enough.

VANESSA	What do we do now?
AUSTIN	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
VANESSA	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
AUSTIN	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
VANESSA	I'll hurry back.
AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
VANESSA	Austin, what's your point?
AUSTIN	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
VANESSA	Oh, behave!

AUSTIN	It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
VANESSA	Likewise.
AUSTIN	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
VANESSA	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
AUSTIN	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.

AUSTIN	Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
VANESSA	Are you crazy?
AUSTIN	Don't worry!

VANESSA	Austin, I'm coming with you.
AUSTIN	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
VANESSA	I'll secure the perimeter.

VANESSA	I have something to tell you.
AUSTIN	Lay it on me.
VANESSA	I love you, Austin.
AUSTIN	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
VANESSA	Kiss me.
AUSTIN	Behave!

CLERK	Danger Powers, personal effects.
AUSTIN	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
CLERK	It says here, name Danger Powers.
AUSTIN	Danger's my middle name.
CLERK	OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
AUSTIN	That's not mine.
CLERK	One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
AUSTIN	I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
CLERK	One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
AUSTIN	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
CLERK	One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.

GUARD	Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
AUSTIN	Sure.

AUSTIN	Everything seems to be in order.
GUARD	Hey, wait a minute--

AUSTIN	Here, have a piece of gum.
GUARD	Here, have a piece of gum.

AUSTIN	Don't mind if I do.
GUARD	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.

AUSTIN	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
GUARD	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
AUSTIN	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.

GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
AUSTIN	Where did you learn to shoot?

RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	Is it one of ours?
RADAR OPERATOR	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	What are you saying, son?
RADAR OPERATOR	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.

COMMANDER GILMOUR	Oh my God, he's back.
RADAR OPERATOR	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	Shut up.
RADAR OPERATOR	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
COMMANDER GILMOUR	What's its current position?

RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, I have to log it...
COMMANDER GILMOUR	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!

MUSTAFA	But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
DR. EVIL	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!

MUSTAFA	But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
DR. EVIL	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!

MUSTAFA	We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
DR. EVIL	Silence!

MUSTAFA	Ahhhhhhhhh!
DR. EVIL	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.

DR. EVIL	We've got a lot of work to do.
MUSTAFA	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
DR. EVIL	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
MUSTAFA	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
DR. EVIL	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.

MUSTAFA	Ow! You shot me!
DR. EVIL	Right. Okay. Moving on.
MUSTAFA	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--

FRAU FARBISSINA	Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
DR. EVIL	Yes.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
DR. EVIL	My son?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Yes.  Scott!

DR. EVIL	Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!

DR. EVIL	Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
FRAU FARBISSINA	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!

DR. EVIL	Quite impressive.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
DR. EVIL	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.

DR. EVIL	Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
FRAU FARBISSINA	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
DR. EVIL	Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.

DR. EVIL	What is it now?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
DR. EVIL	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Sea bass.
DR. EVIL	Right.
FRAU FARBISSINA	They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Please allow me to demonstrate.

THERAPIST	That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
DR. EVIL	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

DR. EVIL	No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
THERAPIST	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

DR. EVIL	Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
THERAPIST	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
DR. EVIL	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
THERAPIST	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.

SCOTT EVIL	Hi.
DR. EVIL	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
SCOTT EVIL	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!

DR. EVIL	But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
SCOTT EVIL	Not me.

DR. EVIL	An evil vet?
SCOTT EVIL	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
DR. EVIL	An evil petting zoo?
SCOTT EVIL	You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

DR. EVIL	Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
SCOTT EVIL	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
DR. EVIL	Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
SCOTT EVIL	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
DR. EVIL	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
SCOTT EVIL	Yeah. What?

DR. EVIL	Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
SCOTT EVIL	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
DR. EVIL	In due time.
SCOTT EVIL	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
DR. EVIL	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
SCOTT EVIL	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
DR. EVIL	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.

DR. EVIL	Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
SCOTT EVIL	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
DR. EVIL	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
SCOTT EVIL	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?

DR. EVIL	Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't want to.
DR. EVIL	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
SCOTT EVIL	Blow me.
DR. EVIL	What did you say?
SCOTT EVIL	Show me.

SCOTT EVIL	Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
DR. EVIL	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
SCOTT EVIL	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
DR. EVIL	Scott, don't say that...

NUMBER TWO	We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

NUMBER TWO	Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
DR. EVIL	People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.

NUMBER TWO	Umm, that also has already happened.
DR. EVIL	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO	Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
DR. EVIL	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO	Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
DR. EVIL	Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?

MRS. KENSINGTON	Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
VANESSA	Great.
MRS. KENSINGTON	How's Austin?
VANESSA	He's asleep.
MRS. KENSINGTON	You didn't...
VANESSA	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.

MRS. KENSINGTON	I'm proud of you.
VANESSA	Why?
MRS. KENSINGTON	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.

VANESSA	Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
MRS. KENSINGTON	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
VANESSA	What about his teeth?
MRS. KENSINGTON	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA	I just don't see it.
MRS. KENSINGTON	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
VANESSA	Did you ever...
MRS. KENSINGTON	Of course not. I was married to your father.
VANESSA	Did you ever want to?
MRS. KENSINGTON	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.

VANESSA	You didn't answer my question, Mum.
MRS. KENSINGTON	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.

MRS. KENSINGTON	No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
VANESSA	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
MRS. KENSINGTON	I love you, Vanessa.

THERAPIST	So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
SCOTT EVIL	Well, it's kind of weird.
THERAPIST	We don't judge here.
SCOTT EVIL	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
THERAPIST	And how do you feel about that?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't wanna take over the family business.

THERAPIST	What do you want to do, Scott?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

THERAPIST	We don't label people here, Scott.
SCOTT EVIL	No, he's really evil.
THERAPIST	Scott.

SCOTT EVIL	I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
THERAPIST	OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

AXE	Oh these moments do try me...
STEPHEN	Be gentle.

AXE	Wash it to the windows?
STEPHEN	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
AXE	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
STEPHEN	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.

AXE	That's Franny. She likes firemen.
STEPHEN	Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.

AXE	Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
STEPHEN	No.  I need a drink.

STEPHEN	You know Knowlton pretty well?
AXE	Yeah...
STEPHEN	Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?

AXE	Biggest in two battalions.
STEPHEN	We're gonna be okay, man...

STEPHEN	Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
AXE	It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
STEPHEN	-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
AXE	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
STEPHEN	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!

AXE	Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
STEPHEN	-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
AXE	They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.

STEPHEN	-- Knock it off!
AXE	-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --

AXE	...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
STEPHEN	There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.

STEPHEN	You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
AXE	Stevie... I...

AXE	Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
BRIAN	My Lt. might have something to say about that.
AXE	Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
BRIAN	John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...

BRIAN	Is he...
AXE	He's alive.

BRIAN	Did you do it for Tim?
AXE	That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!

AXE	You gotta let me finish --
BRIAN	Just come down, John. Just --
AXE	-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!

BRIAN	-- He killed people --
AXE	-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
BRIAN	-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
AXE	-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --

STEPHEN	It doesn't go like that.
BRIAN	Who asked you?
STEPHEN	If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.

STEPHEN	Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
BRIAN	I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
STEPHEN	So you're going to fight fires now, huh?

STEPHEN	Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
BRIAN	Not likely.
STEPHEN	Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...

BRIAN	I like what you've done with the place.
STEPHEN	It's comin' along... want a beer?

BRIAN	Been ripping off fire stations?
STEPHEN	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

BRIAN	My God, an actual operating 8-track.
STEPHEN	What, you've never seen one before?
BRIAN	In the Field Museum once.
STEPHEN	It works.
BRIAN	It worked when you were in sixth grade.

STEPHEN	People actually used to pay you for this?
BRIAN	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
STEPHEN	Sheep don't count.
BRIAN	Yeah? What about Laura --
STEPHEN	That was never proved.

STEPHEN	Why'd you come here, Brian?
BRIAN	I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
STEPHEN	What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
BRIAN	Hey! You don't know me --
STEPHEN	I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
BRIAN	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
STEPHEN	Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.

BRIAN	There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
STEPHEN	Thanks for the speakers.

BRIAN	Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
STEPHEN	Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
BRIAN	I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
STEPHEN	I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.

STEPHEN	Ya love it, probie?
BRIAN	I'm in heaven, Lt.
STEPHEN	Hook us up to a stand-pipe.

STEPHEN	Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
BRIAN	-- C'mon, Stephen.
STEPHEN	-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.

BRIAN	Goddamn it Stephen!
STEPHEN	-- I told you to stay next to me!
BRIAN	-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
STEPHEN	What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.

STEPHEN	C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
BRIAN	-- Never mind.

BRIAN	Thanks.
STEPHEN	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.

STEPHEN	Hey.
BRIAN	Hey.

BRIAN	So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
STEPHEN	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?

STEPHEN	Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
BRIAN	C'mon, let's crawl home.

STEPHEN	Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
BRIAN	This?
STEPHEN	Yeah... too bright...

STEPHEN	Roll the hose.
BRIAN	What, are you kidding? By myself?

BRIAN	What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
STEPHEN	You got a problem with drilling, probie?
BRIAN	No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
STEPHEN	Roll the hose.

STEPHEN	Ready?
BRIAN	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
STEPHEN	Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.

STEPHEN	You okay?
BRIAN	I waited... I would have fucking waited...
STEPHEN	That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
BRIAN	Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
STEPHEN	You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?

STEPHEN	Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
BRIAN	Thanks for the insight.
STEPHEN	Brian, look --
BRIAN	Just leave me alone, okay?

STEPHEN	...Not now, Brian.
BRIAN	Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
STEPHEN	I had that fire. He didn't listen!
BRIAN	He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
STEPHEN	Fuck you.

STEPHEN	Hey, what are you doing here?
BRIAN	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
STEPHEN	So hello.

STEPHEN	Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
BRIAN	You're selling dad's boat?
STEPHEN	Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
BRIAN	I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
STEPHEN	Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
BRIAN	Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
STEPHEN	-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!

BRIAN	It's okay, Stephen, I --
STEPHEN	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...

BRIAN	I saw it.
STEPHEN	Saw what?
BRIAN	When dad died, I saw another fire...
STEPHEN	Everybody did.
BRIAN	I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
STEPHEN	...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
BRIAN	I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
STEPHEN	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
BRIAN	Sometimes right when you're looking at them.

BRIAN	Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
STEPHEN	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

BRIAN	-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
STEPHEN	-- What are you doing here?
BRIAN	I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
STEPHEN	I know.
BRIAN	How do you know?
STEPHEN	I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
BRIAN	-- What were they doing there?
STEPHEN	They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

STEPHEN	Anything else?
BRIAN	What are we going to do about this?
STEPHEN	I'll handle it.
BRIAN	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
STEPHEN	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.

BRIAN	You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
STEPHEN	Shut up!

STEPHEN	You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
BRIAN	You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --
STEPHEN	Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...

STEPHEN	Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
BRIAN	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.

JENNIFER	Brian.
BRIAN	Jennifer.
JENNIFER	You're back.
BRIAN	You look great.
JENNIFER	Thanks for calling.
BRIAN	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
JENNIFER	Huh.
BRIAN	So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
JENNIFER	Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
BRIAN	Yeah? What have you been up to?
JENNIFER	I work for city hall.
BRIAN	Really? No kidding.
JENNIFER	What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.

BRIAN	Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
JENNIFER	I don't want to be your friend, Brian.

BRIAN	With grenadine, right?
JENNIFER	When I was twenty.
BRIAN	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?

JENNIFER	Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
BRIAN	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
JENNIFER	Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
BRIAN	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
JENNIFER	Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
BRIAN	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
JENNIFER	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?

BRIAN	What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
JENNIFER	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
BRIAN	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.

JENNIFER	Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
BRIAN	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
JENNIFER	Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
BRIAN	So now you suddenly care about my future?
JENNIFER	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
BRIAN	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.

BRIAN	I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
JENNIFER	...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
BRIAN	Yeah...

BRIAN	Arson.
JENNIFER	Straightest answer your department's given me all week.

BRIAN	Hey.
JENNIFER	How's it going?
BRIAN	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
JENNIFER	Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
BRIAN	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.

JENNIFER	I could use a date.
BRIAN	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...

JENNIFER	Hi.
BRIAN	Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
JENNIFER	If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
BRIAN	Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
JENNIFER	You think that's really any of your business?
BRIAN	Well, you did invite me here.
JENNIFER	Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.

BRIAN	Okay.
JENNIFER	Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
BRIAN	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
JENNIFER	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
BRIAN	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
JENNIFER	But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
BRIAN	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.

BRIAN	Thanks for the invite.
JENNIFER	Got anything to drink in there?
BRIAN	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.

BRIAN	This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
JENNIFER	Homey.
BRIAN	See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
JENNIFER	Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
BRIAN	When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
JENNIFER	Then why did you quit?
BRIAN	I wanted to be a good one.

BRIAN	Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
JENNIFER	Uh huh.

JENNIFER	Brian. What's wrong?
BRIAN	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
JENNIFER	I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
BRIAN	-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
JENNIFER	Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
BRIAN	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
JENNIFER	I was doing my job.
BRIAN	Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
JENNIFER	Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
BRIAN	Leave Stephen out of this --
JENNIFER	Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
BRIAN	-- I work for the city.
JENNIFER	You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.

JENNIFER	Hi.
BRIAN	Hi.
JENNIFER	We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
BRIAN	Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
JENNIFER	I don't know anything about it.
BRIAN	You could check. It'd be in his files.
JENNIFER	Do you know what you're asking me to do?
BRIAN	Yes.
JENNIFER	Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
BRIAN	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

BRIAN	What is --
JENNIFER	Just take it.

BRIAN	I'm sorry.
JENNIFER	That's a dumb thing to say.
BRIAN	You're right.

BRIAN	I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
JENNIFER	I quit two days ago, Brian.
BRIAN	What'll you do?
JENNIFER	I don't have the slightest idea...
BRIAN	I'll see ya around, huh?
JENNIFER	It's a small town.

RONALD	Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
BRIAN	Hey, do I know you?

BRIAN	I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
RONALD	So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...

RONALD	Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
BRIAN	Who's doing this?
RONALD	Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
BRIAN	Then who --
RONALD	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
BRIAN	I don't have a story.
RONALD	Sure you do.

RONALD	Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
BRIAN	What?
RONALD	You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
BRIAN	I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
RONALD	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
BRIAN	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
RONALD	Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
BRIAN	The outlets.
RONALD	That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
BRIAN	Trychticholorate.
RONALD	Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?

BRIAN	Who the fuck is doing this?
RONALD	After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...

BRIAN	Oh Jesus Christ...
RONALD	Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?

BRIAN	If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
BRIAN	I want another shot, Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
BRIAN	If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
CHIEF FITZGERALD	-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
BRIAN	I need another one, sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
BRIAN	No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD	Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
BRIAN	See you Monday. Sir.

BRIAN	Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
SHADOW	Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.

SHADOW	Are you still here?
BRIAN	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
SHADOW	Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
BRIAN	I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
SHADOW	Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?

BRIAN	Where are you going?
SHADOW	Pest control.

SHADOW	-- Shhh.
BRIAN	What are you listening to?

SHADOW	So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
BRIAN	Glass?
SHADOW	Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.

SHADOW	Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
BRIAN	-- Another backdraft.

SHADOW	Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
BRIAN	No it couldn't.

BRIAN	Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
SHADOW	I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...

SHADOW	Read.
BRIAN	Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --
SHADOW	-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
BRIAN	During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium.
SHADOW	Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!

SHADOW	Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
BRIAN	Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.

SHADOW	Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
BRIAN	And the putty around the door?
SHADOW	Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
BRIAN	But the right guess on this is arson.
SHADOW	I don't guess.
BRIAN	Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
SHADOW	I don't work for them, either.

SHADOW	That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
BRIAN	What?
SHADOW	I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
BRIAN	But he killed these guys.
SHADOW	But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
BRIAN	What reason?
SHADOW	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
BRIAN	That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
SHADOW	No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
BRIAN	Are you going public with this?
SHADOW	No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.

SHADOW	What the hell are you doing here?
BRIAN	I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

SHADOW	In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
BRIAN	Fire.

BRIAN	Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
SHADOW	Son of a bitch. They knew each other.

BRIAN	So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
SHADOW	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
BRIAN	Nice bunch of guys.
SHADOW	Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.

SHADOW	This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
BRIAN	Yeah? Airtight?

BRIAN	I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
SHADOW	Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
BRIAN	Then who wrote the report?
SHADOW	It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

SHADOW	Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
BRIAN	How ya feeling?

BRIAN	Did you pull me out?
SHADOW	Yeah.
BRIAN	Did I say thanks?
SHADOW	No.
BRIAN	Just wondering.
SHADOW	I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...

BRIAN	So what do you want me to do?
SHADOW	I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

SHADOW	Your brother was a good man.
BRIAN	Yeah.
SHADOW	Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
BRIAN	Like it never happened...

HELEN	Brian?
BRIAN	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
HELEN	You look like... Brian.

HELEN	'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
BRIAN	Four months.
HELEN	Four months?
BRIAN	I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

BRIAN	That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
HELEN	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
BRIAN	Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
HELEN	Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

BRIAN	Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
HELEN	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

BRIAN	Oh, man, I'm sorry.
HELEN	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

BRIAN	Yeah. Big fan.
SWAYZAK	And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
BRIAN	Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
SWAYZAK	No need to be modest, Brian.
BRIAN	No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
SWAYZAK	-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
BRIAN	Every little boy's fantasy.
SWAYZAK	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
BRIAN	I have a job.
SWAYZAK	This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
BRIAN	Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
SWAYZAK	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.

SWAYZAK	Mr. McCaffrey...
BRIAN	Nice boat.
SWAYZAK	It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.

SWAYZAK	Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
BRIAN	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.

BRIAN	Completely out of control.
TIM	What the hell are we waiting for?

TIM	Aren't you even curious?
BRIAN	Engine 115, right?
TIM	How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
BRIAN	Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
TIM	You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
BRIAN	Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
TIM	Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?

TIM	Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
BRIAN	Backdraft.

BRIAN	Do you have to do that?
TIM	Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.

TIM	Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
BRIAN	Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.

BRIAN	What?
TIM	Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death...

BRIAN	So, you surviving without me?
TIM	There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
BRIAN	Swayzak's not my boss.

WILLY	Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
BRIAN	It's in my blood, Willy.

WILLY	Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
BRIAN	Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
WILLY	Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
BRIAN	Management were pin heads.
WILLY	Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards?
BRIAN	Coffee sucked.
WILLY	And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
BRIAN	I was ahead of my time.
WILLY	You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...

DENNIS	Who's going to die?
STEPHEN	Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
DENNIS	Well, let's have a look.

DENNIS	Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
STEPHEN	And DIE!

STEPHEN	Fireman shit?
DENNIS	Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
STEPHEN	Firehouse.
DENNIS	Cute.

STEPHEN	Dad!
DENNIS	You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?

GRINDLE	I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
STEPHEN	Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.

GRINDLE	Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
STEPHEN	I'm busy.
GRINDLE	He just wants to --
STEPHEN	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

GRINDLE	We gotta roll, Stevie...
STEPHEN	I'll be there.
GRINDLE	They're waitin' man.
STEPHEN	I'll be there, goddamn it!

STEPHEN	Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
HELEN	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?

STEPHEN	You can't talk about my brother like that...
HELEN	Here we go...

HELEN	Stephen, what are you doing here?
STEPHEN	Fixing my roof.
HELEN	It's not your roof anymore.

STEPHEN	Where's Sean?
HELEN	He's got piano lessons.
STEPHEN	Oh yeah? How's he doing?
HELEN	He's going to be a fireman.
STEPHEN	Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
HELEN	Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
STEPHEN	I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
HELEN	-- You remember.
STEPHEN	Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
HELEN	The great communicator.
STEPHEN	Sorry I hit Jackson.
HELEN	He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
STEPHEN	He treats you okay?
HELEN	Okay.
STEPHEN	I treated you better.
HELEN	You treated me like shit.

HELEN	You want some coffee?
STEPHEN	Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
HELEN	What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
STEPHEN	He's out.
HELEN	I know he's out, but how's he doing?
STEPHEN	Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
HELEN	Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
STEPHEN	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
HELEN	Yeah? When was the last time?
STEPHEN	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
HELEN	You can't keep being his father...

STEPHEN	I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
HELEN	What's wrong?
STEPHEN	I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.

STEPHEN	Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
HELEN	Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...

STEPHEN	Look, I'm sorry I --
HELEN	-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
STEPHEN	-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
HELEN	I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.

RICCO	They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
SHADOW	Putty? On both doors?
RICCO	There's something else kinda interesting...

RICCO	Anyway, down here, take a look...
SHADOW	McCaffrey, hold this for us.

RICCO	See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
SHADOW	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
RICCO	Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
SHADOW	What the hell was it doing in the fire?
RICCO	That's your job.

RONALD	Shadow.
SHADOW	How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
RONALD	Didn't think you'd make it.
SHADOW	Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
RONALD	Who's this?
SHADOW	He works for me.
RONALD	Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
SHADOW	You like everybody, Ronald.

SHADOW	You don't know him.
RONALD	I know you.

SHADOW	Knock it off. Now.
RONALD	Tell him about me, Shadow?
SHADOW	Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
RONALD	Did he tell you how we finally met?
SHADOW	Nobody cares, Ronald.
RONALD	Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...

SHADOW	Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
RONALD	Absolutely.

RONALD	-- Burn them.
SHADOW	And old ladies?
RONALD	-- Burn them.
SHADOW	And the world -- the whole world.
RONALD	-- Burn it all.

STEPHEN	Got a cause?
SHADOW	Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
STEPHEN	The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.

STEPHEN	I'm working on it.
SHADOW	I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
STEPHEN	...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
SHADOW	What do you listen to, Stephen?
STEPHEN	You don't know... nobody knows...
SHADOW	I might.

STEPHEN	It knows us. This one knows us.
SHADOW	I need that report, Lt.

SHADOW	Alderman Swayzak.
SWAYZAK	Investigator Rimgale.
SHADOW	I need to get in the trunk.

SWAYZAK	Inspector.
SHADOW	Alderman.

SWAYZAK	When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
SHADOW	Don?
SWAYZAK	Don't you have any leads at all?
SHADOW	No Marty, I don't.

SHADOW	We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
SWAYZAK	Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
SHADOW	Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.

SHADOW	Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
SWAYZAK	Just catch the son of a bitch.

SHADOW	Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
SWAYZAK	Investigator...

SWAYZAK	I'm a little busy right now --
SHADOW	This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --

CHARLIE	I think she got to you, pappy.
NICK	You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
CHARLIE	Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.

CHARLIE	... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
NICK	Thanks.

CHARLIE	Hey, hey, where you goin'?
NICK	Home.

CHARLIE	Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
NICK	-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

NICK	He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
CHARLIE	So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?

NICK	What's this?
CHARLIE	Let go...

CHARLIE	Back-up.
NICK	Get rid of it.
CHARLIE	Why?
NICK	It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
CHARLIE	I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.

CHARLIE	Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
NICK	Charlie...

CHARLIE	... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
NICK	-- I should tear your head off.
CHARLIE	Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
NICK	-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.

CHARLIE	What are they doing now?
NICK	Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
CHARLIE	Who do you think the Jap is?
NICK	Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
CHARLIE	I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.

NICK	Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
CHARLIE	What?

NICK	Frank Abolofia.
CHARLIE	The Wolf?

NICK	Some party.
CHARLIE	Maybe we should do something?
NICK	Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.

CHARLIE	What are you doing?
NICK	Saving your life.

CHARLIE	... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
NICK	I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
CHARLIE	What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
NICK	Beats forty hours on a plane.
CHARLIE	They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.

CHARLIE	I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
NICK	Not a prayer.
CHARLIE	Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.

NICK	What'd you say?
CHARLIE	Where is the subway station, please.

CHARLIE	Nick... You up?
NICK	No.

CHARLIE	Nick, have I been a good partner?
NICK	Number five with a bullet.

CHARLIE	I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
NICK	Go to sleep, Charlie.
CHARLIE	You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.

NICK	I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
CHARLIE	I didn't know.
NICK	The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.

NICK	Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
CHARLIE	Hey, when in Rome --
NICK	In Rome, I'll bow.

NICK	Let's go.
CHARLIE	Nick, we can't just --
NICK	I said let's go, Charlie.

CHARLIE	... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
NICK	Let's grab some food.
CHARLIE	First decent idea you've had.

CHARLIE	This should be it...
NICK	You said that in the last two places.

CHARLIE	This the right place?
NICK	I hope not.

CHARLIE	Getting very weird.
NICK	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
CHARLIE	Maybe we should bail?

NICK	It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
CHARLIE	I don't think he'd feel it.

CHARLIE	... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
NICK	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.

CHARLIE	Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
NICK	Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
CHARLIE	Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.

ICH	Squid?
CHARLIE	Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

ICH	Joyce can be nice.
CHARLIE	What'd she say?
ICH	That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.

CHARLIE	You cool, Ich?
ICH	Cool?
CHARLIE	You all right?  You okay?

CHARLIE	What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
ICH	What does Charlie mean?
CHARLIE	Hey, all right.

NICK	Short shift?
CONNIE	Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

CONNIE	It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
NICK	Connie...
CONNIE	All right, how's the new partner?
NICK	High spirits, desire, commitment.
CONNIE	You'll take care of that.
NICK	Give me a break, would you?
CONNIE	If you give me one.

NICK	Are you expecting anyone?
CONNIE	I wasn't expecting you.

NICK	Where do we start looking for this guy?
ICH	Where would you look for the mafia?

NICK	Where're you going, Ichiro?
ICH	The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.

ICH	Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
NICK	Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
ICH	No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
NICK	That's what you said in the last three piss pots.

ICH	... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
NICK	What's the problem here?

ICH	Nick!
NICK	Give us a break...
ICH	It's Ichiro.  Ich.
NICK	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!

NICK	You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
ICH	I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
NICK	Why the hell not?
ICH	I don't, that's all.

NICK	What happened?
ICH	They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.

ICH	It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
NICK	Why weren't you at the platform?
ICH	I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.

ICH	You must leave?
NICK	Yeah...
ICH	I'll get him for you, Nick.

ICH	I've continued working on the case!
NICK	I can see that.

NICK	How'd you get this?
ICH	I stole them.

NICK	Know her?
ICH	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
NICK	A snitch?

NICK	What's he saying?
ICH	He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.

ICH	Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
NICK	Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.

ICH	You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
NICK	No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
ICH	Nick...

NICK	What'd I tell you?
ICH	There she is!

NICK	Did I say that?
ICH	You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
NICK	Are we getting married?

NICK	You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
ICH	Sure.

ICH	Nick...
NICK	If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.

ICH	Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
NICK	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...

ICH	Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
NICK	Ichiro --
ICH	Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
NICK	Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

ICH	Yakuza.
NICK	Good.  Very good...

NICK	She disappeared... shit!
ICH	You were too far behind.

ICH	You can't come in.  They don't want --
NICK	Gaiijin.
ICH	I'll check it out.

NICK	If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
ICH	You can trust me.

ICH	I'm not drunk...
NICK	We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
ICH	Nick --
NICK	Shut-up.

ICH	... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
NICK	I want to yank Kobo.
ICH	Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.

NICK	Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
ICH	San is an honorable title.

ICH	Nick!
NICK	A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.

NICK	Where does this Sugai live?
ICH	A resort city, Beppu.
NICK	I want to go talk to him.
ICH	What...?  Why?
NICK	Because he knows how to get to our man.
ICH	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
NICK	I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

ICH	It's very small.
NICK	Big enough.
ICH	It's illegal, Nick.
NICK	It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
ICH	Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.

NICK	What's in the box?
ICH	For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
NICK	So I bring some cheese?

ICH	No...
NICK	Let's go.  Him first.
ICH	Nick, you can't do this.
NICK	It's done.  You don't have to come.

NICK	Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
ICH	No.
NICK	Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.

NICK	Start it.
ICH	I can't...

NICK	Just one, compadre... Kampai.
ICH	Kampai.

NICK	You did great, Ichiro.
ICH	I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.

NICK	I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
ICH	I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
NICK	How many men?
ICH	I couldn't tell.
NICK	Joyce?
ICH	I don't know.
NICK	We need the plate to negotiate with.

ICH	Someone attacked him.
NICK	Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.

ICH	Thank you.  You have one?
NICK	A wife.  She left.
ICH	I'm sorry.
NICK	Me too.

NICK	What's that for?
ICH	Luck.

ICH	You know, Nick, we can't lose.
NICK	Why's that?
ICH	Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.

NICK	You all right?
ICH	Yes...
NICK	Call for help.

ICH	Louder, pal, louder.
NICK	Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?

ICH	Think we'll get him, Nick?
NICK	We can't lose.
ICH	How can you be so sure?

NICK	Don't give him any more.
JOYCE	He gets as much as he wants.

JOYCE	Ich said you left.
NICK	There was a change in plans.

JOYCE	Dead gaiijin's are big news.
NICK	Gaiijin?
JOYCE	An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
NICK	I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
JOYCE	I don't give tours.

NICK	You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
JOYCE	You have a helluva way of asking for help.
NICK	You have a helluva way of answering.

JOYCE	Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
NICK	Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
JOYCE	I don't think so.

JOYCE	She ever pull down her shades?
NICK	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

JOYCE	Don't be an ass.
NICK	He's on duty.
JOYCE	I paid for that.

NICK	You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
JOYCE	Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.

NICK	I need your help, Joyce.
JOYCE	Where's Ich?
NICK	Unavailable.

JOYCE	I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
NICK	I need someone to translate for me.
JOYCE	My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
NICK	It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
JOYCE	And I'm supposed to care?
NICK	You could fake it.

JOYCE	You're wrong to sell Ich short.
NICK	He drinks.
JOYCE	He's got a reason.

NICK	Where's the wife?
JOYCE	You met her.

JOYCE	I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
NICK	What do you chant?
JOYCE	'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
NICK	Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
JOYCE	I don't remember saying yes.
NICK	I don't remember you saying no.

JOYCE	They want your autograph.
NICK	Who am I supposed to be?
JOYCE	This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
NICK	Tell them I'm not.

NICK	We're in?
JOYCE	The cheese...

JOYCE	You'll get Ich killed.
NICK	No one's keeping him here.
JOYCE	Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
NICK	Why would you care?

JOYCE	I still think you're a bastard.
NICK	What if I chant?
JOYCE	Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.

NICK	Can't make you change your mind?
JOYCE	Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
NICK	Might be different in New York.
JOYCE	Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
NICK	I'd like that.

KOBO	Keep the change.
NICK	I'm taking you back.

KOBO	Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
NICK	Save it, I already took the tour.
KOBO	You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.

KOBO	I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
NICK	Guess I'm on a roll.
KOBO	She's such a long way home for you.
NICK	Time, I've got plenty of.

KOBO	This is my stop.
NICK	I'm amused.
KOBO	Don't be.

NICK	Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
KOBO	Then take it from him.

OLIVER	How big a package we talking about?
NICK	This by this...
OLIVER	Dope?
NICK	Not in that company.
OLIVER	The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.

OLIVER	One guy do all the damage?
NICK	Yeah.
OLIVER	Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.

OLIVER	Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
NICK	Why?
OLIVER	He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
NICK	What?

OLIVER	You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
NICK	What...?  What if I say no?
OLIVER	Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
NICK	Why me?
OLIVER	They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.

OLIVER	It's not your job.
NICK	He was my partner.
OLIVER	They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
NICK	I planned on catching him, Captain.
OLIVER	How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
NICK	He killed a police officer.
OLIVER	Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.

OLIVER	... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
NICK	Right.

OHASHI	You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
NICK	Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.

NICK	I want a gun.
OHASHI	It is not allowed.
NICK	We're police officers.
OHASHI	You're foreigners.
NICK	Work with me.  I want your best detective.

NICK	Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
OHASHI	Do you know what this is?

NICK	Could you fill me in?
OHASHI	Why don't you ask your chief detective?

NICK	Because I want you to tell me.
OHASHI	The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
NICK	Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

NICK	What's this?
OHASHI	Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
NICK	While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
OHASHI	Look.

NICK	Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
OHASHI	Twenty-four hours, detective.

OHASHI	Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
NICK	For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
OHASHI	You had my help, detective.
NICK	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
OHASHI	-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
NICK	I have to get to Sugai.
OHASHI	Goodbye, officer.

SUGAI	Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
NICK	I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
SUGAI	-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.

SUGAI	I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
NICK	I want him.
SUGAI	He'll be dealt with.

SUGAI	Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
NICK	The families who control the casinos?
SUGAI	Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.

SUGAI	Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
NICK	The Feds would be onto you in a month.
SUGAI	Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?

NICK	Why tell me this?
SUGAI	The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
NICK	You trust me?
SUGAI	I'll pay you.

NICK	With these?
SUGAI	Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
NICK	If I say no?
SUGAI	You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
NICK	I don't have to.

NICK	Good.
SUGAI	He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.

NICK	That wasn't our deal.
SUGAI	You want him dead too.
NICK	After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.

TRAMPY	It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
ADULTERER	Spare me.
TRAMPY	I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.

ADULTERER	Stop!
TRAMPY	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
ADULTERER	They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!

TRAMPY	YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
ADULTERER	They'll get in! We'll all die!

ADULTERER	You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
HEROINE	We can't risk letting them in.
ADULTERER	Right.

HEROINE	Careful.
ADULTERER	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

ADULTERER	I will not die because of him!
HEROINE	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!

ADULTERER	We should go! We should go right now!
HEROINE	He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.

ADULTERER	Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
HEROINE	They'll be back.
ADULTERER	Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!

HEROINE	You know where it is?
ADULTERER	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

HEROINE	We'll meet in three hours?
ADULTERER	I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...

ADULTERER	Where are you two going?
HEROINE	We're going to get my little girl.

ADULTERER	Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
HEROINE	Where is everyone?
ADULTERER	I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?

BOSS MAN	IS IT CLEAR?!
BARTENDER	Yeah.
BOSS MAN	IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
BARTENDER	Nah, I got the gun.

BOSS MAN	My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
BARTENDER	Her fella.

BARTENDER	Well, it don't look pretty.
BOSS MAN	But it's got teeth.

BOSS MAN	I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
BARTENDER	I got shells too, box and a half, tops.

BARTENDER	I don't think you should...
BOSS MAN	With what just happened upstairs --

BEER GUY	One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
BARTENDER	Gonna stay for a couple?

BEER GUY	I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
BARTENDER	Who the hell would you call?
BEER GUY	Anyone.

BEER GUY	Stop it.
BARTENDER	Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?

BARTENDER	We shot a skunk.
BEER GUY	We're lucky to be alive.

BARTENDER	Hey! Get quiet or get out.
BOZO	C'mon guys--

BARTENDER	I think I know where a CB is.
BOZO	Where's that?
BARTENDER	Upstairs.

BOZO	Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
BARTENDER	Come on, come on.

BARTENDER	Oh!
BOZO	OH!? WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?

BARTENDER	Wha?
BOZO	OPEN THE DOOR!

BARTENDER	You got something better?
BOZO	If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.

BOZO	We'll be food, dickheads!
BARTENDER	Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
BOZO	You gotta be with me on this.

HEROINE	That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
BARTENDER	And the rest of 'em?
HEROINE	Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.

HEROINE	And that's how I ended up here.
BARTENDER	And the head?

BARTENDER	So, your husband ditched you?
HEROINE	No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
BARTENDER	Well, justice is funny.

BARTENDER	They're right here.
HEROINE	Hey!

BARTENDER	Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
HEROINE	Easy.

HEROINE	Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
BARTENDER	There's a tunnel.

HEROINE	What tunnel? Where?
BARTENDER	It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
HEROINE	What's it for?

HEROINE	HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
BARTENDER	What!? I'm not going down there again!
HEROINE	This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
BARTENDER	This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.

BARTENDER	You all sure about this?
HEROINE	Follow me.

HEROINE	Where's the tunnel?
BARTENDER	In the corner, behind the curtain.

HEROINE	We just smeared a skunk.
BARTENDER	Shit!

BARTENDER	I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
HEROINE	Just move!

BARTENDER	You seem mighty collected about this.
HEROINE	Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.

BARTENDER	You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
ROADIE	Fuck you too.
BARTENDER	Get in line!

ROADIE	Scared?
BARTENDER	No. You?
ROADIE	Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.

BARTENDER	I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
ROADIE	The door... on three.

ROADIE	Ohhh.
BARTENDER	What?
ROADIE	Look.

ROADIE	That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
BARTENDER	Just an observation.
ROADIE	Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?

BEER GUY	So, what now? Did those things leave?
BOZO	Why don't you go check it out?
BEER GUY	Fuck no.

BOZO	Any more ideas Animal Planet?
BEER GUY	You weren't helpin'.
BOZO	Go douche.

BOZO	I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
BEER GUY	Oh yeah?

BOZO	Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
BEER GUY	Well then I guess we should just give up.
BOZO	Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.

BEER GUY	We're better off.
BOZO	Who's with me?

BEER GUY	Come on!
BOZO	He's dead.

BOZO	What now, Geronimo?
BEER GUY	My truck.

BEER GUY	Why do you take shit from him?
PARA	Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
BEER GUY	Your brother, huh?
PARA	Yep.
BEER GUY	Your parents of relation?
PARA	We lived near power lines.

BEER GUY	I'm in.
HEROINE	Anyone else?

HEROINE	We're going to get help.
BEER GUY	We gotta try.
HEROINE	Anybody else?

BEER GUY	We gotta be close.
HEROINE	What?

HEROINE	All right!  Tell us about the truck!
BEER GUY	Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.

BEER GUY	My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
HEROINE	What's in the back?
BEER GUY	Nothing, this was my last delivery.

BEER GUY	Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
HEROINE	But not flush against the tunnel?

HEROINE	It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
BEER GUY	Just cover me. It was built to move.

BELLE	How are you holding up?
BOSS MAN	Well...

BOSS MAN	Push and twist, it's child proof.
BELLE	Oh.
BOSS MAN	Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.

BELLE	What is this?
BOSS MAN	Magic potion.  You should try a little.
BELLE	Oh, no.
BOSS MAN	It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
BELLE	Really?
BOSS MAN	Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
BELLE	Will I go crazy or something?
BOSS MAN	No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
BELLE	Why not then?

BOSS MAN	Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
BELLE	But --
BOSS MAN	It's much safer in there, sweety.
BELLE	Okay then.

BELLE	Doesn't your foot hurt?
BOSS MAN	I can't feel a thing, Hon.

BELLE	Um-hmmm.
BOSS MAN	The girl's got rhythm.

BELLE	You wanna see, baby?
BOSS MAN	Sure.
BELLE	How much you got?
BOSS MAN	How much I got, what?

BELLE	How much you got to see the show?
BOSS MAN	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

BELLE	What? Really?
BOSS MAN	Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

HEROINE	My husband...
BOSS MAN	Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
HEROINE	He's dead.
BOSS MAN	What?

BOSS MAN	Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
HEROINE	Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
BOSS MAN	So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
HEROINE	He only shot you once.
BOSS MAN	Huh?
HEROINE	He shot you the other time.

HEROINE	Will these boards hold?
BOSS MAN	The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
HEROINE	Good.

BOSS MAN	In the kitchen, under the sink.
HEROINE	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.

BOSS MAN	Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
HEROINE	You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.

HEROINE	What?
BOSS MAN	What?
HEROINE	What do you mean what?
BOSS MAN	Huh?
HEROINE	What's going on between you two?
BOSS MAN	Nothing.

HEROINE	What's it for!?
BOSS MAN	Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
HEROINE	Is it gassed up?
BOSS MAN	Fully.
HEROINE	Four door?
BOSS MAN	Two.
HEROINE	Open?
BOSS MAN	Covered.
HEROINE	How many?
BOSS MAN	Holds four.
HEROINE	Max?
BOSS MAN	Seven.
HEROINE	Nine?
BOSS MAN	Seven.
HEROINE	Keys.
BOSS MAN	What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
HEROINE	Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
BOSS MAN	I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.

BOZO	What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
GRANDPA	Get outta here.

GRANDPA	This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
BOZO	Whoa!

GRANDPA	You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
BOZO	Oh? And what's that?
GRANDPA	Sit still, look less like a meal.
BOZO	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.

GRANDPA	I wouldn't do that, son.
BOZO	They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.

GRANDPA	I'll go with ya.
BOZO	What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

BOZO	Welcome back.
ROADIE	F-f-fuck you.

ROADIE	They were all over the place.
BOZO	You smell like ass!

ROADIE	Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
BOZO	Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?

ROADIE	Bullshit.
BOZO	No bullshit.

ROADIE	Clever fuckers.
BOZO	What the hell's going on here!?

BOZO	Blow the goddamn hatch!
ROADIE	Clear!

BOZO	Got 'cha!
HEROINE	HOLD THAT TIGHT!

HEROINE	'Eh, Chief?
BOZO	Duh hickey.

HEROINE	Fine, Chief.
BOZO	Gimme the keys.
HEROINE	NO, but I will lock you in.
BOZO	What?
HEROINE	We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.

HEROINE	You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
BOZO	Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
HEROINE	Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?

BOZO	What?!
HEROINE	Move slow and move quiet.
BOZO	No shit.

HEROINE	Move it!
BOZO	You keep that key handy.

HEROINE	Shit!
BOZO	I'm fine! I'm fine!

BOZO	JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
HEROINE	If he doesn't shut up...

HEROINE	Hurry!
BOZO	REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!

BOZO	SHIT.
HEROINE	MOVE YOUR ASS!

HEROINE	COME ON!
BOZO	HELLLLLLLLP!!

BOZO	Yeah, maybe.
HEROINE	Get something on that.

BOZO	Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
HEROINE	There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?

BOZO	You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
PARA	You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
BOZO	I'm sure.

PARA	HELP MEEE!
BOZO	BONSAI!

PARA	I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
BOZO	Amazing you made it this far.

BOZO	Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
PARA	Am I too heavy for you?
BOZO	Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.

BOZO	OH JESUS!
PARA	HELLLPPP!

GOLDIE	Well, maybe they migrate?
HEROINE	As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.

GOLDIE	Hey!
HEROINE	Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?

GOLDIE	Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
HEROINE	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?

GOLDIE	Yeah, I'll go.
HEROINE	Ok. Let's see what happens.

HEROINE	Let's move.
GOLDIE	I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.

GOOD GUY	Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
HEROINE	Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?

GOOD GUY	What's wrong?
HEROINE	Nothing, just lookin'.

HEROINE	Let's go.
GOOD GUY	She's not very nice, is she?

GOOD GUY	DON'T!
HEROINE	YOU'LL HIT US!

GOOD GUY	Let's wait it out.
HEROINE	They'll tear this place down within the hour.

HEROINE	If you are face to face with her, dive left.
ROADIE	And the last one is the...
HEROINE	Father. The biggest, the strongest...

HEROINE	Okay, well that's something.
ROADIE	So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.

ROADIE	There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
HEROINE	That's fine.

HEROINE	Hold it!
ROADIE	Whoa!

ROADIE	Let's go!
HEROINE	Wait God-dammit!

ROADIE	If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
HEROINE	Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?

HEROINE	Go! Go!
ROADIE	Not without you!!!
HEROINE	Go!!!

HEROINE	Get to your cars!
ROADIE	GO-GO-GO!!

TUFFY	Oh my God... What is that?
HEROINE	That's one piece of four problems.

TUFFY	Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
HEROINE	Stop her!

TUFFY	Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
HEROINE	Let's lock off this room.

TUFFY	Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
HEROINE	All right.

HEROINE	You know you don't have to do this.
TUFFY	I'm fine, I really am.
HEROINE	I admire your strength.
TUFFY	We all have to be strong, right?
HEROINE	Right.

HEROINE	Her name is Charlie.
TUFFY	Oh...
HEROINE	She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
TUFFY	I'll do anything to help.
HEROINE	I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
TUFFY	Deal.

HEROINE	We should stick together out there.
TUFFY	I'd love to.

TUFFY	Did we make it?
HEROINE	I think --

TROOP LEADER	Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

TROOP LEADER	Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, well...
TROOP LEADER	Are you lying to me?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Well...
TROOP LEADER	What did we say about lying?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I'm not lying.
TROOP LEADER	You know that no one likes a liar, right?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I said I'm not lying.

TROOP LEADER	What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I just hit it like you said.

BORDER GUARD	How many with you?
JACOB	Just my son and I.
BORDER GUARD	What is your purpose in Mexico?
JACOB	Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.

BORDER GUARD	What was that?
JACOB	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
BORDER GUARD	You said it was just you and your son.
JACOB	I meant me, my son and my daughter.
BORDER GUARD	Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

CARLOS	Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
SETH	Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
CARLOS	I don't know, one place's as good as another.
SETH	Have you ever been there before?
CARLOS	No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
SETH	Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.

CARLOS	I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
SETH	Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.

CARLOS	Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
SETH	You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
CARLOS	Twenty-eight.
SETH	Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.

CARLOS	You like the car?
SETH	I said new, this is an '90.
CARLOS	It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
SETH	So do I just follow you?
CARLOS	Yeah, follow us.
SETH	So let's do it.
CARLOS	Vamanos!

JACOB	We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
SCOTT	Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?

JACOB	Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
SCOTT	The truth hurts.

SCOTT	Why do you want to stop?
JACOB	I'm exhausted.
SCOTT	Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.

SCOTT	What's this guy's problem?
JACOB	I have no idea.

SCOTT	What are you gonna do?
JACOB	I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
SCOTT	No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.

JACOB	Have you forgotten about your sister?
SCOTT	They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
JACOB	If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
SCOTT	Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
JACOB	What about Kate?
SCOTT	They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
JACOB	Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
SCOTT	If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.

JACOB	Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
SCOTT	He's running the show.
JACOB	I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.

SCOTT	You don't believe in suicide.
JACOB	It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
SCOTT	Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
JACOB	Thank you, son.

SCOTT	Why did they block the door again?
JACOB	To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!

SETH	What's your name?
JACOB	Jacob.
SETH	Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.

SETH	What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
JACOB	He's my son.
SETH	How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
JACOB	Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
SETH	Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
JACOB	What's this about, money?
SETH	It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.

JACOB	It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
SETH	Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

SETH	Where are the keys to the motor home?
JACOB	On the dresser.
SETH	Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.

JACOB	Not a chance.
SETH	Come again?
JACOB	If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
SETH	Sorry, I need everybody.
JACOB	My children are not going with you, and that's that.
SETH	That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.

JACOB	Yes.
SETH	Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.

SETH	Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
JACOB	Scott and Kate.

SETH	Who's this?
JACOB	My wife.
SETH	Where is the little lady?
JACOB	In heaven.
SETH	She's dead?
JACOB	Yes, she is.
SETH	How'd she die?
JACOB	Auto wreck.
SETH	Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
JACOB	No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
SETH	Died instantly?
JACOB	Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
SETH	Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
JACOB	Yes, they do.

SETH	Is this real?
JACOB	Yes.
SETH	I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
JACOB	Real McCoy.
SETH	You're a preacher?
JACOB	I was a minister.
SETH	Was? As in not anymore?
JACOB	Yes.
SETH	Why'd ya quit?
JACOB	I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
SETH	I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
JACOB	Yes.
SETH	I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
JACOB	How do I know you'll keep your word?
SETH	Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
JACOB	You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
SETH	Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
JACOB	Yes.
SETH	Didn't like it, did ya?
JACOB	No, I didn't.
SETH	Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
JACOB	You won't let him touch her?
SETH	I can handle Richie, don't worry.

JACOB	If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
SETH	Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!

SETH	Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
JACOB	I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
SETH	You best better get it done, Pops.

JACOB	I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
SETH	As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
JACOB	I don't have the slightest idea.
SETH	Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.

JACOB	We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
SETH	Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.

JACOB	Then?
SETH	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.

JACOB	Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
SETH	Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

SETH	Who else?
JACOB	Pass.
SETH	Why not, against your religion?
JACOB	No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
SETH	Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?

JACOB	Why are you so agitated?
SETH	I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
JACOB	He backed down.
SETH	He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
JACOB	What are you going to do?
SETH	I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
JACOB	Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
SETH	I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
JACOB	Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?

SETH	What did you call me?
JACOB	Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.

SETH	To your family.
JACOB	To yours.

JACOB	Now, is your shit together?
SETH	Forever together.

JACOB	Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
SETH	Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.

SETH	You too, preacher?
JACOB	I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
SETH	Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
JACOB	In the Winnebago.
SETH	In other words, no.

SETH	I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
JACOB	What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
SETH	Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?

SETH	Did he...?
JACOB	Yep.

SETH	You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
JACOB	You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.

JACOB	What's this stuff?
SETH	My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
JACOB	Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
SETH	I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
JACOB	Amen.

SETH	I promise.
JACOB	Kate, Scott?

KATE	It's the bitterest of pills.
JACOB	You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
KATE	Ain't it the truth.

JACOB	I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
KATE	Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.

KATE	Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
JACOB	That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
KATE	I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
JACOB	Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
KATE	It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
JACOB	I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
KATE	That happens, you'll get it back.
JACOB	Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
KATE	What do you think Mom would say?
JACOB	Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

JACOB	There's nothing wrong with this place.
KATE	It's a flop house.
JACOB	It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
KATE	If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.

JACOB	It has a bed. That's all I care about.
KATE	Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...

JACOB	About two hours from now.
KATE	So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.

KATE	You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
JACOB	No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.

KATE	I promise.
JACOB	Scott?

JACOB	Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
KATE	Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
JACOB	Not good enough, swear to God.
KATE	I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
JACOB	Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...

KATE	I'm going for 'em!
JACOB	No!
KATE	Everybody goes home!

KATE	What's going on?
RICHARD	We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

KATE	Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
RICHARD	Sure.

RICHARD	What?
KATE	Where are you taking us?
RICHARD	Mexico.
KATE	What's in Mexico?
RICHARD	Mexicans.

KATE	What?
RICHARD	In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
KATE	Do what?
RICHARD	What you said to me in the room.
KATE	What did I say?
RICHARD	You asked me if I would --

KATE	Creepy guy.
SETH	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.

SETH	You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
KATE	Yes.
SETH	Do you believe me?
KATE	Yes.
SETH	You damn well better. Go.

KATE	Yeah.
SETH	You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
KATE	Yeah, we got a bible.
SETH	Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?

KATE	You're gonna let us go?
SETH	In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.

SETH	How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
KATE	Okay.

KATE	Are you okay?
SETH	Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
KATE	I'm really sorry.
SETH	Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!

KATE	We have to go back for Daddy!
SETH	Daddy's dead.
KATE	Noooo!

KATE	Watch my back!
SETH	Anytime.

SETH	How many bullets left, kid?
KATE	Not many.
SETH	Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.

KATE	Should I use the last bullets on us?
SETH	You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.

SETH	I'm sorry.
KATE	Me too.

SETH	See ya.
KATE	Later.

SCOTT	Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
KATE	-- you got your microwave --
SCOTT	-- you got your sink --
KATE	-- you got your shower --
SCOTT	-- see this, television!
KATE	Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

STANLEY CHASE	For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
KELLY HOUGE	Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
STANLEY CHASE	Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
KELLY HOUGE	Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
STANLEY CHASE	We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
KELLY HOUGE	What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
STANLEY CHASE	This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
KELLY HOUGE	Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
STANLEY CHASE	I would say that's a very safe assumption.

MCGRAW	Hot goddamn day!
PETE	Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
MCGRAW	Not even for lunch?
PETE	I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

MCGRAW	Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
PETE	Whatsamatter?
MCGRAW	Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
PETE	Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
MCGRAW	Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
PETE	You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
MCGRAW	What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
PETE	That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
MCGRAW	Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.

MCGRAW	They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
PETE	Knock yourself out.

MCGRAW	Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
PETE	Six-fifty.

PETE	What do you want from me? I did what you said.
SETH	Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
PETE	He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
SETH	I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."

SETH	Were you giving that pig signals?
PETE	What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

SETH	He says you were scratching.
PETE	I wasn't scratching!
SETH	You callin' him a liar?

PETE	I never said help us!
SETH	Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!

SETH	Whiskey!
RAZOR CHARLIE	You can't come in here.
SETH	What dya mean?
RAZOR CHARLIE	This is a private club. You're not welcome.
SETH	Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
RAZOR CHARLIE	This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!

RAZOR CHARLIE	Best in Mexico.
SETH	I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.

SETH	What the fuck was that about?
RICHARD	He signaled the Ranger.

SETH	What the fuck is wrong with you --
RICHARD	Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:

SETH	Start the car.
RICHARD	You believe me don't cha?
SETH	Shut up and start the car.

SETH	Richie? You okay?
RICHARD	I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"

RICHARD	Yeah?
SETH	When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
RICHARD	Gotcha!
SETH	One... Two... Three.

SETH	What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
RICHARD	What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
SETH	He didn't recognize shit.

RICHARD	Do they have cable?
SETH	No.
RICHARD	Do they have an X-rated channel?
SETH	No.
RICHARD	Do they have a waterbed?
SETH	They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.

SETH	How's it feel?
RICHARD	How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.

SETH	I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
RICHARD	Feels good.
SETH	I'm gonna go get the money.

RICHARD	Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
SETH	That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
RICHARD	Did you even to try to negotiate?
SETH	These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
RICHARD	All I'm saying --
SETH	-- This conversation is over.

RICHARD	Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
SETH	Sight seein'.
RICHARD	What'd ya see?
SETH	Cops.
RICHARD	Didya look at the border?

SETH	Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
RICHARD	They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.

SETH	I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
RICHARD	Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
SETH	Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
RICHARD	How do you know?
SETH	I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --

SETH	Where's the woman?
RICHARD	What?

SETH	What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
RICHARD	She's in the other room.
SETH	What the fuck is she doin' there?!

SETH	Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
RICHARD	There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
SETH	No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
RICHARD	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
SETH	Is it me? Is it my fault?
RICHARD	It's not your fault, it's her fault!

SETH	Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
RICHARD	What?
SETH	This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
RICHARD	Seth, if you were me --
SETH	Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
RICHARD	Yes.
SETH	Yes, Seth, I understand.
RICHARD	Yes, Seth, I understand.

SETH	Richard!
RICHARD	What?

RICHARD	This isn't gonna work.
SETH	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
RICHARD	I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
SETH	Duly noted. Now, shut up.

RICHARD	They're gonna search the van.
SETH	As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
RICHARD	What does that mean?
SETH	What?

RICHARD	You just called me a fuckin' nut.
SETH	No, I didn't.
RICHARD	Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
SETH	Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
RICHARD	You meant that, but you meant the other, too.

SETH	This ain't the time, Richard.
RICHARD	Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
SETH	Keep your voice down.
RICHARD	Or what?

RICHARD	I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
SETH	This ain't the time.
RICHARD	Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.

SETH	You okay?
RICHARD	Yeah, I think so. What happened?
SETH	I don't know, you just passed out.
RICHARD	I did?
SETH	Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
RICHARD	Really?
SETH	Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
RICHARD	Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
SETH	Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
RICHARD	What?
SETH	We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
RICHARD	We are?
SETH	Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?

RICHARD	Far out.  Where are my glasses?
SETH	They broke when you fell.
RICHARD	Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
SETH	Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
RICHARD	What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
SETH	When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
RICHARD	Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
SETH	It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.

RICHARD	That's what you think?
SETH	That's how you're lookin', Richie.
RICHARD	I'm lookin' scared?
SETH	That's what you look like.
RICHARD	You know what you look like?
SETH	No, Richie, what do I look like?
RICHARD	You're lookin' green.

SETH	How?
RICHARD	Where are you right now?
SETH	What do you mean?
RICHARD	Where are you?
SETH	I'm here with you.
RICHARD	No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
SETH	My shit is together.
RICHARD	It don't look together.
SETH	Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.

SETH	Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
RICHARD	Yeah.
SETH	Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
RICHARD	Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?

RICHARD	How are you?
SETH	Scarred for life, that's how I am!

SETH	How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
SCOTT	Okay, I'll have one.

SETH	In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
SCOTT	Yeah, it's mine.
SETH	Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

SCOTT	You could take their head off.
SETH	Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.

SCOTT	He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
SETH	He needs our help!
SCOTT	He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.

QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
ALEXANDER	Well good, that's very... nice.
QUELLEK	By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
ALEXANDER	Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
QUELLEK	I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
ALEXANDER	Just don't.
QUELLEK	...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.

ALEXANDER	This is it?
QUELLEK	Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
ALEXANDER	Where's my bed?

QUELLEK	Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
ALEXANDER	Is that the bathroom?
QUELLEK	Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.

QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
ALEXANDER	Thanks.
QUELLEK	Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
ALEXANDER	Uh uh! What did we talk about?
QUELLEK	Right... Sorry, sir.

QUELLEK	Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
ALEXANDER	Quellek. What are you doing in there?
QUELLEK	I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
ALEXANDER	Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

QUELLEK	Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
ALEXANDER	Open.

ALEXANDER	Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
QUELLEK	I'm... I'm shot.

ALEXANDER	Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
QUELLEK	I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
ALEXANDER	No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
QUELLEK	... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...

ALEXANDER	Don't speak, Quellek.
QUELLEK	You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.

JASON	Come on, old friend...
ALEXANDER	Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..

JASON	You WILL go out there.
ALEXANDER	I won't and nothing you say-
JASON	The show must go on.
ALEXANDER	...Damn you!  Damn you!

JASON	I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
ALEXANDER	... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
JASON	Leadership....

ALEXANDER	God, what an ass.
JASON	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...

JASON	Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
ALEXANDER	Just!?

JASON	At ease men.
ALEXANDER	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

ALEXANDER	We've got to stop!
JASON	We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
ALEXANDER	You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
JASON	Like YOU know?

JASON	NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
ALEXANDER	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
JASON	KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!

ALEXANDER	About this much.
JASON	What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
ALEXANDER	THIS much.

JASON	There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
ALEXANDER	Must be some sort of mining facility.

ALEXANDER	Go ahead!
JASON	You go first! There's no time!
ALEXANDER	Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-

JASON	What?  What?
ALEXANDER	Nothing.
JASON	I heard something. A squeal.

ALEXANDER	Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
JASON	KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...

JASON	ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
ALEXANDER	... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
JASON	It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
ALEXANDER	That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
JASON	Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?

ALEXANDER	Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
JASON	Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,

ALEXANDER	Purple skinned monstrosity...?
JASON	I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
ALEXANDER	Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
JASON	I had the shot...

JASON	~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
ALEXANDER	Yes. Good was done this .....
JASON	Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-

ALEXANDER	Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
JASON	No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-

ALEXANDER	He's a twit!
TOMMY	Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?

TOMMY	Not again...
ALEXANDER	I played Richard III...

TOMMY	Settle down, Alex...
ALEXANDER	No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!

TOMMY	What the hell is going on?!!?
ALEXANDER	Jason, what have you gotten us into?

ALEXANDER	He wants to THINK!?
TOMMY	No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!

ALEXANDER	Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
TOMMY	They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...

ALEXANDER	What's happened?
TOMMY	The engines are dead. We're drifting.

TOMMY	You were holding it upside down weren't you?
ALEXANDER	Shut up.
TOMMY	You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
ALEXANDER	You think you could do better "Laredo?"
TOMMY	Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.

ALEXANDER	And note the sucked in gut.
TOMMY	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...

ALEXANDER	This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
TOMMY	You have a better plan, Alex?
ALEXANDER	As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'

















ALEXANDER	Go into the cloud! ...
L229288	u1041	m68	GWEN	FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
L229287	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
L229279	u1041	m68	GWEN	The ships are gaining...
L229278	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	May I get the check?
L229267	u1041	m68	GWEN	Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
L229266	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We heard it the first time!
L229085	u1041	m68	GWEN	All this from watching the.. historical records?
L229084	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh my god, It's real.
L228979	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
L228978	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
L228977	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	A boy comes to the door.
L228976	u1041	m68	GWEN	You could order something in.
L228975	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
L228974	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why didn't you stop at the market?
L228973	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
L228897	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh can't I? Watch me!
L228896	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex you can't -just leave.
L228871	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
L228870	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
L228865	u1041	m68	GWEN	The guy is terminally selfish!
L228864	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a miserable twit!
L229659	u1037	m68	BRANDON	We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
L229658	u1043	m68	KYLE	I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
L229657	u1037	m68	BRANDON	You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
L229656	u1043	m68	KYLE	Oh.  Okay.
L229655	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
L229654	u1043	m68	KYLE	Hi Brandon.
L229036	u1037	m68	BRANDON	He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
L229035	u1043	m68	KYLE	He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
L229765	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
L229764	u1042	m68	JASON	That's It?
L229763	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Raise the glass and push the blue button.
L229762	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
L229730	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
L229729	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  Up?
L229728	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Up.
L229727	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Go. They're off again.
L229725	u1037	m68	BRANDON	GO Commander.
L229724	u1042	m68	JASON	Shit! Go!
L229723	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Lt. Madison, GO.
L229722	u1042	m68	JASON	No, wait, are you-
L229721	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Wait two seconds then go.
L229720	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, now. But-
L229719	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
L229707	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
L229706	u1042	m68	JASON	BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
L229700	u1037	m68	BRANDON	My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
L229699	u1042	m68	JASON	How did you come to that conclusion?
L229698	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
L229697	u1042	m68	JASON	But you don't?
L229696	u1037	m68	BRANDON	It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
L229695	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you mean?
L229694	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
L229693	u1042	m68	JASON	What does the Omega 13 do?
L229692	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander?
L229691	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
L229670	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, that's where you want to be.
L229669	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes...?
L229668	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
GWEN	Alex? Where are you going?
ALEXANDER	To see if there's a pub.

GWEN	Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
ALEXANDER	Could they be the miners?

GWEN	I don't know.
ALEXANDER	Nobody was WATCHING?

GWEN	Those blue things ate everybody here?
ALEXANDER	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...

ALEXANDER	He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
GWEN	Down there.

ALEXANDER	You said "the Commander.
GWEN	What?
ALEXANDER	Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
GWEN	No I didn't.
ALEXANDER	Yes you did.

GWEN	He always has to make the big entrance.





BRANDON	Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
JASON	Excuse me guys.

BRANDON	Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
JASON	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
BRANDON	Yes but, we were wondering-
JASON	There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?

BRANDON	... Yes?
JASON	We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
BRANDON	Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
JASON	What's  your name, son?
BRANDON	Brandon.
JASON	Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
BRANDON	Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
JASON	It's okay. Listen-
BRANDON	... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
JASON	It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
BRANDON	I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
JASON	Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.

JASON	Okay, we got it.
BRANDON	Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.

BRANDON	Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
JASON	Okay...  Okay, now what.
BRANDON	Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.

BRANDON	Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
JASON	We'd never have the budget for this.















COMPUTER	Structural damage at 68 percent.
GWEN	We're getting major structural damage.

GWEN	I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
COMPUTER	Yes?
GWEN	What's the weather like outside?
COMPUTER	There is no weather in space.
GWEN	I never get tired of that joke.

COMPUTER	The ship is sustaining structural damage.
GWEN	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...

COMPUTER	The enemy is matching velocity.
GWEN	The enemy is matching velocity.

GWEN	Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
COMPUTER	The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
GWEN	It's fractured...

COMPUTER	Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
GWEN	We need another one.

COMPUTER	Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
GWEN	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.

COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
GWEN	All systems are working, Commander.

COMPUTER	Systems register functional.

FRED	U.... What do you think?
NERVOUS TECH	That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
FRED	... What does that mean?
NERVOUS TECH	What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
FRED	Covalent... Right. So...
NERVOUS TECH	So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
FRED	OK!

FRED	Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
JASON	I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.

FRED	A hologram...
JASON	Never mind, Fred....
FRED	No, no... I'll think on it...

JASON	The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
FRED	Right.
JASON	I'll take my chances with Gorignak.

FRED	No, I'll kill you. .
JASON	Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..

JASON	Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
FRED	You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.

FRED	As good as Hopkins?
JASON	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.

GUY	How do you remember this stuff?
FRED	Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.

FRED	You Okay, Alex?
GUY	I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

FRED	...The digital conveyor.
GUY	Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!

FRED	We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
GUY	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
FRED	It's suicide.
GUY	I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
FRED	Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?

GUY	Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
GWEN	Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.

GUY	Crewman #6... Call me Guy.
GWEN	You... know us?

GWEN	THAT'S why you built this ship?
GUY	It's ... incredible.

GUY	The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
GWEN	The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.

GWEN	Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
GUY	Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?

GWEN	Where are the miners?
GUY	Something BAD happened here.

GWEN	Oh, they're so cute.
GUY	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...

GUY	I am SO SICK of being right.
GWEN	Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.

GWEN	How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
GUY	We're doing episode 31, Jason?

GUY	...Okay
JASON	All right. Put me back on with him.

GUY	They're still behind us...
JASON	We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...

JASON	Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
GUY	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
JASON	Your last name.
GUY	Yeah, what is it?
JASON	It's... I don't know.
GUY	No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?

GUY	We're screwed... We're so screwed...
JASON	All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.

GUY	That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
JASON	Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?

JASON	It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
GUY	Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
JASON	It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
GUY	BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!

GUY	I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
JASON	A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'

GUY	We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
JASON	No. Keep all energy to the armor.

GUY	Hi everybody.
TOMMY	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
GUY	Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"

GUY	More to the left... Stay parallel...
TOMMY	Hey, YOU want to drive?

TOMMY	Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.
GUY	We're doing episode 31?
TOMMY	Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.

TOMMY	They're gone.
GUY	Where'd they go? Back inside?

TOMMY	You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
GUY	Not a clue. You?
TOMMY	I think he just likes pointing at things.

GUY	We're alive!
TOMMY	We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.

GUY	~e're alive!
TOMMY	We made it. Commander, we made it.'

JASON	A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
GWEN	How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
JASON	What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.

GWEN	What?
JASON	You smiled at me.

JASON	This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
GWEN	You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...

JASON	It's Jason...
GWEN	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
JASON	Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-

JASON	Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
GWEN	Only answers to me.
JASON	But I'm the Commander!
GWEN	On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
JASON	C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.

GWEN	Wait. When are you going to tell them?
JASON	Tell them? About...
GWEN	Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
JASON	Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
GWEN	Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
JASON	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
GWEN	Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...

JASON	Hey... Hey where are you going?
GWEN	We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
JASON	Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!

GWEN	We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
JASON	Let me think. I need time to think.

GWEN	There's nobody here. Jason...
JASON	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.

JASON	All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
GWEN	Jason..
JASON	We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
GWEN	JASON...
JASON	You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?

JASON	I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
GWEN	I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
JASON	Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...

JASON	Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
GWEN	I don't think that's a cloud...

JASON	Are they behind us?
GWEN	No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.

JASON	Can it be repaired?
GWEN	Computer, can it be repaired?

JASON	Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
GWEN	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?

GWEN	Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
JASON	Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
GWEN	I could have held on to YOU! ...

GWEN	You're playing your good side.
JASON	Don't be ridiculous.

JASON	All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
GWEN	Why does this sound so familiar?

GWEN	How does the rolling help, actually?
JASON	It helps.

GWEN	Clenched jaw...
JASON	Will you stop RIDING ME?!

GWEN	Jason.. Can you hear me?
JASON	Yes. Yes, I'm here!

GWEN	Thank God. Are you okay?
JASON	Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
GWEN	Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.

JASON	What?  What did he say?
GWEN	Nothing. Hold please.

JASON	Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
GWEN	Turn on the translation circuit.

GWEN	Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
JASON	What the hell are you talking about?

GWEN	So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
JASON	Right.
GWEN	Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
JASON	No I don't. But I know somebody who does.

JASON	There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
GWEN	Wait... Jason, Here!...

GWEN	What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
JASON	Gwen...
GWEN	We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
JASON	Because it was on the show!
GWEN	Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!

GWEN	He's accelerating to Mark 6.
JASON	Mark 12.

GWEN	never doubted you for a second.
JASON	TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!

TOMMY	Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
GWEN	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.

GWEN	You're kidding. When for?
TOMMY	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.

GWEN	Unbelievable.
TOMMY	You are so full of shit

GWEN	You gotta admit, they do love him.
TOMMY	Almost as much as he loves himself.

TOMMY	That's it, It's go time.
GWEN	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.

TOMMY	You should have let me hit him.
GWEN	I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!

TOMMY	You know, that's really getting annoying.
GWEN	I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
TOMMY	Sure, no problem.

GWEN	Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
TOMMY	I can't...  It's on autopilot!...

GWEN	We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
TOMMY	That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
GWEN	Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"

TOMMY	I heard it too.
GWEN	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?

TOMMY	JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
TOMMY	Closer?  I can try.

GWEN	Tommy, look!  Those lights...

SARRIS	First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
JASON	Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.

JASON	Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
SARRIS	Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.

JASON	Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
SARRIS	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
JASON	Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
SARRIS	You have ten seconds.
JASON	All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.

JASON	Yes.
SARRIS	Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
JASON	I don't know.

SARRIS	Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
JASON	Stop, please! I don't know!
SARRIS	Prepare a tear harness for the female...
JASON	No! I swear I don't know! Please!
SARRIS	Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?

SARRIS	Wait. What did you say?
JASON	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.

SARRIS	Explain -
JASON	Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.

JASON	My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
SARRIS	Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
JASON	We pretend...
SARRIS	Simpler.
JASON	We.. We lie.
SARRIS	Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...

JASON	Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
SARRIS	This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.

MATHESAR	Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
JASON	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
MATHESAR	I... certainly, but-
JASON	Catch me later, okay?

MATHESAR	Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
JASON	Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.

MATHESAR	Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
JASON	Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
MATHESAR	As you wish.

MATHESAR	Commander?... Where are you... going?
JASON	Home.
MATHESAR	You... You mean Earth?
JASON	Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.

MATHESAR	But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
JASON	Right. Long live... What's your planet?
MATHESAR	Theramin.
JASON	Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
MATHESAR	But what if Sarris survives?
JASON	Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
MATHESAR	He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
JASON	I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...

MATHESAR	An interstellar vox.
JASON	Thanks

MATHESAR	How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
JASON	It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.

MATHESAR	Weapons storage...
JASON	It's perfectly safe. I promise.
MATHESAR	... Maintenance facility...

MATHESAR	To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
JASON	Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!

JASON	Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
MATHESAR	NO, Thank God he has not.
JASON	Then how did he find out about the device?
MATHESAR	Our former Commander was not... Strong.
JASON	Former Commander?
MATHESAR	I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.

MATHESAR	Commander...
JASON	Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.

JASON	Mathesar? What is that?
MATHESAR	It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.

MATHESAR	A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
JASON	You what?.. What are you talking about?
MATHESAR	We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...

MATHESAR	Deception... "Lies."
JASON	Well... Sort of...
MATHESAR	We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.

JASON	I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
MATHESAR	But there it is!...
JASON	A model, only as big as this.
MATHESAR	But... Inside, I have seen-
JASON	Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
MATHESAR	But...Why?
JASON	It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.

MATHESAR	The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
JASON	You can oc that?

TOMMY	You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
JASON	I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.

TOMMY	... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
JASON	And determination.

JASON	That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
TOMMY	Wh... Where are we?
JASON	Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.

TOMMY	What's going on?
JASON	I think we're going to exit the space port.

TOMMY	Excuse me?
JASON	They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...

JASON	Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
TOMMY	Why don't you just turn it on and see?

TOMMY	Where?
JASON	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!

JASON	Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
TOMMY	It's as far as it goes!

TOMMY	Could be this.
JASON	Push It. Hold it down.

JASON	Do your best, Tommy...
TOMMY	Oh god...

JASON	All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
TOMMY	What kind of signal?
JASON	Anything.
TOMMY	Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
JASON	Tommy, we have these...

TOMMY	Oh, right, sorry.
JASON	Okay, let's go.

TOMMY	Sorry Guys... It just went off.
JASON	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!

JASON	Okay... On what?
TOMMY	How about the pig-lizard?
JASON	Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.

TOMMY	Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
JASON	It doesn't have eyes.
TOMMY	The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
JASON	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!

TOMMY	NO NO NO.
JASON	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry

JASON	All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
TOMMY	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
JASON	Practice driving, Tommy.

JASON	Pedal to the metal Tommy...
TOMMY	Pedal to the metal...

JASON	Let's do it, Tommy.
TOMMY	Commander?... Call me Laredo?
JASON	Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.

JASON	Hold course, Laredo!
TOMMY	I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...

LATHE	Continue forward, sir?
SARRIS	Patience, Lt. . Patience.

SARRIS	Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
LATHE	The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.

SARRIS	Find them.
LATHE	But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
SARRIS	Find them.

LATHE	enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
SARRIS	Get oacK on their tail.

SARRIS	WHAT? WH
LATHE	Because they're coming right at us.
SARRIS	Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR

DANA	Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
JANOSZ	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
DANA	Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

JANOSZ	We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
DANA	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.

JANOSZ	Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
DANA	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
JANOSZ	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

DANA	Janosz?
JANOSZ	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

JANOSZ	Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
DANA	No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
JANOSZ	Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
DANA	Good night, Janosz.

JANOSZ	Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
DANA	Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.

DANA	What do you want with my baby?
JANOSZ	No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
DANA	If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
JANOSZ	I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
DANA	Everybody has a choice.
JANOSZ	Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
DANA	I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.

JANOSZ	Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
DANA	We don't have a relationship.
JANOSZ	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
DANA	I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
JANOSZ	Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
DANA	I'd rather not.

DANA	Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
SPENGLER	I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.

DANA	What are you working on, Egon?
SPENGLER	I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.

SPENGLER	We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
DANA	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
SPENGLER	Oh no.
DANA	Do you ever see him?
SPENGLER	Occasionally
DANA	How is he these days?
SPENGLER	Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
DANA	Does he ever mention me?
SPENGLER	No.  Not that I can recall.

DANA	This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
SPENGLER	Certainly.
DANA	Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
SPENGLER	I won't.
DANA	Thank you.

DANA	Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
FRANK	I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
DANA	You're also a human being, Frank.
FRANK	Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
DANA	Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.

FRANK	Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
FRANK	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
DANA	Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
FRANK	Didn't I do it?

DANA	No, you didn't, Frank.
FRANK	Okay, that's no problem.
DANA	That's exactly what you said last week.

DANA	Hello, Peter.
VENKMAN	You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
DANA	I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
VENKMAN	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.

VENKMAN	So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
DANA	He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
VENKMAN	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
DANA	You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
VENKMAN	Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
DANA	Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
VENKMAN	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.

DANA	What do you think?
VENKMAN	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
DANA	His name is Oscar.
VENKMAN	Oscar!  You poor kid!
DANA	Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
VENKMAN	Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.

DANA	I'll do it.
VENKMAN	I'll supervise.

VENKMAN	Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA	We definitely had a moment or two.

DANA	That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN	Okay, let's take a look.

DANA	I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
VENKMAN	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
DANA	Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
VENKMAN	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
DANA	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
VENKMAN	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
DANA	Good luck.
VENKMAN	Thanks.

VENKMAN	So this is what you do, huh?
DANA	Oh, hello, Peter.
VENKMAN	You're really good, you know.
DANA	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.

DANA	I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
VENKMAN	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.

DANA	He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
VENKMAN	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

VENKMAN	I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
DANA	Good-bye, Peter.
VENKMAN	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!

DANA	I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
VENKMAN	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
DANA	Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

VENKMAN	You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
DANA	I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
VENKMAN	Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
DANA	I don't know what to do anymore.
VENKMAN	I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.

VENKMAN	This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
DANA	Peter, what about the bathtub?
VENKMAN	We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
DANA	It was full of this awful pink ooze.
VENKMAN	Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.

VENKMAN	Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
DANA	Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.

VENKMAN	Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
DANA	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
VENKMAN	For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
DANA	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
VENKMAN	Or we could do that.
DANA	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
VENKMAN	I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!

VENKMAN	Are you all squeaky clean now?
DANA	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?

DANA	They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
VENKMAN	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
DANA	I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
VENKMAN	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
DANA	Does she know anything about babies?
VENKMAN	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
DANA	Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

VENKMAN	Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
DANA	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
VENKMAN	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.

VENKMAN	So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
DANA	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
VENKMAN	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
DANA	For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
VENKMAN	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
DANA	Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
VENKMAN	I'm not even good for me.
DANA	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
VENKMAN	Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
DANA	So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
VENKMAN	Let me jingle you right now.

DANA	Maybe I should call Janine.
VENKMAN	Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.

DANA	I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
VENKMAN	Finally came to your senses, huh?

DANA	That's not true.  It was 1620.
VENKMAN	Same difference.

DANA	That's a terrible thing to say.
VENKMAN	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.

DANA	Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
STANTZ	No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
DANA	Hi, Egon.

STANTZ	Is this the spot?
DANA	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.

STANTZ	I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
DANA	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.

STANTZ	Sorry!
DANA	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

ELAINE	According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
VENKMAN	Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
ELAINE	I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
VENKMAN	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
ELAINE	It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
VENKMAN	No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.

HARDEMEYER	Can I help you?
VENKMAN	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

HARDEMEYER	I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
VENKMAN	I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
HARDEMEYER	I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
VENKMAN	No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
HARDEMEYER	Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?

HARDEMEYER	That's quite a story.
VENKMAN	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.

HARDEMEYER	Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
VENKMAN	Now you're talking.

HARDEMEYER	Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
VENKMAN	Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.

LOUIS	What is it, honey?
JANINE	It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
LOUIS	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

JANINE	Who are you going to call?
LOUIS	Ghostbusters.

LOUIS	Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
JANINE	What are you doing up here?
LOUIS	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
JANINE	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
LOUIS	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

JANINE	Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
LOUIS	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
JANINE	That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.

JANINE	Well, good night, Louis.
LOUIS	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
JANINE	I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
LOUIS	Oh, sure, that sounds great.

JANINE	I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
LOUIS	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
JANINE	It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
LOUIS	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.

JANINE	You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
LOUIS	Okay.

JANINE	Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
LOUIS	Tonight?

LOUIS	Should we go?
JANINE	I don't think we should leave her alone.
LOUIS	You're right.  We should stay.

JANINE	I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
LOUIS	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
JANINE	You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

JANOSZ	Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
VENKMAN	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?

JANOSZ	It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
VENKMAN	Too bad for the Moldavians.

JANOSZ	We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
VENKMAN	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

VENKMAN	I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
JANOSZ	My pleasure.

JANOSZ	Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
VENKMAN	I know.
JANOSZ	Then why have you come?
VENKMAN	We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.

VENKMAN	You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
JANOSZ	The Upper West Side.

VENKMAN	This is the one that looked at Dana.
JANOSZ	It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
VENKMAN	I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.

JANOSZ	So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
VENKMAN	Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.

JANOSZ	You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
VENKMAN	Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
JANOSZ	Command me, lord.
VIGO	On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.

VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
JANOSZ	Yes, the scourge --
VIGO	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
JANOSZ	-- the sorrow --
VIGO	I command you.
JANOSZ	I await the word of Vigo.
VIGO	The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
JANOSZ	Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
VIGO	So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.

JUDGE	Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
VENKMAN	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

JUDGE	You've got to do something!
VENKMAN	Who are they?
JUDGE	They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
VENKMAN	Maybe they just want to appeal.

VENKMAN	These boys aren't playing around.
JUDGE	You've got to stop them.  Please!

JUDGE	The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
LOUIS	Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?

JUDGE	Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
LOUIS	Do I?

LOUIS	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
JUDGE	Yes.

LOUIS	Can I have some of your water?
JUDGE	Get on with it, counselor!
LOUIS	Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

JUDGE	That's it?  That's all you have to say?
LOUIS	Did I forget something?

LOUIS	Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
SHERMAN	I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
LOUIS	Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
SHERMAN	I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
LOUIS	Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
SHERMAN	Like what?
LOUIS	I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
SHERMAN	You were the one who got me in.
LOUIS	I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
SHERMAN	Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
LOUIS	I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
SHERMAN	Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.

LOUIS	This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
SHERMAN	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --

LOUIS	Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
SHERMAN	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
LOUIS	I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.

VENKMAN	Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
MILTON	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
VENKMAN	Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
MILTON	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN	This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
MILTON	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN	Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?

VENKMAN	Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
PROSECUTOR	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

PROSECUTOR	So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
VENKMAN	Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.

PROSECUTOR	I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
VENKMAN	I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
PROSECUTOR	So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
VENKMAN	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.

VENKMAN	Egon!
SPENGLER	Hello, Venkman.
VENKMAN	How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
SPENGLER	I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
VENKMAN	I don't even want to know where that is.

SPENGLER	I'd like to have a stool specimen
VENKMAN	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?

VENKMAN	What now, Brainiac?
SPENGLER	I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
VENKMAN	Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.

SPENGLER	That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN	I knew that.

SPENGLER	You were supposed to help me with this.
VENKMAN	You need the exercise.

SPENGLER	Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --
VENKMAN	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.

VENKMAN	That's it?  "I'll be back?"
SPENGLER	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

SPENGLER	You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
VENKMAN	Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?

VENKMAN	Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
SPENGLER	This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

SPENGLER	It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
VENKMAN	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.

VENKMAN	So far so good.
SPENGLER	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.

VENKMAN	Pretty impressive, huh?
SPENGLER	It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
VENKMAN	From where -- Neptune?
SPENGLER	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
VENKMAN	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

SPENGLER	Who was that?
STANTZ	Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
SPENGLER	This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
STANTZ	You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
SPENGLER	Good idea.

STANTZ	Nothing.  Not a trace.
SPENGLER	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

SPENGLER	The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
STANTZ	This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
SPENGLER	What's the reading?

STANTZ	Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
SPENGLER	His nickname is "The Hammer."

STANTZ	Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
SPENGLER	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.

SPENGLER	I'm Egon --
STANTZ	And we're the ...

SPENGLER	No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
STANTZ	This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."

SPENGLER	Six feet -- seven -- eight --
STANTZ	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
SPENGLER	Nine feet -- ten --

SPENGLER	If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
STANTZ	Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.

SPENGLER	It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
STANTZ	I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
SPENGLER	We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --

STANTZ	Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
SPENGLER	Something good --

SPENGLER	Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
STANTZ	Do it!  Just do it!

SPENGLER	We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
WINSTON	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?

SPENGLER	There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
WINSTON	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

WINSTON	Is the line sinking?
SPENGLER	No, the slime is rising.

WINSTON	Rivers of the stuff!
SPENGLER	And it's all flowing toward the museum.

SPENGLER	Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
WINSTON	There's something very familiar about this painting.

VENKMAN	Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
STANTZ	Oh, hiya, Pete.
VENKMAN	So, no goat hooves, huh?
STANTZ	I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
VENKMAN	Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
STANTZ	Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

VENKMAN	Great.  So what are you guys working on?
STANTZ	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
VENKMAN	Who?
STANTZ	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
VENKMAN	Oh, Ray --

VENKMAN	Who?  Who?  Who?
STANTZ	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
VENKMAN	Who, Ray?
STANTZ	Dana!  Dana Barrett!

VENKMAN	Well, Holmes, what do you think?
STANTZ	It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

VENKMAN	What's that?
STANTZ	Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.

VENKMAN	I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ	Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN	Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

VENKMAN	Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
STANTZ	Okay, let's heat 'em up!

STANTZ	I'm Ray --
VENKMAN	I'm Peter --

STANTZ	Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
VENKMAN	Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
STANTZ	I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

VENKMAN	You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
STANTZ	If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

STANTZ	Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
VENKMAN	It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?

VENKMAN	And now you're going to eat it?
STANTZ	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

VENKMAN	This is what you do with your spare time?
STANTZ	This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
VENKMAN	'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.

STANTZ	Like a goat on garbage.
STANTZ	We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
VENKMAN	What kind of tests?
STANTZ	Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
VENKMAN	You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

VENKMAN	Did you find anything at Dana's?
STANTZ	Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

VENKMAN	Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
STANTZ	I'll get one more reading.

STANTZ	What happened?
VENKMAN	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

VENKMAN	Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
STANTZ	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
VENKMAN	Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

VENKMAN	I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
STANTZ	Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

STANTZ	You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
VENKMAN	Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
STANTZ	It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.

STANTZ	It looks like a giant Jello mold.
VENKMAN	I hate Jello.

STANTZ	Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
VENKMAN	Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

STANTZ	I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
VENKMAN	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?

STANTZ	I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
VENKMAN	Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.

STANTZ	I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
VENKMAN	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.

STANTZ	My Fault!
VENKMAN	She's new in town.

STANTZ	Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
VENKMAN	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.

VENKMAN	I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
STANTZ	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

STANTZ	My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
VENKMAN	Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?

STANTZ	What's your story, Pete?
VENKMAN	Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.

STANTZ	Ready?
WINSTON	I'm ready.
STANTZ	Then let's do it.

WINSTON	That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
STANTZ	Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.

WINSTON	Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
STANTZ	Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
WINSTON	Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
STANTZ	Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.

WINSTON	Does it have any favorites?
STANTZ	It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

STANTZ	And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
WINSTON	I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.

WINSTON	You got a flux and a half.
STANTZ	Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

WINSTON	Now that's one ugly dude.
STANTZ	Huh?  What?
WINSTON	You finished here?
STANTZ	What?  Yeah.
WINSTON	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
STANTZ	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.

STANTZ	Are you telling me how to drive?
WINSTON	No, I just thought --
STANTZ	Well don't think!

WINSTON	Are you all right?
STANTZ	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

WINSTON	Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
STANTZ	Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
WINSTON	You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
STANTZ	Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.

WINSTON	What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
STANTZ	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.

STANTZ	She's moving!
WINSTON	I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.

WINSTON	Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
STANTZ	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

VENKMAN	I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
WINSTON	Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
VENKMAN	So we'll put a warning on the label.

WINSTON	Tell him about the toaster.
VENKMAN	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

VENKMAN	It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
WINSTON	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

VENKMAN	And pure --
WINSTON	And decent.

VENKMAN	Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
WINSTON	Wonder what?
VENKMAN	If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.

WINSTON	How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
VENKMAN	It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

WINSTON	My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
VENKMAN	Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.

ABE	I need to touch it to "see"...
MANNING	See what??
ABE	The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
MANNING	Is he serious??
ABE	Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.

ABE	They were over here, Professor.
MANNING	Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?

HELLBOY	Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
ABE	Story of my life.
HELLBOY	I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
ABE	You mean, outside... with her.

HELLBOY	Don't get psychic with me.
ABE	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.

HELLBOY	How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
ABE	Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
HELLBOY	We don't take hints.

HELLBOY	Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
ABE	Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.

HELLBOY	Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
ABE	Red, I found something --

HELLBOY	Nah -- he's taken care of.
ABE	No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --

ABE	You were burned by some organic acid.
HELLBOY	I'm lucky that way.

ABE	Red. How long was it latched onto you?
HELLBOY	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!

ABE	Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
HELLBOY	Didn't even buy me a drink.

ABE	Remind me why I keep doing this.
HELLBOY	Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
ABE	Oh, right --

HELLBOY	That's all for you, Sammy.
ABE'S VOICE	Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --

ABE'S VOICE	hound of resurrection --
HELLBOY	See? I don't like that --
ABE'S VOICE	-- Hound of resurrection?

ABE'S VOICE	harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
HELLBOY	Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
ABE'S VOICE	It doesn't say --

BROOM	This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
WHITMAN	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.

BROOM	Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
WHITMAN	What is it?
BROOM	In private, if you don't mind...

WHITMAN	You are a Catholic??
BROOM	Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.

WHITMAN	Here. You'll need one of these.
BROOM	I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
WHITMAN	Three days too late for that one, "professor."

WHITMAN	You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
BROOM	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
WHITMAN	What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
BROOM	Paranormal  But -- you read the transmission.
WHITMAN	Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
BROOM	I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
WHITMAN	Oh, I'll bet you have.

WHITMAN	The freak in the gas mask --
BROOM	Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.

BROOM	If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
WHITMAN	Air and sea backup. What's closest?

BROOM	Cordon off the area. Something came through.
WHITMAN	From where??!!

MATLIN	It's almost over!!
BROOM	No. It's not.

MATLIN	Do you believe in hell?
BROOM	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
MATLIN	Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
BROOM	Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
MATLIN	C'mon -- Rasputin??
BROOM	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
MATLIN	That makes him more than a hundred --

MATLIN	What the hell was that? An ape?
BROOM	No. It was red. Bright red.

MATLIN	It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
BROOM	I think that is its hand.

MANNING	Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
BROOM	I thought you liked being on TV.
MANNING	I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
BROOM	Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
MANNING	Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
BROOM	He's just going through a phase --

MANNING	These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
BROOM	I know where to find him. I'll get him back.

BROOM	A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
HELLBOY	Who wards off demons.
BROOM	Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
HELLBOY	Reliquary --
BROOM	A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.

BROOM	Son. About Rasputin --
HELLBOY	Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
BROOM	Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
HELLBOY	How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
BROOM	I worry about you.
HELLBOY	Me?? C'mon --
BROOM	Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
HELLBOY	Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --

BROOM	Don't look! Turn around.
HELLBOY	Is it bad?

HELLBOY	How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
BROOM	That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.

BROOM	It's her choice --  She's human --
HELLBOY	Oh, as opposed to -- ?

BROOM	They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
MYERS	Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
BROOM	The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.

MYERS	How does he know so much about me?
BROOM	Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
MYERS	Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
BROOM	As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
MYERS	On the desk, yes. In Latin.
BROOM	Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
MYERS	In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt...
BROOM	In the absence of light, darkness prevails. For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.

BROOM	1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
MYERS	1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
BROOM	Did he, now?

MYERS	I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
BROOM	You're doing fine.

BROOM	And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
MYERS	Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."

HELLBOY	Who's the squirt?
CLAY	Agent Myers is your new liaison.
HELLBOY	Got tired of me?
CLAY	Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

HELLBOY	I don't want him.
CLAY	Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.

CLAY	Well, you did break out --
HELLBOY	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
CLAY	It is. You got yourself on TV again.
HELLBOY	Myers, huh? You have a first name??
CLAY	Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.

HELLBOY	Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
CLAY	We're on the move.
HELLBOY	C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!

CLAY	At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
HELLBOY	Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.

CLAY	C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
HELLBOY	This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.

CLAY	They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
MYERS	Grounded? Who's grounded?
CLAY	Okay. You saw the fish man, right?

CLAY	He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
MYERS	Who?!

MYERS	Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
CLAY	Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.

MYERS	Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
CLAY	His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
MYERS	His what??!!

MYERS	Sir, may I go first??
CLAY	Not so fast. He barely knows him --

HELLBOY	That voice --
GRIGORY	I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
HELLBOY	Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.

GRIGORY	She's dead.
HELLBOY	Noooo! Noooo!!!

GRIGORY	Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
HELLBOY	Anung-un-Rama...

GRIGORY	You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
HELLBOY	I can live with that.

MANNING	But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
HELLBOY	I knew those men better than you did --
MANNING	Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.

HELLBOY	No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
MANNING	That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
HELLBOY	What are you trying to say?
MANNING	In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
HELLBOY	I wish I could be more gracious but --

HELLBOY	One falls, two shall arise. So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
MANNING	When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.

MANNING	We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
HELLBOY	Those things never work. Never.
MANNING	Each of us gets a belt.
HELLBOY	I won't take 'em. They never work.

MANNING	We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
HELLBOY	Don't move. We --
MANNING	-- should go back. Now!
HELLBOY	No. Don't --
MANNING	I'm in charge. We go back!

HELLBOY	You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
MANNING	You call that thing a cigar??
HELLBOY	Yup.
MANNING	You never, ever light a cigar that way.

MANNING	Thank you.
HELLBOY	My job.

MYERS	You're kidding --
HELLBOY	Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.

MYERS	Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
HELLBOY	Father's back?  Still angry?

HELLBOY	Whatcha looking at, John??
MYERS	Oh-n-no -- I --

MYERS	Helping you -- I just --
HELLBOY	No one ever helps me. It's my job.

HELLBOY	Myers??? How's your arm?
MYERS	My arm is fine. Where are you??

HELLBOY	I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
MYERS	Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
HELLBOY	No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
MYERS	No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
HELLBOY	Myers?
MYERS	Yes?
HELLBOY	Goodbye.

HELLBOY	What took you so long?
MYERS	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
HELLBOY	What are you, a Boy Scout?
MYERS	No. I never was.
HELLBOY	Could've fooled me. Go away.

MYERS	You want me to hold him down?
HELLBOY	That's right, Stud, hold me down.

MYERS	Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
HELLBOY	Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --

HELLBOY	Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
MYERS	Professor, that girl you were talking about --
HELLBOY	Hey. You: think twice --
MYERS	I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
HELLBOY	What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?

HELLBOY	What was that??
MYERS	Hostage negotiations.

MYERS	Where do you --
HELLBOY	Shh! Just a second.

HELLBOY	Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
MYERS	Need is a good, solid word.
HELLBOY	Nah, sounds too "needy."
MYERS	Start in, you got nachos coming.

MYERS	Hey, your chili's getting cold --
HELLBOY	Not hungry.

MYERS	Anything else you --
HELLBOY	Not from you.
MYERS	Well good n-
HELLBOY	Good night.

MYERS	Are you sure about this?
HELLBOY	On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.

HELLBOY	Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
MYERS	Alone?
HELLBOY	How big can it be?

LIZ	You better have that looked at.
HELLBOY	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.

HELLBOY	We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
LIZ	No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.

HELLBOY	Goodnight, then.
LIZ	Goodnight.

HELLBOY	Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
LIZ	Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
HELLBOY	Out? Out out?
LIZ	For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
HELLBOY	You're going alone?
LIZ	No. Myers is taking me.

HELLBOY	It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
LIZ	Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

HELLBOY	Hi.
LIZ	I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --

HELLBOY	But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
LIZ	Red, I --
HELLBOY	Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
LIZ	I like that...
HELLBOY	Good.

HELLBOY	Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
LIZ	Marco...
HELLBOY	...Polo.

MYERS	Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
LIZ	60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
MYERS	It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.

MYERS	Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
LIZ	Doesn't sounds like him.
MYERS	Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.

MYERS	I admire him. He's a force of nature.
LIZ	He's just pushy.
MYERS	No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
LIZ	Cocky.
MYERS	Strong.
LIZ	A brute.
MYERS	My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.

MYERS	He -- loves you.
LIZ	I know.
MYERS	What about you?
LIZ	Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --

MYERS	It's freezing, isn't it?
LIZ	Coffee's warming me up.

MYERS	But it's not true, is it?
LIZ	What -- ?
MYERS	That you feel that way about me.
LIZ	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.

LIZ	Hit me.
MYERS	What?

MYERS	Hello, I'm --
LOBBY GUARD	-- Late. Five minutes late.
MYERS	Yes, I --
LOBBY GUARD	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
MYERS	Pardon?
LOBBY GUARD	Two steps back, please.

BRENNA	I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
DENNIS	Maybe he's hiding from something.
BRENNA	Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.

DENNIS	Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
BRENNA	Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
DENNIS	How old is Richard?
BRENNA	P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
DENNIS	Find the father.  That should clear things up.

DENNIS	Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
BRENNA	Yeah.
DENNIS	He'd want to know about all this.
BRENNA	Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
DENNIS	Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.

DENNIS	Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
BRENNA	Sure.

DENNIS	I warned you.
BRENNA	Go to hell.

BRENNA	Doesn't have a head, does he?
EXAMINER	This one came unassembled.

EXAMINER	How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
BRENNA	Fine.

EXAMINER	Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
BRENNA	Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
EXAMINER	Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
BRENNA	Claymore.
EXAMINER	Huh?
BRENNA	Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
EXAMINER	You're the expert.
BRENNA	It's in good condition.

MAN	That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
BRENNA	There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
MAN	You're very macabre.
BRENNA	It's my birthday.
MAN	Happy birthday.
BRENNA	Thanks.

KIDELL	Would you like more tea?
BRENNA	No thank you, I'm fine.

KIDELL	He was unsual.
BRENNA	Why?
KIDELL	Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
BRENNA	Then you didn't know Richard later on.
KIDELL	No.
BRENNA	I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
KIDELL	Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
BRENNA	I don't follow you.
KIDELL	Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
BRENNA	The boy _died_?
KIDELL	Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.

BRENNA	Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
KIDELL	There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
BRENNA	Would you remember his name?
KIDELL	Carl Smith.

DESK OFFICER	This is against the rules.
BRENNA	So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
DESK OFFICER	-Okay okay.
BRENNA	You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.

DESK OFFICER	Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
BRENNA	Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
DESK OFFICER	Anything in Maryland is close.

BRENNA	Do you play?
TAUPIN	Yes.
BRENNA	Very traditional.

TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
BRENNA	I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
TAUPIN	It's not mine.
BRENNA	It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.

BRENNA	Byzantine?
TAUPIN	Basil the II.
BRENNA	Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
TAUPIN	-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-

BRENNA	Good reflexes.
TAUPIN	Good day, Miss Cartwright.

BRENNA	Someone beat you.
TAUPIN	Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
BRENNA	Grave robbers?
TAUPIN	Probably.
BRENNA	Who?
TAUPIN	People like that rarely leave business cards.
BRENNA	Does Carl Smith?

TAUPIN	I don't know what you're talking about.
BRENNA	I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
TAUPIN	You have an active imagination.
BRENNA	I've been to Church Hill.
TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.

BRENNA	I have friends.
TAUPIN	I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.

BRENNA	Jesus Christ.
TAUPIN	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
BRENNA	Why not?
TAUPIN	Tradition.
BRENNA	What the hell is going on?

BRENNA	He tried to kill me last night.
TAUPIN	Where?
BRENNA	Dupont Circle.

BRENNA	Who is he?
TAUPIN	At the moment?  Carl Smith.
BRENNA	And you?

BRENNA	What will you do now?
TAUPIN	You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
BRENNA	He called you "MacLeod".
TAUPIN	Not your concern.
BRENNA	I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
TAUPIN	That bothers you?
BRENNA	He was innocent.
TAUPIN	He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
BRENNA	What about me?
TAUPIN	You?
BRENNA	I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
TAUPIN	Have you gone to the police?
BRENNA	No.
TAUPIN	Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
BRENNA	I'd rather hear yours.
TAUPIN	You are being foolish.
BRENNA	I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
TAUPIN	Go home.

TAUPIN	He sees me as a threat.
BRENNA	Are you?

BRENNA	No.
TAUPIN	No one knows you're here?
BRENNA	No.  I had to talk to you.
TAUPIN	You had to do _nothing_!
BRENNA	You're wrong.
TAUPIN	You're a fool.
BRENNA	Maybe.

BRENNA	Is this what you killed them with?
TAUPIN	You've been listening to rumors.
BRENNA	Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
TAUPIN	You are.  Now.

BRENNA	What's all that?
TAUPIN	Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.

BRENNA	You did kill those men.
TAUPIN	Not all of them.
BRENNA	When you finish, what then?
TAUPIN	I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
BRENNA	You make it all sound so simple.
TAUPIN	The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
BRENNA	You want me to front for you.
TAUPIN	The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.

TAUPIN	There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
BRENNA	Yes.
TAUPIN	I wish I could.

BRENNA	The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
TAUPIN	It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.

BRENNA	No.  So what now?  We just wait?
TAUPIN	Yes.
BRENNA	Well, as long as we're stuck here.

BRENNA	It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
TAUPIN	They do it each year.
BRENNA	I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.

TAUPIN	Maybe it would do us both good.
BRENNA	There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.

TAUPIN	Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
BRENNA	It's beautiful.
TAUPIN	A little dusty.

BRENNA	I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
TAUPIN	Follow me.

BRENNA	William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
TAUPIN	Yes.
BRENNA	And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
TAUPIN	Yes.

BRENNA	You're using your son's name.
TAUPIN	No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.

BRENNA	Then you must be at least 70 years old.
TAUPIN	At least.
BRENNA	That's impossible.

BRENNA	It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
TAUPIN	A factor of age.
BRENNA	I hope I never get that old.
TAUPIN	You won't.

BRENNA	I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
TAUPIN	Why are you here?
BRENNA	I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
TAUPIN	I see.
BRENNA	I'm not even sure why.
TAUPIN	Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
BRENNA	My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
TAUPIN	You are a very perceptive young woman.
BRENNA	Just a little crazy.

BRENNA	Who are you?
TAUPIN	That would be difficult to explain.
BRENNA	I'd like you to try.

TAUPIN	I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
BRENNA	That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
TAUPIN	Yes.
BRENNA	He knows about you.
TAUPIN	He is older than I.
BRENNA	What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
TAUPIN	Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
BRENNA	That's insane.
TAUPIN	Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
BRENNA	Of bodies.
TAUPIN	I didn't kill the watchman.
BRENNA	You killed those other two.
TAUPIN	Not the same.
BRENNA	What about that family in '31?
TAUPIN	Sometimes innocents become involved.
BRENNA	You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
TAUPIN	There are differences.
BRENNA	You kill with your left hand?
TAUPIN	I haven't killed _you_.
BRENNA	Is that a threat?

BRENNA	Don't.
TAUPIN	Come here, Brenna.
BRENNA	Damn you.

BRENNA	What is it like?  Being you?
TAUPIN	Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
BRENNA	But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
TAUPIN	It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
BRENNA	What is it you want?
TAUPIN	All of it finished.

TAUPIN	Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
BRENNA	Will I see you again?
TAUPIN	Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.

BRENNA	What's wrong?
TAUPIN	I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!

BRENNA	What is it?
TAUPIN	I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!

TAUPIN	Get out.
BRENNA	No!
TAUPIN	I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...

TAUPIN	The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
BRENNA	The inheritance.
TAUPIN	Not power.  Not control.

TAUPIN	Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
BRENNA	You have lived forever.
TAUPIN	Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.

TAUPIN	It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
BRENNA	Yes.

UNCLE JOE	Forget it.
BRENNA	I'm just curious.
UNCLE JOE	You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.

UNCLE JOE	Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
BRENNA	Now there's a new topic.
UNCLE JOE	Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?

UNCLE JOE	Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
BRENNA	Thanks.
UNCLE JOE	Call your mother.  You never call her.

MORAN	A murder.
BRENNA	You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
MORAN	I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
BRENNA	What do you want from me?
MORAN	Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.

BRENNA	I'm calling an attorney.
MORAN	You and I should talk first.
BRENNA	We've got nothing to say.

MORAN	What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
BRENNA	Four?
MORAN	All fashionably without heads.
BRENNA	Spare me the details.
MORAN	But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
BRENNA	What are you getting at, Moran?
MORAN	You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
BRENNA	It'll never stick.
MORAN	But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
BRENNA	You're an asshole, Moran.
MORAN	I want Taupin.
BRENNA	What makes you so sure he's the one?
MORAN	Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
BRENNA	What's all of this got to do with me?
MORAN	What were you doing in Felton?
BRENNA	Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
MORAN	I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
BRENNA	Never take up poker, Detective.
MORAN	Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.

LIBRARIAN	Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
BRENNA	All I need is for you to check the name.
LIBRARIAN	You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
BRENNA	I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.

BRENNA	Corey, you _owe_ me.
LIBRARIAN	It's that important?
BRENNA	Yeah.

LIBRARIAN	Good way to lose your job.
BRENNA	Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
LIBRARIAN	I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
BRENNA	It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
LIBRARIAN	You always were hard to impress.

BRENNA	Who is it?
LIBRARIAN	Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.

BRENNA	I don't believe him.
SUPERVISOR	Why?
BRENNA	He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.

SUPERVISOR	Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
BRENNA	I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?

BRENNA	Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
SUPERVISOR	You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
BRENNA	Give it a rest Ned, huh?

TAVERN MAN #2	Requiem acer'nam donaei-
CONOR	What are you doing man?
TAVERN MAN #2	-Et lux perpetua-
CONOR	You'll not be bringing the church into this.
TAVERN MAN #2	-Luceat ei-

CONOR	Be quiet.
TAVERN MAN #2	-Auditorium nostrum-
CONOR	Stop.
TAVERN MAN #2	-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
CONOR	Stop!

CONOR	Afternoon.
ROMIREZ	Your name is Conor?
CONOR	Aye.
ROMIREZ	Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
CONOR	You're not from these parts.
ROMIREZ	I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.

CONOR	I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
ROMIREZ	Please go to no trouble.

ROMIREZ	Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
CONOR	Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
ROMIREZ	Your marks would suggest great injury.
CONOR	I was nearly killed.
ROMIREZ	But you lived.

CONOR	I did at that.
ROMIREZ	And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
CONOR	Aye.
ROMIREZ	I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.

CONOR	I was driven out.
ROMIREZ	And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
CONOR	How can you know this?
ROMIREZ	First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.

ROMIREZ	Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
CONOR	Pheasant.
ROMIREZ	You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
CONOR	Why are you here?
ROMIREZ	I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
CONOR	You're a long way from Inverness.
ROMIREZ	In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
CONOR	You know me home.  Me name.
ROMIREZ	It was time for our paths to cross.

ROMIREZ	When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
CONOR	You are the same?
ROMIREZ	Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
CONOR	Yes.  Always.
ROMIREZ	Does it change with me in the room?
CONOR	It is less.
ROMIREZ	You feel you know me.
CONOR	I don't know why.
ROMIREZ	We are brothers.

CONOR	He told me there could be only one.
ROMIREZ	Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
CONOR	I don't understand.
ROMIREZ	You are still so very young.
CONOR	I'm twenty-two.
ROMIREZ	Not even a single lifetime.

ROMIREZ	Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
CONOR	What?
ROMIREZ	We are immortal.

ROMIREZ	It is as you are.
CONOR	No!

ROMIREZ	Listen to me.  Hear the words.
CONOR	This is madness!
ROMIREZ	It is the truth.
CONOR	No!

ROMIREZ	Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
CONOR	This can't be.
ROMIREZ	You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
CONOR	This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
ROMIREZ	You'd have to die first.  Aqui.

CONOR	What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
ROMIREZ	You will live.  Survive.
CONOR	Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
ROMIREZ	You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
CONOR	Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.

CONOR	Why does he want to kill me?
ROMIREZ	You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
CONOR	Aye.
ROMIREZ	It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
CONOR	But we cannot be killed.
ROMIREZ	There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
CONOR	How can I stop such a man?
ROMIREZ	Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
CONOR	Why?
ROMIREZ	We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.

ROMIREZ	Harder.  Concentrate harder.
CONOR	Me arm hurts.
ROMIREZ	Again.  Try again.

ROMIREZ	Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
CONOR	Go to hell.
ROMIREZ	Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.

CONOR	Impotent cow.
ROMIREZ	Muy Bien!

ROMIREZ	It will take less effort as you learn.
CONOR	It's like to kill me first.

ROMIREZ	You have a gift.  One you must protect.
CONOR	And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
ROMIREZ	The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
CONOR	If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.

CONOR	You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
ROMIREZ	Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

CONOR	What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
ROMIREZ	All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.

ROMIREZ	As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
CONOR	I do not think I like the sound of that.
ROMIREZ	It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
CONOR	I feel hardly nothing.
ROMIREZ	You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
CONOR	But why be so concerned about me?
ROMIREZ	This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
CONOR	And you?
ROMIREZ	I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
CONOR	I am not ready for this.
ROMIREZ	You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
CONOR	Of course.
ROMIREZ	You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
CONOR	That is not me.
ROMIREZ	With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.

ROMIREZ	Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
CONOR	I'll be back when I can.

CONOR	I'm your future husband, remember?
MARA	I have no future husband.
CONOR	I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.

MARA	My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
CONOR	What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
MARA	You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
CONOR	But I did live.
MARA	Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
CONOR	So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
MARA	Some think not.
CONOR	Who?
MARA	There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
CONOR	That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
MARA	I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
CONOR	You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
MARA	Me father has taken back my hand.

MARA	Please not be touching me, Conor.
CONOR	I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
MARA	Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
CONOR	You're not talking sense, Mara!

CONOR	If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
MARA	Do what you must.

KATHERINE	Oh please.  Another one.
CONOR	What would you like?
KATHERINE	Something pretty.
CONOR	Like you.

KATHERINE	That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
CONOR	Far away.
KATHERINE	Kiss me.

KATHERINE	David.
CONOR	Do you have cause to bothering us?

DUPONT	Who am I deceiving?
KNIGHT	Certainly not me.

KNIGHT	State of grace and all that.
DUPONT	Tradition.
KNIGHT	It's all we have.

DUPONT	Not so scared.
KNIGHT	Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
DUPONT	No doubt.
KNIGHT	You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
DUPONT	You're wrong.
KNIGHT	I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.

DUPONT	Romirez understood.  Not you.
KNIGHT	Romirez is dust.

KNIGHT	Finish your prayers?
DUPONT	Finish yours?
KNIGHT	Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
DUPONT	So sure?

MAJOR	Complete your inspection?
DUPONT	They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
MAJOR	I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
DUPONT	We need more time.
MAJOR	Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.

MAJOR	Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
DUPONT	Not likely.

DUPONT	Your name?
MULET	Mulet.

DUPONT	I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
MULET	Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
DUPONT	What is your position?
MULET	Second musketeer.
DUPONT	I understand you joined up in Bremen.
MULET	You seem to understand a great deal.
DUPONT	I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
MULET	Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
DUPONT	Equals?
MULET	If you wish to play games, Major.

DUPONT	Wait.  I think we understand each other.
MULET	We have no understanding.
DUPONT	Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.

MULET	Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
DUPONT	It can be different.  It must be.
MULET	It never changes, Major.

DUPONT	We must talk.
MULET	Stay out of it.
DUPONT	Don't threaten me, Private.
MULET	Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.

DUPONT	Do not turn your back on me.
MULET	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
DUPONT	Either you are with me or against me.

MULET	You see Major?  You are not so different...
DUPONT	I had no choice.

FATHER	Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
MOTHER	Have you time for some- thing to eat?

FATHER	Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
MOTHER	Must he go?
FATHER	Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
MOTHER	But Ian, he's still but a boy.
FATHER	He's a MacLeod.

TAUPIN	Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
GRANDSON	Thanks.

TAUPIN	Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
GRANDSON	Where did you learn that?
TAUPIN	My father taught me.
GRANDSON	Your father must be smart.
TAUPIN	Yes, he was.

MORAN	I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
INSPECTOR	Figure she's with him?
MORAN	Yeah.
INSPECTOR	We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
MORAN	Any other I.D.s come up?
INSPECTOR	Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.

MORAN	Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
INSPECTOR	You'd think he'd had practice.

MORAN	Are you sure?
INSPECTOR	Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
MORAN	Round up who you can and put them on standby.
INSPECTOR	Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
MORAN	No.  I want this to be all ours.

TAUPIN	Where!
INTRUDER	I don't know.
TAUPIN	What name is he using?

INTRUDER	Smith.  Carl Smith.
TAUPIN	How many came?
INTRUDER	The last four.
TAUPIN	And the Bulgarian?
INTRUDER	He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
TAUPIN	He knows I'm here.  How?
INTRUDER	None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...

TAUPIN	_Answer_ me.
INTRUDER	We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...

KAHN	Spare a chair?
TAUPIN	Kahn?
KAHN	Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
TAUPIN	Sit.

TAUPIN	How are you?
KAHN	Head still secure to the neck.
TAUPIN	How did you find me?
KAHN	How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?

KAHN	Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
TAUPIN	What are you doing here?
KAHN	It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.

TAUPIN	And have you something to settle with me?
KAHN	Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
TAUPIN	It's good to see you, Kahn.

KAHN	I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
TAUPIN	Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
KAHN	But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
TAUPIN	Offered the Pope one of his whores.

TAUPIN	Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
KAHN	Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.

TAUPIN	He found us even there.
KAHN	He always did.

TAUPIN	I haven't drunk this much since-
KAHN	-Since you last saw me.

KAHN	I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
TAUPIN	You were never a kid.

KAHN	I knew his great-grandfather.
TAUPIN	You're insane.
KAHN	No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
TAUPIN	How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
KAHN	Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
TAUPIN	I've had a few more concerns.

KAHN	The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
TAUPIN	You're wrong.
KAHN	You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.

KNIGHT	Long time.
TAUPIN	Not so long.

TAUPIN	You've been here from the start.
KNIGHT	My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.

KNIGHT	Friend of yours?
TAUPIN	Of sorts.
KNIGHT	I do hope she enjoys a good show.

TAUPIN	Run!
KNIGHT	MACLEOD!

KNIGHT	You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
TAUPIN	Leave her out of this.
KNIGHT	As you wish.

TAUPIN	What's the point?
KNIGHT	This isn't done.  Get up.
TAUPIN	What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
KNIGHT	I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
TAUPIN	Tradition.
KNIGHT	It's all we have.
TAUPIN	Go to hell.

KNIGHT	Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
TAUPIN	Leave her alone.
KNIGHT	Get up.

KNIGHT'S VOICE	We have some unfinished business.
TAUPIN	Are you here?
KNIGHT'S VOICE	I want you to come to me.
TAUPIN	And if I refuse?
KNIGHT'S VOICE	Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.

KNIGHT'S VOICE	Yes laddie, I have her.
TAUPIN	Should I care?

MORAN	This your present address?
TAUPIN	Yes.
MORAN	Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
TAUPIN	I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
MORAN	Did you know the victim?
TAUPIN	No.
MORAN	His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
TAUPIN	It doesn't.
MORAN	He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.

MORAN	Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
TAUPIN	American.

MORAN	Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
TAUPIN	What are you getting at?
MORAN	Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.

MORAN	What were _you_ looking for?
TAUPIN	That's none of your business.
MORAN	You're wrong.

MORAN	Do you know what this is?
TAUPIN	I presume it's a sword.
MORAN	A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
TAUPIN	Your murder weapon?
MORAN	It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
TAUPIN	A mystery.
MORAN	For the moment.

TAUPIN	My condolences.
MORAN	Where were you Tuesday night?
TAUPIN	Home.
MORAN	A neighbor saw your car leave.
TAUPIN	He's mistaken.

MORAN	Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
TAUPIN	Do you?
MORAN	All I need is time.
TAUPIN	I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.

MOTHER	Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
TRAVELLER	I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
MOTHER	You're a kind man to be sure.
TRAVELLER	I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
MOTHER	Steven, Conor didn't die.
TRAVELLER	But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
MOTHER	They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.

MR. NORTH	When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
TAUPIN	The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
MR. NORTH	Oh yes, more than enough.

MR. NORTH	You're one of William's kids, huh?
TAUPIN	His only kid.
MR. NORTH	Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
TAUPIN	We were very close.
MR. NORTH	The resemblance is amazing.
TAUPIN	When may I expect the cleaners?
MR. NORTH	I'll send them right up.

MR. NORTH	Morning Mr. North
TAUPIN	Same.
MR. NORTH	Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
TAUPIN	No.
MR. NORTH	Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
TAUPIN	I'm sure that's true.

TAUPIN	Nothing to be sorry about.
MR. NORTH	Just your pappy scared some.

PHILIP	Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
ALICIA	It's really nice of you to help us.
PHILIP	I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
ALICIA	We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
PHILIP	Cool.

ALICIA	This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
PHILIP	If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.

CONSTANCE	What do you want?
DAVID	You have to leave the White House.
CONSTANCE	This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
DAVID	You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.

CONSTANCE	In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
DAVID	I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
CONSTANCE	You're being paranoid.
DAVID	It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...

CONSTANCE	What?
DAVID	Connie, don't hang up.
CONSTANCE	David? How'd you get this number?
DAVID	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.

CONSTANCE	And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
DAVID	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.

CONSTANCE	What do you want me to do?
DAVID	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
CONSTANCE	I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
DAVID	He's not going to listen to me.

DAVID	You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
CONSTANCE	David, don't...

DAVID	Just my luck, no ice.
CONSTANCE	I take it you've heard.
DAVID	A toast to the end of the world.

DAVID	You still believe in him.
CONSTANCE	He's a good man.
DAVID	Better be. You left me for him.
CONSTANCE	I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?

CONSTANCE	Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
DAVID	We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.

CONSTANCE	With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
DAVID	If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?

CONSTANCE	Are you all right?
DAVID	Did it work?
CONSTANCE	You bet it did.

CONSTANCE	David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
MOISHE	Punched the President? Oh my god.

MOISHE	Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
CONSTANCE	My ex-husband works in satellite communications.

CONSTANCE	He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
MOISHE	Think nothing of it, Spanky.

CONSTANCE	Spunky. He told you about that?
MOISHE	All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
CONSTANCE	Love was never our problem.
MOISHE	All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.

PRESIDENT	Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
CONSTANCE	More than likely.

CONSTANCE	I don't know how you put up with him.
PRESIDENT	He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
CONSTANCE	I'll bet.

CONSTANCE	You saved a lot of lives.
PRESIDENT	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?

CONSTANCE	We're losing them.
PRESIDENT	Then get them out of there.

MARTY	What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
DAVID	It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
MARTY	Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.

DAVID	What the hell is this?
MARTY	So sue me.

DAVID	Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
MARTY	Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?

DAVID	Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
MARTY	We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.

DAVID	There's good news and bad news.
MARTY	What's the bad news?
DAVID	You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
MARTY	And the good news is you won't charge me.
DAVID	No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
MARTY	That's the good news?

DAVID	Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
MARTY	...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.

DAVID	I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
MARTY	Huh? Oh, good, good.
DAVID	Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
MARTY	Can you believe this?
DAVID	What're you talking about?
MARTY	Haven't you been watching?

DAVID	Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
MARTY	What happened?
DAVID	Just do it!

MARTY	Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
DAVID	Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
MARTY	Not really...
DAVID	That signal. It's a countdown.
MARTY	A countdown to what?
DAVID	Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.

MARTY	Then what?
DAVID	Checkmate.

MOISHE	What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
DAVID	I'm thinking.
MOISHE	So think already.

DAVID	You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
MOISHE	You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.

MOISHE	David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
DAVID	Dad, don't start.
MOISHE	I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
DAVID	Three years.
MOISHE	Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.

DAVID	Pops!
MOISHE	The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
DAVID	You still got the Olds?
MOISHE	You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
DAVID	That's okay. You're driving.

MOISHE	It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
DAVID	Can't this thing go any faster?
MOISHE	You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
DAVID	They don't know this.
MOISHE	And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
DAVID	Dad...
MOISHE	All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.

MOISHE	What the hell is that?
DAVID	This, pops, is every phone book in America.
MOISHE	You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
DAVID	She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...

MOISHE	Not listed, huh?
DAVID	I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
MOISHE	Spunky?
DAVID	College nickname.
MOISHE	You try Martin?
DAVID	She didn't take my name when we were married.

DAVID	Perfect, she's using it.
MOISHE	It's perfect the line is busy?
DAVID	Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
MOISHE	You can do that?

MOISHE	Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
DAVID	Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
MOISHE	You punched the President in the face?
DAVID	He wasn't the President then.

MOISHE	It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
DAVID	Moishe, please, don't talk.

DAVID	Dad, please...
MOISHE	What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!

MOISHE	David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
DAVID	I'm making a mess.
MOISHE	This I can see.
DAVID	We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
MOISHE	David, you're drunk.

DAVID	Pops, you're a genius!
MOISHE	What'd I say?
DAVID	A cold? Of course.

DAVID	Thanks, Pops.
MOISHE	I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.

DAVID	I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
STEVE	Oh shit, we're late.
DAVID	We'll meet you there.

DAVID	I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
STEVE	Great.

DAVID	What the hell are you doing?
STEVE	Just getting a feel for her.

DAVID	Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
STEVE	Looks like they're preparing the invasion.

DAVID	Get us out of here!
STEVE	I can't shake her free.

STEVE	What're you doing?
DAVID	It's not me. They're overriding the system.

STEVE	Nice meeting you.
DAVID	You as well.

STEVE	We're loose!
DAVID	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
STEVE	I don't hear no fat lady.

GENERAL GREY	With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
PRESIDENT	I had a feeling you would.
GENERAL GREY	Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
PRESIDENT	Then God help us.

PRESIDENT	General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
GENERAL GREY	But Mr. President...
PRESIDENT	And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.

PRESIDENT	Is my wife in the air?
GENERAL GREY	She should be shortly.

PRESIDENT	Any news on my wife?
GENERAL GREY	The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.

PRESIDENT	Where are they?
GENERAL GREY	ETA with target; four minutes.

PRESIDENT	Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
GENERAL GREY	And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.

PRESIDENT	And our forces?
GENERAL GREY	We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
PRESIDENT	We're being exterminated.

PRESIDENT	Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
GENERAL GREY	Yes, Sir.

PRESIDENT	How're we doing?
GENERAL GREY	Better than we thought.

GENERAL GREY	We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
PRESIDENT	And our troops here?
GENERAL GREY	We've been collecting planes from all over but...
PRESIDENT	But what, General?
GENERAL GREY	Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
PRESIDENT	Then find them.

GENERAL GREY	Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
PRESIDENT	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.

PRESIDENT	Grey, you read me?
GENERAL GREY	Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

PRESIDENT	Where's it headed?
GENERAL GREY	I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.

GENERAL GREY	Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
PRESIDENT	Roger.

NIMZIKI	Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
GENERAL GREY	That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.

NIMZIKI	Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
GENERAL GREY	Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.

GENERAL GREY	More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
NIMZIKI	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
GENERAL GREY	We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.

NIMZIKI	That's impossible...
GENERAL GREY	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
NIMZIKI	Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!

GENERAL GREY	You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
NIMZIKI	It had been deemed classified.
GENERAL GREY	Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!

NIMZIKI	This is ridiculous.
GENERAL GREY	How long would their shields be down?

GENERAL GREY	With their shields down it might be possible.
NIMZIKI	Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.

GENERAL GREY	A meteor?
SECOND OFFICER	No Sir. Definitely not.
GENERAL GREY	How do you know?
SECOND OFFICER	Well, er... it's slowing down.
GENERAL GREY	It's doing what?
SECOND OFFICER	It's... slowing down, Sir.

JASMINE	He's trying to impress you.
STEVE	He's doing a good job.

JASMINE	You can't go. Call them back.
STEVE	Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
JASMINE	You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
STEVE	They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?

JASMINE	Wait. I have to tell you something.
STEVE	What?
JASMINE	Be careful.
STEVE	Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
JASMINE	Really? You don't mind?
STEVE	Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.

JASMINE	You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
STEVE	Yes, I am.
JASMINE	Dick-weed!
STEVE	Butt-munch.

JASMINE	You're late.
STEVE	You know how I like to make a big entrance.

JASMINE	You're late.
STEVE	You know me...
JASMINE	I know, you like to make a big entrance.

STEVE	Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
JASMINE	Sorry for what?
STEVE	I should have done this a long long time ago.

JASMINE	You scared the hell out of me.
STEVE	Yeah, but what an entrance!
JASMINE	Dick-weed.
STEVE	Butt-munch.

MARGARET	Your son.
JASMINE	He's my angel.
MARGARET	Was his father stationed here?
JASMINE	He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.

MARGARET	So, what do you do for a living?
JASMINE	I'm a dancer.
MARGARET	Really? Ballet?
JASMINE	No. Exotic.
MARGARET	Oh. Sorry.
JASMINE	Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.

MARGARET	And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
JASMINE	Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.

JASMINE	Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
MARGARET	I thought you didn't recognize me.
JASMINE	Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.

JIMMY	I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
STEVE	How to kiss ass.

JIMMY	Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
STEVE	I thought you said you were doing to break it off.

JIMMY	That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
STEVE	Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
JIMMY	I hear you.

STEVE	I shouldn't have left her.
JIMMY	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.

STEVE	Damn it!
JIMMY	I didn't even see them fire!
STEVE	Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.

STEVE	Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
JIMMY	We're already over Mach 2!
STEVE	So push it!

JIMMY	Stevie... I can't...
STEVE	Jimmy, stay with me.

MIGUEL	Stop it.
TROY	It's all fuzzy.
MIGUEL	You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.

TROY	I don't need it.
MIGUEL	Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.

TROY	He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
MIGUEL	Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
TROY	That'd be cool!

MIGUEL	But I gave you some this morning.
TROY	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.

MIGUEL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
RUSSELL	I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
MIGUEL	It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
RUSSELL	You sure?
MIGUEL	Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?

MIGUEL	They let you out?
RUSSELL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?

MIGUEL	We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
RUSSELL	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.

RUSSELL	Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
MIGUEL	For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?

MIGUEL	I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
RUSSELL	We should leave too.
MIGUEL	There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.

MIGUEL	How' he doing?
RUSSELL	Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?

PRESIDENT	I'm not leaving.
NIMZIKI	We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
PRESIDENT	I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
NIMZIKI	But, Mr. President...
PRESIDENT	So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.

NIMZIKI	What the hell's going on?
PRESIDENT	We're leaving.

NIMZIKI	I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
PRESIDENT	Above American soil?
NIMZIKI	If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.

PRESIDENT	Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
NIMZIKI	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.

NIMZIKI	Mr. President?
PRESIDENT	Deploy.

PRESIDENT	Call them back.
NIMZIKI	The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
PRESIDENT	I said call them back.

OKUN	Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
PRESIDENT	Yes.
OKUN	Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.

OKUN	See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
PRESIDENT	People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!

PRESIDENT	What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
OKUN	Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?

PRESIDENT	Can they be killed?
OKUN	These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

PRESIDENT	Why did you people come here?
OKUN/ALIEN	Air... water... your "sun."
PRESIDENT	Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
OKUN/ALIEN	Here... now.
PRESIDENT	And before here?
OKUN/ALIEN	Many worlds...
PRESIDENT	Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
OKUN/ALIEN	Peace? No peace.
PRESIDENT	What do you want us to do?
OKUN/ALIEN	Die.

AL	I said something.
JOE	I know you did!

AL	No, not her. Me.
JOE	Who's you?

AL	My name is AL.
JOE	Al ???!!!

JOE	Where are you,...Al?
AL	You're not gonna believe this...
JOE	Try me.
AL	I'm...inside you.

JOE	I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
AL	What's going on?

JOE	...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
AL	Don't do that.
JOE	Why not.

JOE	Arrrgh!
AL	It wasn't him.
JOE	Who was it?
AL	Me.
JOE	Who?
AL	Al.

JOE	Al.
AL	Yes?
JOE	This candid camera?

JOE	You're in my head...
AL	Yes.
JOE	Your name is Al...
AL	Yes.
JOE	I see...

JOE	No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
AL	What is your name?
JOE	You're in my head? You don't know my name?
AL	I just got here.
JOE	What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
AL	Where are we?
JOE	Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
AL	What street?
JOE	What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
AL	Why don't we go home?
JOE	Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
AL	...I need to make a phone call.
JOE	Do me a favor, Al.
AL	Yeah?
JOE	Shut up!

JOE	Somebody's been here.
AL	Where are we now?
JOE	My place, can't you see?
AL	No.
JOE	You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
AL	Right.
JOE	Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
AL	I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
JOE	Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.

AL	Who are you?
JOE	Who am I?
AL	Yeah...Who?
JOE	Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!

AL	Quit screwing around, this is important.
JOE	It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
AL	I told you, my name is Al.
JOE	What are you doing in my head, Al?

AL	You've heard of the PEM114...
JOE	That a new Datsun?

JOE	Are you threatening me?
AL	I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.

AL	Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
JOE	Me? What'd I do?
AL	Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
JOE	I don't know what you're talking about.
AL	The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
JOE	No.
AL	You've heard of U.S.T.?
JOE	I just went there for a job.
AL	Then how'd I get here?

AL	I know...it sounds insane.
JOE	You said it.

AL	What are you doing?
JOE	Loading a gun.
AL	What for?
JOE	Kill myself.
AL	Are you crazy?
JOE	Yep.
AL	Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
JOE	Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
AL	You're not crazy.
JOE	Hear voices don't I.
AL	Of course you do!
JOE	Then I'm crazy.

AL	You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
JOE	You're gonna explain.
AL	Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
AL	Yeah.
JOE	Why he's argumentative?
AL	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.

AL	You'll be alive.
JOE	With a man in my head...
AL	Yeah.

AL	What was that?
JOE	Who was that? Somebody out there?

AL	You weren't listening!
JOE	Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
AL	Why don't you?

AL	No they won't.
JOE	Why not?
AL	I'll talk to them.
JOE	Oh...Gooood!
AL	I'll tell you what to say.
JOE	If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
AL	If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.

AL	Anyone there?
JOE	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

AL	Behind us?
JOE	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

AL	What's that?
JOE	Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.

AL	What'd he look like?
JOE	He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Outrun them.
JOE	This is a Fiesta!

JOE	Now what?
AL	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

JOE	I wouldn't say that.
AL	Then what are you stopping for?

AL	Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
JOE	Can't see a Goddamn thi..

JOE	I want out.
AL	Too late...They want you.
JOE	Why? AL  You know too much.
JOE	I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
AL	You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?

AL	Calm Down! Act rational.
JOE	How do you act when someone trys to kill you?

JOE	I don't know...To get Al.
AL	No. Don't tell the guards.

AL	Did you hear that?
JOE	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!

AL	It can't take that long.
JOE	Why?

JOE	JOE Or what?
AL	I don't know. I don't want to find out.

JOE	They could put you back in the tube..
AL	I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
JOE	Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
AL	They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
JOE	Yeah...Who is?
AL	I am. You are.
JOE	You are CRAZY!
AL	You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
JOE	What do you mean we.
AL	You gotta help.
JOE	I did. I brought you back here.
AL	We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
JOE	Thanks.
AL	Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
JOE	I'm not leaving until you do.

AL	Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
JOE	Find You?
AL	I'm not gonna make it easy.

AL	They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
JOE	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.

AL	Sue them.
JOE	I'll sue.

JOE	I don't like the sound of that.
AL	We have to get out of here.
JOE	Door's locked.
AL	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993

JOE	Now what.
AL	Go out, take your first left.
JOE	Just walk down the hall?
AL	With Authority!

JOE	Which way do I go?
AL	What does it say.
JOE	Corridor A.
AL	Take a left and your next right.
JOE	Where are we going?

JOE	A lab and equipment.
AL	Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
JOE	I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
AL	Who did?
JOE	The man.

AL	Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
JOE	I can't remember..

JOE	Like the guys that attacked us.
AL	What do you mean?
JOE	Black suits and helmets.
AL	That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
JOE	That's not a good idea.
AL	They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
JOE	Gone where?
AL	Don't know.

JOE	You need ID in there?
AL	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
JOE	I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
AL	You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.

AL	Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
JOE	Nothing!

AL	Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
JOE	Just scratched my arm, why?
AL	I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
JOE	The airport! Hey, wait a minute.

AL	I'm back.
JOE	I'm at the airport.
AL	Good. Get to a phone.

JOE	Who is it?
AL	Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.

AL	Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
JOE	What am I supposed to do?
AL	Nothing. You just do nothing.

JOE	What is it?
AL	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...

JOE	What do we do?
AL	Send a man there. A secret agent.
JOE	Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
AL	You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...

JOE	You mean...just leave.
AL	We get on a plane.
JOE	We get on which plane?

JOE	What about money?
AL	What about it?
JOE	I don't have any.
AL	Use my credit cards.
JOE	I can't do that.
AL	Why not?
JOE	It's illegal.
AL	Who cares?
JOE	I'll get in trouble.
AL	You are in trouble. Now do it.

JOE	...and a license to kill...
AL	Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.

JOE	They'll know who I am.
AL	We'll change your appearance.

JOE	It's just not enough.
AL	It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
JOE	What's wrong with how I carry myself.
AL	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
JOE	Oh yeah, to what?
AL	You'll be me.
JOE	I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
AL	Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
JOE	You leave my glands alone!

JOE	Now what?
AL	The beach.
JOE	The beach?
AL	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
JOE	Eating sushi?
AL	Just get there.

JOE	Holy shit!
AL	What is it?
JOE	...Just beautiful.

AL	Do you notice anything.
JOE	The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
AL	Swim.
JOE	Good Idea!

AL	Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
JOE	Little late for that.

JOE	Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
AL	You eat it.
JOE	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
AL	I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.

JOE	Now what?
AL	The sand.
JOE	Eat it?
AL	Eat it.
JOE	I don't want to eat it.
AL	Why not?
JOE	It's sand.
AL	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!

AL	Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
JOE	Where are you going? Wait!

JOE	Al, are you doing anything in there?
AL	What? What do you mean?
JOE	Are you screwing with any nerves?

JOE	Beautiful!
AL	What was?
JOE	A girl.

JOE	This must be business, there's nothing else here.
AL	Follow it.

JOE	She's...pretty fast.
AL	You're out of shape.

AL	What is it?
JOE	She's beautiful...! What do I do?

JOE	You're beautiful..
AL	What's happening?
JOE	She doesn't seem to understand.
AL	Try another language.
JOE	Which language?
AL	How should I know?

JOE	Help me out, will you?
AL	What can I do? You're on your own.

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Don't just stand there, say something.
JOE	What?
AL	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.

AL	.
JOE	.

AL	Wait.
JOE	Wait.

AL	Where is she staying?
JOE	Where are you staying?

AL	Touch her.
JOE	What?
AL	Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.

JOE	...Joe.
AL	No...you idiot!

AL	What happened?
JOE	...Rene...

AL	Where are you going?
JOE	To the hotel. To register.
AL	Without your pants.
JOE	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.

AL	Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
JOE	Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
AL	It worked.
JOE	I made it work.
AL	You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
JOE	Rene...
JOE	I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
AL	Well you did it today.
JOE	Yeah. I did it.
AL	But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.

JOE	Now, where would I be?
AL	What are you looking at?

AL	But what's it look like?
JOE	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
AL	Is something glinting?

JOE	What is it?
AL	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!

AL	You really like that shirt?
JOE	This...is not going to work out.

AL	Much too blue.
JOE	Not blue enough.

JOE	Mind your own business.
AL	It is my business. It's my name.
JOE	But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.

AL	Not that tie with that coat.
JOE	Why not?!

AL	What did that cost?
JOE	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
AL	Doesn't.

AL	Which one is she?
JOE	The beautiful one.

AL	They both look good to me.
JOE	You have no taste.

AL	Get close to them.
JOE	That place. By the window.

AL	You're not just after this girl, are you?
JOE	Who, me?

JOE	You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
AL	Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
JOE	That's a big if.

AL	Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
JOE	What glasses.
AL	The drinks...Stay on them.

AL	Follow that busboy.
JOE	Are you serious?

JOE	I feel like an idiot.
AL	Just hold them close and stay still.

JOE	Which one?
AL	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
JOE	Killer!

AL	Just don't show fear.
JOE	I don't know what's going on.
AL	It lends you an air of mystery.

AL	He recognises you, throw him off.
JOE	My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
AL	Don't get too cute.

AL	Joe, be careful!
JOE	...I've lost something. I must get it back.

AL	They're all in it.
JOE	How do you know?
AL	Voice stress analyzer.
JOE	Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.

JOE	Even Rene?
AL	She's the toughest to read.
JOE	Maybe she's telling the truth.
AL	Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
JOE	Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...

AL	What is it, your charm?
JOE	This just won't work.
AL	You're doing great with her.
JOE	Not her. You!
AL	What is it?
JOE	You can't listen. You can't watch either.

JOE	It's embarrassing.
AL	What if she says something important?
JOE	I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
AL	What am I supposed to do?
JOE	You got any books in there?
AL	Oh come on.
JOE	You shut down your sensors.
AL	Joe! It's 56 hours!
JOE	I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.

AL	What Happened?
JOE	I don't know!
AL	What she say. What'd you get out of her?

JOE	Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
AL	Is that all?
JOE	Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.

JOE	She's got the most beautiful...s
AL	Shit! You're in love.

AL	And on my time.
JOE	It's not your time. I get time off.
AL	You get time off to sleep.

JOE	No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
JOE	No. What will you do.
AL	I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!

AL	You been had. We have.
JOE	It wasn't like that.

AL	Some agent you are.
JOE	Why don't you get out of my face.

AL	Bingo.
JOE	You found her.
AL	Better. I found Ryuji.
JOE	That's good. It's not better. Where?
AL	Osaka.
JOE	Osaka?
AL	Fountainhead of High-Tech.

JOE	Don't you think I stand out like this.
AL	We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
JOE	I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Follow her.
JOE	On what?
AL	Run, stupid!

AL	Come on, she's getting away.
JOE	I can't keep up.

JOE	Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
AL	That's not funny.

JOE	Sapporo..
AL	Just stay here and rest.
JOE	Where are you going?
AL	Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
JOE	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...

AL	`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
JOE	What do I do?
AL	Relax. Let me do this.

AL	Relax. Make your mind a blank.
JOE	It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.

AL	What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
JOE	You think. That's what you're good at.

AL	Yeah...You've fallen for her.
JOE	I told you, I have a feeling...
AL	One of your instincts?
JOE	I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.

AL	Don't touch a thing.
JOE	Don't worry!

AL	...drink it.
JOE	Too late.

JOE	What next!
AL	Drink lots of water.

JOE	I can't...
AL	You have to! Quickly!
JOE	...imagine a better grape for the region.

JOE	What are you doing?
AL	Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.

JOE	Ow!
AL	A hard left. A hard left.

AL	Door to the right. Get up and run.
JOE	I can't see a thing.
AL	Neither can they.

JOE	What?
AL	Never mind, just say it.

AL	He was with Gruner!
JOE	You were with GRUNER!

JOE	I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
AL	No. You can't trust her.

AL	Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
JOE	Probably.
AL	I don't trust her.
JOE	Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...

AL	It's him.
JOE	Come on.

AL	Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
AL	I've got an idea.
JOE	I was afraid of that.

JOE	You sure this will work?
AL	Not sure at all.
JOE	Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
AL	Just say the words. Just like I told you.

JOE	What was it? What'd I say?
AL	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

AL	haka xuki.
JOE	haka xuki. What's that mean?
AL	Cash.

AL	Left...The one with the red dot.
JOE	Well...?
AL	It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.

JOE	He hung us up dry.
AL	While he makes the run.
JOE	Where?

AL	It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
JOE	And Dieter?
AL	He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.

JOE	Then, why'd he lead us here.
AL	He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.

AL	Do it.
JOE	I can't handle that thing.
AL	Don't worry, I can.

AL	Are you alright?
JOE	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.

AL	Aim just in front of his face.
JOE	Aim what?

JOE	Holy...
AL	...Shit! It's just money.

JOE	He aready made the deal..
AL	The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
JOE	Dieter!
AL	GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

JOE	There's a lot you don't know.
AL	And don't let her know, either.

AL	This may hurt.
JOE	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?

JOE	Pretty advanced, isn't it?
AL	Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.

JOE	Do something.
AL	What exactly?
JOE	I don't know.

JOE	What happened?
AL	Losing power. The laser drained it.

AL	Be quiet.
JOE	Where've you been?
AL	Never mind that, where are we now.
JOE	We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
AL	Gimme a minute.
JOE	Looks like you can have all you want.

JOE	I can always flush you down the toilet.
AL	Keep thinking.
JOE	I have been... I think you're right.
AL	About what?
JOE	Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
AL	Rene?
JOE	She works for them.
AL	Now, you're too suspicious.
JOE	You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
AL	I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
JOE	No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.

AL	She is beautiful.
JOE	You've changed your mind.

AL	Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
AL	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
JOE	Oh no!

AL	I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
AL	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
JOE	They can?

AL	You're a lucky man.
JOE	Yeah, sure.

AL	She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE	You're lovely.

JOE	I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
AL	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE	I want to thank you for what you've done.

JOE	Awwww...
AL	I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.

AL	Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE	I'll get us out of here.
AL	Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....

AL	In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE	That's nice.

JOE	What are you doing?
AL	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.

OUTSIDE -	JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
AL	GO-TOE. It's some islands.
OUTSIDE -	JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
AL	It's all we've got.

OUTSIDE -	JOE What abilities...?
AL	Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.

AL	I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
OUTSIDE -	JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
AL	Some friend you are! You know what I hope?

AL	You just got a Mickey.
OUTSIDE -	RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.

AL	Not that truth!
RENE	Aren't we all.

AL	Sorry...
RENE	It'll remind me of you.
AL	Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.

AL	Doesn't matter.
RENE	What part what?
AL	The best part. She'll love it.

RENE	I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
AL	Do what? What'd you do?

RENE	What is your name?
AL	Don't give her your name.

AL	No!
RENE	Oh, I can't.
AL	Good.

AL	We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
RENE	Dieter?

AL	I'm against it.
RENE	I insist.

RENE	Can you fly this?
AL	Don't worry.

RENE	I'm...scared.
AL	Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.

RENE	I didn't do anything.
AL	I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.

RENE	Nice?
AL	In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.

AL	What kind of a deal?
RENE	Let us get to the border!
AL	Then what?

AL	I knew you were trouble.
RENE	Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.

RENE	What happened?
BURR	Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
RENE	In him?
BURR	It's a long story.
RENE	ya hyutn slulptsa?

BURR	They have stolen state property.
RENE	What a nerve!

DIETER	I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
BURR	Rene?
DIETER	She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.

BURR	Impossible.
DIETER	I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.

DIETER	If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
BURR	Who's our little man?
DIETER	Me.
BURR	No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
DIETER	I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.

BURR	You didn't tell us you were coming?
JOE	Then how did you know?

BURR	You've cut your hair?
JOE	I dyed it. We're all getting old.

JOE	PEM115!
BURR	**?!! 
JOE	Newer, more powerful design.

JOE	How about a deal?
BURR	We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.

COLIN	Surveillance Cameras?
FINNEGAN	They took the tapes.
COLIN	You have nothing...
FINNEGAN	We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?

COLIN	We'll have to let them go.
FINNEGAN	Surveilliance on them all.

FINNEGAN	Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
COLIN	He work for us?
FINNEGAN	Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.

FINNEGAN	What Job?
COLIN	Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
FINNEGAN	Sir?
COLIN	Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
FINNEGAN	Bit expensive, sir.
COLIN	It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.

DIETER	Who is your friend?
RENE	We met on the beach.
DIETER	Join us.

DIETER	What are you doing here, where've you been?
RENE	I have a new client.
DIETER	That crazy guy?
RENE	Yes. Joe.

DIETER	Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
RENE	It's just money.
DIETER	Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.

DIETER	Yes?
RENE	He's not an ordinary man.
DIETER	Enough ROmance.
RENE	He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!

JOE	I don't want to intrude.
DIETER	We insist.

JOE	Al Viola.
DIETER	That name's familiar.
JOE	It is to me too.
DIETER	You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?

JOE	...Foreign service.
DIETER	And how do you service foreigners.
JOE	Well...I try to give them whatever they want.

DIETER	What brings you here?
JOE	I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.

DIETER	And...you know Jan Gruner?
JOE	I think I've heard of you.

FINNEGAN	Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
JOE	What?
FINNEGAN	Your memory.
JOE	What about it?
FINNEGAN	It may have been affected.
JOE	Oh.
FINNEGAN	You may not remember things.
JOE	What things?
FINNEGAN	I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
JOE	Oh...that's okay.
FINNEGAN	When you do...
JOE	Do what?
FINNEGAN	When you remember...
JOE	Remember what?
FINNEGAN	Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
JOE	Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
FINNEGAN	Right.
JOE	Who...are you?
FINNEGAN	Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
JOE	How do I look?
FINNEGAN	Fine. You look fine.
JOE	Thanks.
FINNEGAN	Well...
JOE	Well what?
FINNEGAN	We're here.
JOE	Here?
FINNEGAN	Home. Your home. The address on your form.
JOE	Oh.
FINNEGAN	Don't you want to get out?
JOE	Oh....Sure.
FINNEGAN	Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
JOE	I feel fine.
FINNEGAN	You'll feel better
JOE	I will?
FINNEGAN	Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.

FINNEGAN	Joe.
JOE	What?
FINNEGAN	Take the card.
JOE	Oh yeah, thanks...

FINNEGAN	Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
JOE	No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
FINNEGAN	Why would we want to hurt you?
JOE	Not you. Them.
FINNEGAN	Who?
JOE	I don't know Who.

FINNEGAN	Al?
JOE	The little man in my...  ...head...

JOE	I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
FINNEGAN	Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.

JOE	Ahhh...nothing.
FINNEGAN	Been complaning of hallucinations.
JOE	Not...complaining, actually.
FINNEGAN	Been hearing voices.

FINNEGAN	Was quite excited, when he came in...
JOE	Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...

FINNEGAN	Sue who?
JOE	You...him...UST.

JOE	That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
GRUNER	I noticed you staring.
JOE	Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?

GRUNER	And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
JOE	A little voice in my head.

GRUNER	You may you find all the solitude you want.
JOE	Thanks, I appreciate that.

JOE	Don't do it!
GRUNER	Just give me the keys.
JOE	Whatever it is, don't do it.

JOE	How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
WAITER	Sir?

JOE	How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
WAITER	We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
JOE	This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.

JOE	Now you know what I know.
WAITER	Sir?

JOE	About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
WAITER	Ahhh. Good choice, sir.

JOE	The fresh tuna?..
WAITER	Yessir...very good sir.

JOE	Yes...What is it?
WOMAN	What's what?
JOE	What do you want?
WOMAN	Nothing.
JOE	What did you say?
WOMAN	Nothing.
JOE	What?
WOMAN	I said...I didn't say..anything!
JOE	Then who did?
WOMAN	You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.

JOE	Oh...and who is it!?
WOMAN	I didn't say anything.

RENE	What do you do about what?
JOE	...I'm looking for someone.

RENE	Is someone else here?
JOE	No. No one to speak of.
RENE	I am confused. Or maybe it's you.

JOE	...Blake
RENE	Blake?
JOE	The poet...something he said...
RENE	Yes?

RENE	Blake said that?
JOE	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.

JOE	I'll be right there.
RENE	Where?
JOE	Dinner...tonight.
RENE	Oh...I can't. Business.

RENE	And you.
JOE	...right here too.
RENE	Haven't seen you around.

JOE	I can't do that?
RENE	Do what?
JOE	Let you leave without it.
RENE	Without what?

JOE	What's so funny?
RENE	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
JOE	What way?
RENE	Like there's someone else here.

JOE	Wait. What's your name?
RENE	...Rene.

RENE	You mean from it.
JOE	Yes, of course.

JOE	And you?
RENE	I just work for the travel firm.

RENE	You again.
JOE	Me still. They left you alone?
RENE	I waited for you.
JOE	Why?
RENE	...I...don't know.

RENE	I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
JOE	It's not apparent.
RENE	...and sort of...disinterest.
JOE	Disinterest?
RENE	As if your mind's not all there.
JOE	I am sort of scattered.
RENE	Can I help?
JOE	You are.
RENE	Are you alright?

JOE	Promise you what?
RENE	That you're not crazy.
JOE	I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
RENE	You talk to yourself.
JOE	But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
RENE	Why do you do it?
JOE	If I was with you, I wouldn't
RENE	You did.
JOE	That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
RENE	You're talking to me.
JOE	And how'm I doing?
RENE	You're doing...Okay.
JOE	Just Okay...

RENE	...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
JOE	...Naw. Made that up.
RENE	Who do you work for?
JOE	No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
RENE	Trans Ocean Travel.
JOE	Is that Ryuji?
RENE	No. Ryuji just hires us.
JOE	Hires you for what?
RENE	To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
JOE	How often they come here?
RENE	He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
JOE	And you, what do you like?
RENE	That depends...

RENE	Joe! What happened to you?
JOE	Why'd you run off?

JOE	Why did you leave?
RENE	They left. I had to go with them.
JOE	Why didn't you tell me?

JOE	Why did you stay with me?
RENE	Wanted to get to know you.
JOE	Why?
RENE	You seemed interesting.
JOE	Who else is interested in me?
RENE	What do you mean?
JOE	Your friends, did they ask about me?
RENE	They kidded me a little.
JOE	What did you tell them?
RENE	There's not much to tell.
JOE	Why did they leave?
RENE	I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
JOE	You work for Ryuji?
RENE	Sometimes. I told you I did.
JOE	Were you working for him last night?
RENE	Last night?
JOE	Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
RENE	No, he didn't do that.
JOE	He didn't.
RENE	No.
JOE	Who did?
RENE	You did.

RENE	I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
JOE	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.

RENE	You're leaving.
JOE	Food doesn't agree with me.
RENE	I'm leaving too.
JOE	Why?
RENE	This business is over.
JOE	I'm sorry. What will you do?
RENE	Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
JOE	I'm just on vacation.
RENE	Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?

JOE	You know where he went?
RENE	What's he done?
JOE	He stole something. From a friend of mine.
RENE	He must be a good friend.
JOE	We're very close.
RENE	What'd he steal?
JOE	A chip. Goes in a computer.
RENE	One chip?
JOE	The most important one. Can you help me find him?
RENE	How do you know you can trust me?
JOE	Got to trust someone.

RENE	I don't know. He mentioned a city.
JOE	What is it?
RENE	Hiroshima.
JOE	Get your things.

JOE	You don't believe me.
RENE	Oh sure.
JOE	Then why are you smiling like that?
RENE	Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
JOE	You think I'm like that?

JOE	What's Gruner like?
RENE	They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
JOE	Who was?
RENE	Ryuji and Gruner.
JOE	And Dieter.
RENE	Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
JOE	And you?
RENE	It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.

RENE	Where we going?
JOE	Beats me.

RENE	This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
JOE	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
RENE	Then where's the chip.

RENE	What?
JOE	He plays it all the time.

RENE	Now what?
JOE	We figure out if it's in here.
RENE	How?
JOE	Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.

RENE	That must be him. Water taxi.
JOE	Get us one.
RENE	Too late, they won't come back out till morning.

RENE	Where what?
JOE	Where would you go to sell a chip?

JOE	If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
RENE	Hong Kong.
JOE	What?
RENE	Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.

JOE	Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
RENE	I asked him.
JOE	Oh.

JOE	Why'd you ask him.
RENE	He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
JOE	Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.

RENE	What?
JOE	I said just relax. I'm in full control.

RENE	Chiang Cho?
JOE	...across THE BORDER. Come on!
RENE	That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
JOE	You've  been there?
RENE	I know the territory.
JOE	You coming along?

JOE	So do I.
RENE	This going to work?
JOE	Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
RENE	He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.

JOE	Why not?
RENE	Can you?
JOE	Sure I can, can't I?

RENE	What happened?
JOE	I can't fly it.
RENE	What'd...you forget?

JOE	Are you alright?
RENE	Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
JOE	Looks like they can. What did they do?
RENE	They asked about you.
JOE	What did you tell them?
RENE	That I really don't know.
JOE	Now what?
RENE	They'll listen to what we say in here.

RENE	What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
JOE	Why?

JOE	What a mess.
RENE	You can say that again. What do we do?
JOE	Nothing we can do.

RENE	What?
JOE	They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
RENE	Can't you do something?

JOE	I'm sorry I got you into this.
RENE	It was my choice.

RENE	Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
JOE	Why did you, then?
RENE	For you.

RENE	I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
JOE	I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.

RENE	How?
JOE	What?

JOE	Now what?
RENE	I've never met anyone like you.

JOE	Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
RENE	I love you too.

JOE	Don't worry.
RENE	Why not, what are you going to do?
JOE	Escape.

RENE	Just like that?
JOE	I'll come back for you.
RENE	Aren't you a little optimistic?

JOE	You son of a bitch! You conned me!
RENE	You're gonna laugh.

RENE	Kiss her you fool.
JOE	Her?

JOE	Who are you? Who do you work for?
RENE	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
JOE	I knew it. I told him.
RENE	Now what?
JOE	We just don't stop.

JOE	He can't help us.
RENE	Do something!
JOE	Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
RENE	You are, I've seen you.
JOE	It wasn't me. It was him.
RENE	It was you.
JOE	He told me what to do.
RENE	But you did it. It was you.

JOE	It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
RENE	If he was able, what would he say.

JOE	Come on.
RENE	That's twenty feet high.
JOE	Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.

JOE	Riuji?
RENE	I told you, I work for him.

RENE	What is it?
JOE	We're not moving fast enough for him.

RENE	He wants to apologise.
RENE	He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
JOE	Yeah...I have to get away.
RENE	I know a nice island.

RYUJI	Must be a fulfilling occupation.
JOE	It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.

RYUJI	What could you find in this place?
JOE	...Piece of mind.

RYUJI	Excuse me?
JOE	Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?

RYUJI	I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
JOE	Why are you on to him?
RYUJI	We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
JOE	Why'd you invite me here?
RYUJI	Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
JOE	What about the others.
RYUJI	I don't know.

JOE	Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
RECEPTIONIST.	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
JOE	I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
RECEPTIONIST.	...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?

RECEPTIONIST.	Is there anything else?
JOE	A drink...
RECEPTIONIST.	Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
JOE	Thanks.

TECH 3	Wait.
LEADER	Why?
TECH 3	You can't take that.
LEADER	Why not?
TECH 3	The experiment. The danger...

LEADER	It's alright.
TECH 3	It is?
LEADER	It will be fine. You have another.
TECH 3	Just one. The back up.
LEADER	Could I have it, please.

TECH 2	Poor bastard.

TECH 2	What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
TECH 3	What does he know?
TECH 2	Too much.

TECH 3	Look, nobody knows we did it.
TECH 2	Whoever took it does.

TECH 3	It'l take months.
TECH 2	So we better get started.
TECH 3	What about Al...

LOGAN	I'm a Sandman!
BILLY	I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
LOGAN	I feel sorry for you, boy!

BILLY	For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
LOGAN	No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

LOGAN	Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
BILLY	Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
LOGAN	No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
BILLY	Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

BOX	Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
LOGAN	All right -- what are you?
BOX	Your turn.

LOGAN	We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
BOX	Anything to eat?

LOGAN	How do you think we got here??!!
BOX	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?

LOGAN	Where do you think we came from?
BOX	From? From? From?
LOGAN	We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?

BOX	Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
LOGAN	Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!

BOX	Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
LOGAN	You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
BOX	Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
LOGAN	Where do you send them?
BOX	You're a beautiful pair.

LOGAN	Answer the question!
BOX	Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
LOGAN	There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
BOX	Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
LOGAN	That's better.  How do you want us?
BOX	Nude. Imagine, a pair.
LOGAN	It'll be all right...

LOGAN	How do you want us?
BOX	Up there.

LOGAN	All right. Now you keep your bargain.
BOX	Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
LOGAN	We're ready.

LOGAN	How did they get in here?
BOX	Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
LOGAN	What other food?
BOX	Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.

DOC	It's a real privilege, Sandman.
LOGAN	Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
DOC	I am.
LOGAN	Your own work?
DOC	And I did it myself right on there.

DOC	I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
LOGAN	Just the face.
DOC	Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.

DOC	Do you have anything special in mind?
LOGAN	I don't care... Just get it over with.
DOC	Hurry... hurry... hurry.

FRANCIS	You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
LOGAN	Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!

FRANCIS	You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
LOGAN	Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
FRANCIS	Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.

FRANCIS	Had enough?
LOGAN	Even the alarm didn't wake him.

FRANCIS	You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
LOGAN	Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
FRANCIS	Not in my time...

FRANCIS	Why?
LOGAN	Just wondered... what happens?
FRANCIS	Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?

LOGAN	But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
FRANCIS	Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
LOGAN	No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
FRANCIS	Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.

LOGAN	Did you ever see Francis-8?
FRANCIS	I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?

FRANCIS	I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
LOGAN	Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 

FRANCIS	You missed something special.
LOGAN	Well... you can't have them all.

FRANCIS	The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
LOGAN	What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.

LOGAN	You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
FRANCIS	Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...

LOGAN	Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
FRANCIS	Only a few? You're just not trying.

LOGAN	Who invited you?
FRANCIS	I'm in my party mood.

LOGAN	That was a great shot you made.
FRANCIS	Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?

LOGAN	I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
FRANCIS	You? Why? You're already beautiful.
LOGAN	No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.

FRANCIS	What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN	Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS	I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
LOGAN	Did you?
FRANCIS	Of course.
LOGAN	Anybody we know?
FRANCIS	Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
LOGAN	I'm fine...  See you...
FRANCIS	At Carousel tonight?

FRANCIS	What's going on, Logan?!
LOGAN	It has nothing to do with you.
FRANCIS	What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

FRANCIS	Why did you do that??!!
LOGAN	I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
FRANCIS	Why did you do that???!!!

HOLLY	It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
JESSICA	No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
HOLLY	He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
JESSICA	Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --

HOLLY	That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
JESSICA	...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
HOLLY	Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!

JESSICA	What's your name?
MARY	I'm Mary 2.
JESSICA	Where do you live, Mary?
MARY	Here.
JESSICA	Why aren't you in Nursery?
MARY	I'm very smart.
JESSICA	When do you go up?
MARY	I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.

LOGAN	What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA	Please... No.

LOGAN	Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
JESSICA	No.  Just no.
LOGAN	You prefer women?
JESSICA	No.
LOGAN	Well then...?
JESSICA	Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN	Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA	A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN	Yes... probably he was renewed?
JESSICA	He was killed.
LOGAN	Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA	Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
LOGAN	I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
JESSICA	Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
LOGAN	You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA	Jessica.
LOGAN	You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA	No.
LOGAN	Later.
JESSICA	No.
LOGAN	But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA	I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN	And?
JESSICA	I changed my mind.
LOGAN	And now?
JESSICA	Curious.
LOGAN	About what?
JESSICA	How a Sandman lives.

LOGAN	Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
JESSICA	Not about that.
LOGAN	I'm listening.
JESSICA	I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN	I'm not armed.  Well?
JESSICA	Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN	You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
JESSICA	I suppose. But what if you want to live?
LOGAN	So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.

LOGAN	But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
JESSICA	I didn't say that I would run... I just...
LOGAN	Are you a 5 or a 6? 
JESSICA	Six. I go red next year.
LOGAN	You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?

LOGAN	What Quad do you live in?
JESSICA	K.
LOGAN	You're sure you don't want to try?

JESSICA	You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA	Here I am.  Shall I come in?

LOGAN	I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN	Maybe... sure...
JESSICA	Thanks... but I have the choice.
LOGAN	Of course.
JESSICA	Then it's still no.

JESSICA	You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN	You know.
JESSICA	I don't believe you. There has to be more.
LOGAN	All right.

JESSICA	Why show me?
LOGAN	I'm going to run.
JESSICA	Why tell me?
LOGAN	You know something.
JESSICA	About running, dying what?
LOGAN	Both... running's what I'm interested in.
JESSICA	I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN	It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA	How can I?

JESSICA	Where did you get that?
LOGAN	A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA	And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN	I let him go... believe me.
JESSICA	I don't..
LOGAN	Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
JESSICA	Please? What friends?
LOGAN	I don't have much time.
JESSICA	I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
LOGAN	And I never heard of Sanctuary.

LOGAN	Are you here to help me?
JESSICA	What do you need?

JESSICA	What're you going to do?
LOGAN	That's tomorrow.
JESSICA	I wish I could help you.
LOGAN	Maybe you'll think of something...
JESSICA	I wish I knew what you think I know.

LOGAN	If you did know, you'd tell me.
JESSICA	Of course --
LOGAN	If you trusted me, you'd know.
JESSICA	We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?

LOGAN	A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
JESSICA	You're not going, are you?
LOGAN	Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.

JESSICA	I'd rather be with you.
LOGAN	That's nice.

LOGAN	They're like beasts. Wild.
JESSICA	Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
LOGAN	Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
JESSICA	Some people say children need human mothering.
LOGAN	Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
JESSICA	I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
LOGAN	Uh-uh.
JESSICA	I have.
LOGAN	When did you begin to question Lastday?
JESSICA	I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
LOGAN	Let's see -- how long has it been?

LOGAN	Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
JESSICA	But what is this -- why?
LOGAN	The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
JESSICA	Muscle? I don't know that one.

JESSICA	I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
LOGAN	Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
JESSICA	Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
LOGAN	All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
JESSICA	Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
LOGAN	That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
JESSICA	I -- I can't.
LOGAN	Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
JESSICA	No. Not that either.

LOGAN	Are you taking me to them?
JESSICA	Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
LOGAN	Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
JESSICA	He's good, isn't he?
LOGAN	Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
JESSICA	They won't believe us.
LOGAN	I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
JESSICA	They won't listen.
LOGAN	You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
JESSICA	We'll convince them.

JESSICA	Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
LOGAN	How will they know we're coming?
JESSICA	They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.

JESSICA	Will you take me with you?
LOGAN	Why, Jessica? You're still a green.

JESSICA	How do we know this is the right way?
LOGAN	It's the only way.

JESSICA	What do you suppose this was...?
LOGAN	Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
JESSICA	Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.

JESSICA	I'm afraid.
LOGAN	It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.

JESSICA	I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
LOGAN	It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA	You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN	You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
JESSICA	I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
LOGAN	I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA	Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
LOGAN	I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
JESSICA	For us.

JESSICA	What's that?
LOGAN	It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
JESSICA	And yours.

JESSICA	I hate outside! I hate it!
LOGAN	We'll be all right...  We will...

JESSICA	Don't!
LOGAN	Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.

JESSICA	It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
LOGAN	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.

JESSICA	Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
LOGAN	I doubt it.
JESSICA	Don't ever let go.
LOGAN	I won't.

LOGAN	It all seemed to make sense until Box.
JESSICA	Do you think he was telling the Truth?

JESSICA	Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
LOGAN	How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.

LOGAN	You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
JESSICA	Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?

JESSICA	What does it mean?
LOGAN	The Lifeclocks have no power outside.

JESSICA	You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN	You know, Jessica.
JESSICA	...But I still have the choice...?
LOGAN	Of course.
JESSICA	Then the answer's yes...

LOGAN	I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
JESSICA	Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?

LOGAN	They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
JESSICA	Beloved Husband. "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?

JESSICA	Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
LOGAN	It could be...

LOGAN	That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
JESSICA	He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
LOGAN	One in a million, I suppose

JESSICA	There's a Sanctuary... there is!
LOGAN	You want there to be one... that doesn't...
JESSICA	There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
LOGAN	No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
JESSICA	You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!

LOGAN	What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
JESSICA	He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
LOGAN	We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA	To what?
LOGAN	I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
JESSICA	You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN	Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
JESSICA	Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
LOGAN	Things change!
JESSICA	You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!

LOGAN	Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
JESSICA	I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.

JESSICA	Beloved son...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
LOGAN	Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
JESSICA	And Sanctuary?
LOGAN	Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...

JESSICA	Beloved husband...
LOGAN	Beloved wife...

JESSICA	What does that water do?
LOGAN	It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
JESSICA	Is it inside the city?
LOGAN	Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.

OLD MAN	Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
JESSICA	But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
OLD MAN	Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?

JESSICA	And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
OLD MAN	Yes...
JESSICA	Are you sure?
OLD MAN	Mother and Father said so... you know?

OLD MAN	What kind of jewel is this?
JESSICA	I don't know.
OLD MAN	You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
JESSICA	No.
OLD MAN	Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.

JESSICA	What belongs to the people?
OLD MAN	All this. All of it.
JESSICA	What people?
OLD MAN	I don't know... but it does.

OLD MAN	We'll have to bury him.
JESSICA	What's that?
OLD MAN	They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...

OLD MAN	I'll make the arrangements.
JESSICA	At least it's over...

OLD MAN	Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA	We'll remember. But that's a long time off...

JESSICA	Come with us.
OLD MAN	Where are you going?

JESSICA	Goodbye.
OLD MAN	Oh, my...

RECEPTIONIST	Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN	Hello.
RECEPTIONIST	Do you want to see Doc?

RECEPTIONIST	We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
LOGAN	A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
RECEPTIONIST	I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
LOGAN	It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST	My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN	No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.

LOGAN	How long have you been living here?
OLD MAN	For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN	What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN	Just a place, I suppose... who knows?

LOGAN	How did you get here?
OLD MAN	I have always been here...
LOGAN	Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN	Gracious... no.
LOGAN	Have any other people ever passed through?

OLD MAN	But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN	What makes you think so?
OLD MAN	My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
LOGAN	Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?

LOGAN	Where are they?
OLD MAN	Dead... they're dead... and buried.

OLD MAN	They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
LOGAN	No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
OLD MAN	It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
LOGAN	I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.

LOGAN	What's beyond this place -- do you know?
OLD MAN	No, no, no
LOGAN	Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
OLD MAN	Never, never, ever. Nothing.

LOGAN	May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
OLD MAN	Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.

OLD MAN	Are you ready to put him in?
LOGAN	Not yet.
OLD MAN	All right.

LOGAN	We're leaving.
OLD MAN	What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.

LOGAN	To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
OLD MAN	Alive?

OLD MAN	Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
LOGAN	More... many more.
OLD MAN	And all alive you say?

OLD MAN	Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
LOGAN	I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.

OLD MAN	That's better than gold when it's cold.
LOGAN	Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
OLD MAN	My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
LOGAN	Stay? They lived together all their years?
OLD MAN	Oh, yes... I think...

LOGAN	I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
OLD MAN	Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
LOGAN	I'm sorry.
OLD MAN	Yes...
LOGAN	Can you make it back?
OLD MAN	Oh my... I'll try.

VOICE	Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
LOGAN	Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
VOICE	Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

LOGAN	I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
VOICE	It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN	Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?

VOICE	Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
LOGAN	No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

MAN	Well? How do you like it?
WOMAN	I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
MAN	Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
WOMAN	Too little.
MAN	Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.

MAN	No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
WOMAN	You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?

KAY	The hell happened?
COWAN	Hesitated, sir.
KAY	I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.

KAY	You shot an eight year old girl.
COWAN	Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
KAY	The hell were you thinking?
COWAN	Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
KAY	Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.

COWAN	Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
KAY	Cowan--
COWAN	Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
KAY	Cowan--
COWAN	of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
KAY	Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?

COWAN	Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
KAY	It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.

COWAN	So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
KAY	It's not even a fucking door.

KAY	...touch that.
COWAN	What the hell...
KAY	Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
COWAN	I guess I lost:
KAY	You got smeared.

KAY	We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
COWAN	And Goodwill Toward Man?
KAY	No. just peace on Earth.
COWAN	I gotta be honest about something.

COWAN	Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
KAY	Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.

KAY	It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
COWAN	And if I say yes?
KAY	Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.

COWAN	... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
ZED	Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
COWAN	They don't?
ZED	They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.

ZED	What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
COWAN	I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.

COWAN	Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
ZED	For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
COWAN	Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
ZED	We're the government, Cowan.

ZED	You think we're nuts.
COWAN	No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
ZED	Mrs. Edelson?

ZED	Only the damn guy won't know it.
COWAN	What happens if I say no?

ZED	From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
COWAN	Yes, sir.

ZED	Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
COWAN	Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

ZED	Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
COWAN	Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
ZED	Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.

COWAN	So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
ZED	His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
COWAN	It'll make sense later?
ZED	No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.

WALLACE	Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
COWAN	Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
WALLACE	Actually, it didn't come from me.

COWAN	Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
WALLACE	Well this didn't.
COWAN	Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--

WALLACE	Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
COWAN	Actually, sir--
WALLACE	Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
COWAN	All the time, sir.
WALLACE	You do?
COWAN	Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

KAY	Which do you have your money on, Dee?
DEE	I'd go with number three.
KAY	Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?

KAY	Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
DEE	Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
KAY	What?  I thought you just--

KAY	Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
DEE	Kay, I'm sorry...
KAY	Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.

DEE	Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
KAY	Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

KAY	I wasn't scared...
DEE	Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...

KAY	Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
DEE	Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
KAY	Don't worry about it.

DEE	Helluva night, isn't it?
KAY	Yup.  Sure is.

DEE	'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
KAY	Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
DEE	Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?

KAY	Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
DEE	Kay...

KAY	We'll take it from here.
INS LEADER	What?  Who the hell are you?
KAY	INS, Washington.  Special services.

KAY	Vayanse. You others, go on.
INS LEADER	Sir--
KAY	Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
INS LEADER	Sir, you can't just--
KAY	DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

KAY	This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
INS LEADER	Why?  What are you gonna do?
KAY	Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.

KAY	Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
INS LEADER	What?
KAY	You heard me.  You two, especially.

JAY	Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
KAY	We wear black.
JAY	Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?

KAY	The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
JAY	I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.

JAY	It's a bug.
KAY	Right.
JAY	But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.

JAY	So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
KAY	So what's the problem?
JAY	Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...

JAY	I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
KAY	It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
JAY	I know, but we're on a college campus...
KAY	This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.

JAY	I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
KAY	Keep her out of here while I check it out.
JAY	I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..

JAY	I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
KAY	She didn't even know you. .
JAY	I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
KAY	Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
JAY	Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
KAY	Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
JAY	I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
KAY	If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
JAY	I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
KAY	You don't know the half of it.
JAY	What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
KAY	I taught kindergarten.
JAY	Ha ha.  No, really.
KAY	It was a long time ago.-

JAY	Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
KAY	Why?
JAY	Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
KAY	You don't know me at all.
JAY	Um-- Kay?

JAY	Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
KAY	Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.

JAY	What?
KAY	Something seem unusual to you about that?
JAY	Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
KAY	If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
JAY	I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
KAY	Let's check am out.

JAY	what's this?
KAY	It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.

KAY	Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
JAY	I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
KAY	Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
JAY	A what?

JAY	Now what?
KAY	History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.

KAY	A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
JAY	Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
KAY	Hold it.

KAY	He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
JAY	There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
KAY	There's a god damn good reason.

KAY	Something's wrong here.
JAY	Gee.  You really think?
KAY	Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
JAY	I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
KAY	Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
JAY	And what's this ... ?
KAY	What?

JAY	Looks like a train ticket.
KAY	Where to?

JAY	What's going on, Kay?
KAY	I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
JAY	The radio show?
KAY	No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
JAY	You think that's what's-happening?
KAY	I think that's what's happening...

KAY	Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
JAY	That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?

JAY	Jesus...
KAY	Get back in the car!

JAY	Jesus Christ...
KAY	We're rising.

KAY	Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
JAY	The Pentagon.

KAY	Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs...
JAY	I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.

KAY	Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
JAY	What if he's telling the truth?
KAY	You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.

JAY	Kay--
KAY	Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?

KAY	He's here to help!?
JAY	Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
KAY	How does that help me?
JAY	Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.

KAY	Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
JAY	Kay.  All I'm saying--
KAY	I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
JAY	I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
KAY	Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
JAY	That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.

JAY	What are you doing?
KAY	Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?

JAY	Since how long?
KAY	Since as long as we've been keeping records...

KAY	Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
JAY	For how long?

KAY	We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
JAY	Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?

KAY	It's marble.
JAY	All of it?

JAY	Would you call this a code 100?
KAY	I'd double it and add 20.

KAY	I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
JAY	Do his job.
KAY	Right.  Oh, and here.

JAY	Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
KAY	Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
JAY	in case I need it?
KAY	In case I need it.

KAY	Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
JAY	Kay!?

KAY	You were saying?
JAY	Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

JAY	After I got the shit beat out of me!
KAY	And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
JAY	You coulda told me what you were doing.
KAY	There wasn't time, sport!

JAY	Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
KAY	Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
JAY	Kay, you're scaring your partner.
KAY	I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
JAY	Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

JAY	I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
ZED	Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
JAY	Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?

ZED	Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
JAY	You know, there's something we never really thought of...

JAY	Sure.
ZED	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.

ZED	I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
JAY	Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?

JAY	So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
LAUREL	Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?

LAUREL	Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
JAY	I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.

LAUREL	So... how'd you hear about this?
JAY	Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
LAUREL	Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.

JAY	Right, right-- I like that stuff.
LAUREL	With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
JAY	Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
LAUREL	Do have any idea what I just said?

LAUREL	Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
JAY	Actually, you may have.

LAUREL	It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
JAY	I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
LAUREL	I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
JAY	Why not?
LAUREL	Well, first of all, it's entomologist.

LAUREL	I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
JAY	What is it?
LAUREL	It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
JAY	But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
LAUREL	Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.

JAY	When?
LAUREL	It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
JAY	So... how did they get here?

LAUREL	What do we do?
JAY	What do we do?    Lean into it.
LAUREL	What the hell does that mean?
JAY	Actually... I don't know.

JAY	Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
LAUREL	Out of focus?

JAY	Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
LAUREL	The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
JAY	What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
LAUREL	Are you sure you don't?

LAUREL	What are you doing?
JAY	They respond to fear, right?
LAUREL	Yeah ... ?
JAY	Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.

KAY	What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
JEEBS	No.
KAY	Maybe you need a closer look.

JEEBS	The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
KAY	You figured what?
JEEBS	I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.

KAY	Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
JEEBS	I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?

KAY	And I'm arranging deportation papers.
JEEBS	Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
KAY	And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--

KAY	Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
JEEBS	You're not taking me in!

KAY	Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
YAZ	How could it not?
KAY	Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
YAZ	Come on now.  People are smart.
KAY	No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.

KAY	Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
YAZ	Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

KAY	Goodwill...
YAZ	Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.

MIKEY	Nowhere.
KAY	Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.

MIKEY	Er. well, nowhere special.
KAY	I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
MIKEY	Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.

KAY	Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
MIKEY	I dunno. One?
KAY	Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
MIKEY	It's... coming.
KAY	What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?

KAY	So... now what?  Cattle call again?
KAY	Yeah, I'll talk to you.

KAY	... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
ZED'S VOICE	Nothing.
KAY	Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
ZED'S VOICE	Nope.  Nothing at all.

KAY	I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
ZED'S VOICE	Yeah, Kay?
KAY	Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
ZED'S VOICE	Noon exactly.
KAY	Did he say where?
ZED'S VOICE	Actually, yeah--
KAY	Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
ZED'S VOICE	How'd you know that?  Kay?
KAY	Cause I think we're looking at it.

KAY	Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
LEONARD	They're not my pals--
KAY	They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
LEONARD	What if I don't?
KAY	In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
LEONARD	Will it lower the curve?
KAY	I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
LEONARD	I wanna make a deal.

LEONARD	Found it.
KAY	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
LEONARD	I promised I wouldn't tell.

LEONARD	I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
KAY	This guy.  Where was he?

KAY	We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
LAUREL	Scientific American?  Really?

KAY	This it?
LAUREL	Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

LAUREL	I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
KAY	May I have a look?

KAY	We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
LAUREL	Come again?

LAUREL	Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
KAY	But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.

KAY	We need to talk to you about the alien.
LAUREL	The what?

KAY	Which way?
LAUREL	Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.

LAUREL	Really nice wheels, by the way.
KAY	Wait-- listen--

ZED	How's Dee?
KAY	Fine.  Good.

KAY	Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
ZED	So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?

ZED	Kay?  What's your 20?
KAY	Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
ZED	I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
KAY	What the hell is going on?

ZED	He's gone, too.
KAY	What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
ZED	Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.

ZED	Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
KAY	Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
ZED	Hard to tell.  I hope not.
KAY	Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.

ZED	They're gone.
KAY	Dee?  What are you doing here?

KAY	I'm getting a trajectory...
ZED	What do we have?  Are we showing anything?

KAY	And they're buying it?
ZED	They went right to the President.
KAY	They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?

ZED	As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
KAY	Where's he making his big speech?
ZED	They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.

ZED	Well, it wasn't in the jar...
KAY	Did it leave?
ZED	Actually, I don't know...
KAY	Oh shit!

KAY	Yeah?  What's up?
ZED	I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.

ZED	And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
KAY	Don't tell me.  Insects.

ZED	How'd you know?
KAY	Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.

YAZ	Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
PRESIDENT	Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
YAZ	That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.

YAZ	Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
PRESIDENT	If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
YAZ	A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
PRESIDENT	And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
YAZ	That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.

ARDETH RAY	I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
O'CONNELL	Relax, I got him.
ARDETH RAY	No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
O'CONNELL	Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?

O'CONNELL	You know where he's taking her?
ARDETH RAY	Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.

O'CONNELL	Who the hell are these guys?
ARDETH RAY	Priests. Imhotep's priests.

O'CONNELL	I never killed a priest before.
ARDETH RAY	They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
O'CONNELL	Well, okay then.

ARDETH RAY	We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
JONATHAN	You're not going to kill us?

JONATHAN	And what ritual would that be?
ARDETH RAY	The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
JONATHAN	And how does one do that?
ARDETH RAY	By reading the Book Of The Dead.
JONATHAN	Oh yes, of course.
ARDETH RAY	And then killing your sister.
JONATHAN	Excuse me?

ARDETH RAY	If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
JONATHAN	Did you say 'kill' my sister?

BENI	Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
O'CONNELL	Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

O'CONNELL	Now go find me a big stick.
BENI	In the desert? What for?

O'CONNELL	How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
BENI	I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
O'CONNELL	Altar boys?
BENI	Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?

BENI	What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
O'CONNELL	None of the above, thank you.
BENI	Then what the hell are you doing here!?

BENI	My very good friend! What a surprise.
O'CONNELL	Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.

BENI	You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
O'CONNELL	So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
BENI	Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.

O'CONNELL	The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
BENI	You always did have more balls than brains.

O'CONNELL	Let's make us even, shall we?
BENI	Even?

BENI	O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
O'CONNELL	Sounds familiar.

BENI	Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
O'CONNELL	Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!

BENI	Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
O'CONNELL	I've had worse.

O'CONNELL	Goin' somewhere?
BENI	Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!

O'CONNELL	C'mon, friend.
BENI	Why do you like to fight so much?
O'CONNELL	'Cause I look good doin, it.

O'CONNELL	Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
BENI	You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
O'CONNELL	Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
BENI	This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
O'CONNELL	Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

BENI	The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
O'CONNELL	Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
BENI	He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
O'CONNELL	Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
BENI	Do you know where I can steal some?

O'CONNELL	Where's your new friend?
BENI	What friend? You're my only friend.

O'CONNELL	Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
BENI	It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
O'CONNELL	Immune from what?
BENI	You shall see.
O'CONNELL	What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.

BENI	The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
O'CONNELL	What does he want the book for?
BENI	Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.

BENI	Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
EVELYN	That's one way of putting it.

EVELYN	What just happened?
BENI	All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.

BENI	Yeah?
EVELYN	Oh yes, always.

BENI	...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
EVELYN	Intestines.
BENI	Yeah! Them.

EVELYN	I'm sorry, it was an accident.
CURATOR	When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?

EVELYN	You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
CURATOR	Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!

EVELYN	See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
CURATOR	Perhaps.

CURATOR	Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
EVELYN	What is he doing here?
CURATOR	Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?

EVELYN	And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
CURATOR	To have stopped this creature? Yes!

EVELYN	In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
CURATOR	It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

EVELYN	I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
CURATOR	-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
EVELYN	Exactly --

HOOK	She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
CURATOR	No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.

HOOK	The key!? She has the lost key!?
CURATOR	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
HOOK	Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
CURATOR	And burn the map and retrieve the key.
HOOK	It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
CURATOR	Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?

O'CONNELL	I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
CURATOR	You will not believe it.
O'CONNELL	Try me.

O'CONNELL	Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
CURATOR	According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.

O'CONNELL	So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
CURATOR	-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
O'CONNELL	You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
CURATOR	Correct, And that's when --

CURATOR	Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
O'CONNELL	Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
CURATOR	If we want to kill the creature, yes.

DANIELS	See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
HENDERSON	For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.

HENDERSON	I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
DANIELS	Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!

HENDERSON	The sun turning black.
DANIELS	Water turning to blood.

DANIELS	You bastards!
HENDERSON	What did you do to him!?

HENDERSON	The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
DANIELS	Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.

DANIELS	The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
HENDERSON	Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

EVELYN	And what is he in prison for?
WARDEN	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
EVELYN	And what did he say?
WARDEN	He said... he was just looking for a good time.

EVELYN	Where are they taking him?
WARDEN	To be hanged.

WARDEN	No women allowed.
EVELYN	I am an English woman.

EVELYN	I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
WARDEN	I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
EVELYN	Two hundred pounds.
WARDEN	Proceed!
EVELYN	Three hundred pounds!

WARDEN	You lie.
EVELYN	I would never!

WARDEN	Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
EVELYN	Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
WARDEN	Fifty percent.
EVELYN	Twenty.
WARDEN	Forty.

WARDEN	A bright good morning to all.
EVELYN	What are you doing here?
WARDEN	I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.

EVELYN	Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
WARDEN	Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

O'CONNELL	So who's the broad?
EVELYN	Broad?!

EVELYN	We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
O'CONNELL	No.
EVELYN	No?
O'CONNELL	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

EVELYN	How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
O'CONNELL	Because that's where I found it. I was there.

EVELYN	You were actually at Hamunaptra?
O'CONNELL	I just decked your brother
EVELYN	Yes, well...  I know my brother.

O'CONNELL	Yeah, I was there.
EVELYN	You swear?
O'CONNELL	Every damn day.
EVELYN	No, I mean --
O'CONNELL	-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
EVELYN	What did you find? What did you see?
O'CONNELL	I found sand. I saw death.

EVELYN	Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
O'CONNELL	Want to know?

EVELYN	Yes.
O'CONNELL	Really want to know?

O'CONNELL	Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
EVELYN	Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.

O'CONNELL	Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
EVELYN	The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
O'CONNELL	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
EVELYN	If you call that a kiss.

EVELYN	Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
O'CONNELL	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.

O'CONNELL	There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
EVELYN	Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?

O'CONNELL	Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
EVELYN	Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.

EVELYN	I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
O'CONNELL	And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?

EVELYN	You know your history.
O'CONNELL	I know my treasure.

O'CONNELL	Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
EVELYN	Oh that's comforting.

O'CONNELL	Can you swim?
EVELYN	Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
O'CONNELL	Trust me.

O'CONNELL	We're almost there.
EVELYN	Are you sure?

EVELYN	For what?
O'CONNELL	We're about to be shown the way.

EVELYN	That "thing" gets me excited.
O'CONNELL	The things that get you excited.
EVELYN	According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
O'CONNELL	What are those mirrors for?
EVELYN	Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

EVELYN	Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
O'CONNELL	Preparation for what?
EVELYN	For entering the afterlife.

O'CONNELL	Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
EVELYN	You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.

EVELYN	Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
O'CONNELL	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
EVELYN	They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.

O'CONNELL	There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
EVELYN	Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

EVELYN	A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
O'CONNELL	Who was talking about what?

O'CONNELL	Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
EVELYN	How?
O'CONNELL	Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

EVELYN	You two!
O'CONNELL	You don't believe in curses, huh?
EVELYN	No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.

O'CONNELL	Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
EVELYN	I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
O'CONNELL	Something like that.
EVELYN	Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
O'CONNELL	Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?

EVELYN	I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
O'CONNELL	And what is that?

EVELYN	I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
O'CONNELL	No you're not.
EVELYN	I'm not?
O'CONNELL	Not unless you call me Rick.
EVELYN	Why would I do that?
O'CONNELL	Because that's my name.

EVELYN	No... Why?... Should I?
O'CONNELL	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.

EVELYN	Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
O'CONNELL	You dream about dead guys?

O'CONNELL	Is he supposed to look like that?
EVELYN	No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...

O'CONNELL	Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
EVELYN	Very slowly.

EVELYN	According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
O'CONNELL	That bad huh?
EVELYN	Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
O'CONNELL	The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.

O'CONNELL	You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
EVELYN	It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.

EVELYN	Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
O'CONNELL	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
EVELYN	No, we are not.

EVELYN	No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
O'CONNELL	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
EVELYN	Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.

EVELYN	Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
O'CONNELL	There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!

EVELYN	According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
O'CONNELL	Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
EVELYN	It's everybody's problem!
O'CONNELL	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
EVELYN	That's what I am to you? A contract?
O'CONNELL	You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
EVELYN	I'm staying.
O'CONNELL	FINE.

O'CONNELL	He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
EVELYN	The creature!? Are you sure!?

EVELYN	You called me your girl?
O'CONNELL	What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
EVELYN	I think you were jealous
O'CONNELL	Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?

EVELYN	Got it!
O'CONNELL	Got what?

O'CONNELL	Don't do it, Evelyn.
EVELYN	I have no choice.

O'CONNELL	Got guts, lady.
EVELYN	Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.

EVELYN	You...! YOU...!
JONATHAN	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.

EVELYN	Have you no respect for the dead?
JONATHAN	Right now, I only wish to join them.

EVELYN	Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
JONATHAN	My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.

JONATHAN	Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
EVELYN	Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.

EVELYN	Jonathan?
JONATHAN	Yes?
EVELYN	I think you found something.

JONATHAN	Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
EVELYN	He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
JONATHAN	Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.

EVELYN	Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
JONATHAN	Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
EVELYN	All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.

EVELYN	You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
JONATHAN	I was mistaken.
EVELYN	You lied to me!
JONATHAN	I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
EVELYN	I'm your sister.
JONATHAN	That just makes you more gullible.
EVELYN	You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
JONATHAN	Picked his pocket, actually.

EVELYN	But he's just a filthy criminal?
JONATHAN	Way to go, Evy.

EVELYN	Do you really think he'll show up?
JONATHAN	Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
EVELYN	Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.

JONATHAN	Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
EVELYN	After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.

EVELYN	According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
JONATHAN	And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.

EVELYN	It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
JONATHAN	Still...

EVELYN	What do you suppose killed him?
JONATHAN	Did you ever see him eat?

EVELYN	I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
JONATHAN	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
EVELYN	Well neither do I, thank you.

JONATHAN	Juicy?
EVELYN	Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.

JONATHAN	I found it, Evy! I found it
EVELYN	Shut-up and get me off of here!

JONATHAN	What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
EVELYN	Read the inscription on the cover!

EVELYN	Finish the inscription, idiot!
JONATHAN	Oh.

JONATHAN	Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
EVELYN	What's it look like!?

EVELYN	Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
JONATHAN	Yes,... I see.

JONATHAN	She's my sister, actually.
O'CONNELL	Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.

O'CONNELL	Hey,... don't I know you?
JONATHAN	Um, well, you see...

JONATHAN	Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
O'CONNELL	I only gamble with my life, never my money.

JONATHAN	I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
O'CONNELL	We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
JONATHAN	Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
O'CONNELL	Awfully.

JONATHAN	That thing gives me the creeps.
O'CONNELL	Be nice. That thing saved my life.

O'CONNELL	You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
JONATHAN	And it stinks to high heaven in here.

O'CONNELL	None taken.
JONATHAN	We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
O'CONNELL	And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?

O'CONNELL	Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
JONATHAN	OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

JONATHAN	Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
O'CONNELL	No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,

O'CONNELL	Tough break.
JONATHAN	Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?

O'CONNELL	Where's my gun?
JONATHAN	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
O'CONNELL	If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

JONATHAN	You did not!?... We're not!?
O'CONNELL	Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.

JONATHAN	He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
O'CONNELL	Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.

JONATHAN	Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
O'CONNELL	That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!

JONATHAN	Who's here!?
O'CONNELL	The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

JONATHAN	That looked rather painful.
O'CONNELL	Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
JONATHAN	Yes, I know, I do that to people.

O'CONNELL	Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
JONATHAN	And then he'll be coming after Evy.

O'CONNELL	Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
JONATHAN	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back

O'CONNELL	What?
JONATHAN	What?

O'CONNELL	We gotta get her back.
JONATHAN	I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.

O'CONNELL	Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
JONATHAN	He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
O'CONNELL	Got it.

O'CONNELL	Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
JONATHAN	You have got to be joking?

ANNE	I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
MARION	It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.

ANNE	Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
MARION	No.
ANNE	Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
MARION	No.
ANNE	Good.

MARION	When?
ANNE	Late summer.
MARION	Congratulations.
ANNE	Thank you.

ANNE	I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
GABRIEL	I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
ANNE	It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
GABRIEL	Uh... uh... I...

GABRIEL	If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
ANNE	You call that a compliment?
GABRIEL	It's a start.

ANNE	Next time we'll bring more blankets.
GABRIEL	That would be nice.
ANNE	Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
GABRIEL	That would be nice, too.

BILLINGS	You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
MARION	I expect to try.
BILLINGS	Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
MARION	It worked.  How many men can you raise?
BILLINGS	Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.

BILLINGS	I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
MARION	His journals, letters, maps, books...

BILLINGS	Am I one of that sort?
MARION	You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.

BILLINGS	Well?
MARION	I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
BILLINGS	Cheerful news to greet the morn.
MARION	His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.

BILLINGS	Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
MARION	Pride will do.

BILLINGS	He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
MARION	No, he takes after his mother...

MARION	What do you mean, old and ugly?
BILLINGS	You got me beat on both accounts.
MARION	The hell I do.

GABRIEL	He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
BILLINGS	He's not making light.

BILLINGS	You don't know him very well, do you?
GABRIEL	He's my father.

GABRIEL	I know him well enough?
BILLINGS	Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

BILLINGS	You got salt last week.
GABRIEL	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
BILLINGS	We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.

MARION	They're from good stock on their mother's side.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.

MARION	You look well, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	As do you.

CHARLOTTE	And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
MARION	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.

MARION	How did this... how did I let this happen?
CHARLOTTE	You couldn't have known.
MARION	I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
CHARLOTTE	Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
MARION	I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.

CHARLOTTE	If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
MARION	I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.

MARION	Excuse me?
CHARLOTTE	I said, I'm not my sister.
MARION	I know that.
CHARLOTTE	Do you?
MARION	Of course, I do.
CHARLOTTE	Very well, then.

MARION	Goodbye, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	Goodbye.

MARION	Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
CHARLOTTE	Lovely.

TARLETON	You're surrendering.
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	Yes, sir.
TARLETON	What unit?
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
TARLETON	Who cared for your wounds?

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT	We did.
TARLETON	With a lace table cloth?

CORNWALLIS	My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
MARION	My pleasure, sir.
CORNWALLIS	Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
MARION	Apology accepted.
CORNWALLIS	Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
MARION	Colonel will do.
CORNWALLIS	As you wish.

MARION	Shall we proceed?
CORNWALLIS	Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
MARION	I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
CORNWALLIS	Oh?
MARION	I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
CORNWALLIS	Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
MARION	Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.

CORNWALLIS	You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
MARION	Very well, proceed, sir.
CORNWALLIS	First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
MARION	I will do so as soon as possible.

CORNWALLIS	Thank you.
MARION	Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
CORNWALLIS	Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
MARION	That one is a bit more difficult.
CORNWALLIS	Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
MARION	And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
CORNWALLIS	Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
MARION	Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
CORNWALLIS	That is a separate issue.
MARION	I consider them linked.
CORNWALLIS	I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
MARION	As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.

CORNWALLIS	Very well, let us move on to...
MARION	Prisoner exchange.
CORNWALLIS	Sir?
MARION	You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
CORNWALLIS	I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
MARION	If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
CORNWALLIS	What officers?

CORNWALLIS	Their names, ranks and posts?
MARION	They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.

CORNWALLIS	My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
TARLETON	Sir.

CORNWALLIS	Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
TARLETON	Yes, sir.

CORNWALLIS	It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
TARLETON	Are you going to meet with him?
CORNWALLIS	Most certainly.  Arrange it.

CORNWALLIS	If I fail, you fail.
TARLETON	Perhaps.
CORNWALLIS	And if I triumph, you triumph.
TARLETON	Probably.
CORNWALLIS	How can we end this madness?
TARLETON	Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.

CORNWALLIS	Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
TARLETON	I understand, sir.

CORNWALLIS	Do you see that, Colonel?
TARLETON	Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.

GABRIEL	Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
MARION	Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?

GABRIEL	The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
MARION	The middle colonies?
GABRIEL	Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
MARION	Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
GABRIEL	Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.

MARION	What news?
GABRIEL	The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
MARION	Is that why the Assembly was convened?
GABRIEL	Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
MARION	And the Governor?
GABRIEL	He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
MARION	Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.

GABRIEL	Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
MARION	When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
GABRIEL	When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.

MARION	Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
GABRIEL	Yes.

GABRIEL	Have you seen any Redcoats?
MARION	Not yet.  What happened?

GABRIEL	I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
MARION	You're in no condition to ride.
GABRIEL	I have no choice, I...

GABRIEL	Father...
MARION	It's already over.

GABRIEL	What now, sir?
MARION	We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
GABRIEL	We'd cover more ground if we split up.
MARION	It's safer if we stay together.

GABRIEL	Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
MARION	Oh?
GABRIEL	I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
MARION	Is that so?
GABRIEL	Yes, sir.  My father taught me.

MARION	Did your father teach you humility?
GABRIEL	He tried.  It didn't take.

MARION	Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
GABRIEL	Yes, sir.

MARION	And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
GABRIEL	Yes...  ... father.

MARION	Is it?
GABRIEL	If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
MARION	How old are you?
GABRIEL	You know how old I am.
MARION	God help us all when you're forty.

GABRIEL	Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
MARION	Flanking riders?
GABRIEL	I didn't see any.

MARION	These four wagons must be his.
GABRIEL	And the dogs, too, I'll wager.

MARION	Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
GABRIEL	Father?
MARION	Pride is his weakness.

MARION	Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
GABRIEL	We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.

GABRIEL	Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
MARION	I should have killed him when I had the chance?
GABRIEL	When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
MARION	No...
GABRIEL	Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.

MARION	Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
GABRIEL	She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
MARION	You learned her lessons better than I.
GABRIEL	She got me at a more impressionable age.

MARION	She spoke?  Susan spoke?
GABRIEL	Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
MARION	I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...

GABRIEL	She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
MARION	She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?

GABRIEL	Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
MARION	What?
GABRIEL	Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.

GABRIEL	Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
MARION	Granted.  Where are you going?
GABRIEL	Cheraw Falls.
MARION	It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
GABRIEL	I know.

GABRIEL	Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
MARION	Where?
GABRIEL	Seven homes along the Black River so far...

MARION	Don't go in there.
GABRIEL	Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
MARION	She is.  Don't go in there.

GABRIEL	Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
MARION	You know what happened.
GABRIEL	No, I don't.
MARION	Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
GABRIEL	Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
MARION	And what do they know?
GABRIEL	That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
MARION	That's right.
GABRIEL	That's not enough.  Tell me.
MARION	Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.

MARION	That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
GABRIEL	I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.

MARION	We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
GABRIEL	Go on.
MARION	We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.

MARION	It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
GABRIEL	I see, do as I say, not as I do.
MARION	Yes.

MARION	If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
GABRIEL	As you did at Fort Wilderness?

GABRIEL	He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
SUSAN	He left us.
GABRIEL	I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.

GABRIEL	There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
SUSAN	I don't care.  I hate him.
GABRIEL	You don't hate him.
SUSAN	Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.

ROBINSON	An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
LEE	Please.
ROBINSON	Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
LEE	Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.

LEE	Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
ROBINSON	I stand corrected.
LEE	Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...

LEE	Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
MARION	It's Mister Marion.
LEE	I understood him to be a Patriot as well.

LEE	Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
MARION	Harry, Harry, Harry...

LEE	A long time ago...
MARION	Thirteen years...
LEE	That's a damn long time...

MARION	You were an Englishman then...
LEE	I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...

MARION	We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
LEE	Balderdash!
MARION	There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
LEE	Name five hundred.
MARION	Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
LEE	That's five, keep going...
MARION	... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
LEE	You said bribery twice...

LEE	Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
MARION	That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
LEE	And your principles?
MARION	I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.

LEE	One of yours?
MARION	Gabriel.
LEE	I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
MARION	No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
LEE	I'll see to it that he serves under me.
MARION	Thank you.

MARION	Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
LEE	I'm sorry.
MARION	I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
LEE	There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
MARION	We saw.
LEE	I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
MARION	Where is he now?
LEE	Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
MARION	Who's in command?
LEE	I am, I think.
MARION	What are my orders?

LEE	We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
MARION	So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
LEE	And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
MARION	When?
LEE	Fall, six months at the earliest.
MARION	Long time.
LEE	The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
MARION	So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
LEE	Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
MARION	You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
LEE	Not held, just slowed down.
MARION	They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
LEE	They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
MARION	How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
LEE	Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.

MARION	His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
LEE	I'm sorry, I didn't know.

MARION	Don't touch him.
LEE	How many men have we seen die?
MARION	Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
LEE	They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
MARION	It is ended.
LEE	No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.

LEE	Goodbye, Francis.
MARION	Goodbye, Harry.

MARION	And congratulations on the birth of your son.
LEE	Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
MARION	I hope so.

MARION	Your son, what did you name him?
LEE	Robert.  Robert E. Lee.

MAJOR HALBERT	Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
MARION	Thank you.
MAJOR HALBERT	You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
MARION	I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
MAJOR HALBERT	Yes, quite, but you should know that...
MARION	That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
MAJOR HALBERT	Yes... you will wait.

MARGARET	How far away?
MARION	Four, five miles.

MARION	Don't worry.
MARGARET	We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
MARION	No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.

MARION	Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
MARGARET	But what about Thomas?
MARION	Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.

MARION	Reverend.
REV. OLIVER	I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.

REV. OLIVER	Thank you.
MARION	For what?
REV. OLIVER	For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
MARION	Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.

MARION	It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
REV. OLIVER	For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.

MARION	How many came back?
REV. OLIVER	About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.

REV. OLIVER	Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
MARION	He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
REV. OLIVER	Yes, he does.

MARION	Gray.
WASHINGTON	Earned.

WASHINGTON	I was sorry to hear about your son.
MARION	I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
WASHINGTON	I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.

WASHINGTON	Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
MARION	Remember Braddock?
WASHINGTON	That bad?
MARION	Worse.
WASHINGTON	Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.

WASHINGTON	If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
MARION	No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
WASHINGTON	And what is the second thing?

MARION	Not yet, Thomas.
THOMAS	When?

MARION	Seventeen.
THOMAS	But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
MARION	God willing.

MARION	Put those away.
THOMAS	But father, they might come this way.
MARION	Put them away.

NATHAN	Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
MARION	Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?

NATHAN	Father?
MARION	Six-pounders.  Lots of them.

NATHAN	Father, you can't let them take him...
MARION	Quiet.

NATHAN	Father... I killed those men...
MARION	Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
NATHAN	I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...

CLAY	Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
GARDNER	Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.

GARDNER	You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
CLAY	Maybe he did.
GARDNER	We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
CLAY	I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
GARDNER	And that's more important than finding Lednov?
CLAY	Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.

CLAY	Who shot who?
GARDNER	Nobody. The light was bad.

GARDNER	What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
CLAY	I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
GARDNER	All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
CLAY	Look of things, she doesn't.
GARDNER	Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.

MRS. WYATT	You don't know how good it is to see you.
CLAY	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.

MRS. WYATT	Tell them to come on in.
CLAY	But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
MRS. WYATT	It doesn't matter who they are.
CLAY	And one of 'em is sick.
MRS. WYATT	Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.

CLAY	Anybody hurt?
MARY	No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?

CLAY	What's the matter with her?
MARY	Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?

CLAY	This must have been in the family a long time.
MARY	It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.

MARY	And this is Helen Carter.
CLAY	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.

CLAY	Yes, ma'am.
MARY	As far as -- Sonora?
CLAY	Just about.

MARY	They won't be riding in the wagon.
CLAY	Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
MARY	You can't leave us here.
CLAY	Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.

MARY	What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
CLAY	You can stay here if you like.
MARY	We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
CLAY	I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.

MARY	Our kind of women?
CLAY	You'll have to drive -- except down hill.

CLAY	What's the matter with her?
MARY	Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?

MARY	And this is Helen Carter.
CLAY	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.

MARY	So am I.
CLAY	It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.

MARY	Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
CLAY	Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
MARY	But you eat, don't you?
CLAY	Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
MARY	Where do you keep the can opener?
CLAY	In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.

CLAY	Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
MARY	And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.

MARY	If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
CLAY	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.

CLAY	Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
MARY	Would you, Mr. Phillips?
CLAY	Go on, there's a good boy.

MARY	There's a nice boy.
CLAY	Yeah.
MARY	That why you always took him on the other side of the street?

MARY	Like what?
CLAY	Like sticking his nose into other people's business.

CLAY	Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
MARY	He's learning his letters.
CLAY	Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.

MARY	Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
CLAY	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
MARY	They're stragglin'.
CLAY	His letters will keep.

CLAY	But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
MARY	Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
CLAY	No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.

MARY	So that was why she tried to run away.
CLAY	Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
MARY	I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
CLAY	Hold on.
MARY	We can't stay here!
CLAY	It's a long walk back to Aspen.

CLAY	Coffee?
MARY	No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
CLAY	I hope so, too.

CLAY	I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
MARY	I suppose it is.
CLAY	And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --

MARY	You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
CLAY	I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
MARY	You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.

MARY	I hope you get everything you want out of life --
CLAY	Thanks.
MARY	You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
CLAY	The who?
MARY	You should know. She's in your dream.

MARY	Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
CLAY	Go on. Tell me more about her.
MARY	She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
CLAY	I'll make the soap myself.
MARY	But the rest is right.
CLAY	Will she be dark or fair?
MARY	Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.

MARY	He knows his alphabet.
CLAY	That's fine.

MARY	Are we leaving?
CLAY	It's too light yet.

CLAY	Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
MARY	You're not going out to look for them?
CLAY	No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.

MARY	Don't you trust me?
CLAY	Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.

MARY	Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
CLAY	Why do you think?
MARY	I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
CLAY	Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.

CLAY	You know so much about me -- figure it out.
MARY	So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.

CLAY	You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
MARY	Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.

MARY	You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
CLAY	Maybe it's better that way.
MARY	You don't mean that Clay.

MARY	Tell me, darling.
CLAY	What?
MARY	What does a man usually tell a girl?

CLAY	What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
MARY	I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.

MARY	I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
CLAY	If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
MARY	Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
CLAY	All right -- it's said!
MARY	Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.

MARY	No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
CLAY	I suppose that's my fault.

MARY	All my clothes --
CLAY	That's right -- worry about your clothes --

MARY	Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
CLAY	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.

CLAY	So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
MARY	If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
CLAY	Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.

MARY	I won't have you fighting over me.
CLAY	I'm sorry.

MARY	Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
CLAY	It's going to Sonora.
MARY	Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.

MARY	Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
CLAY	I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.

MARY	I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
CLAY	Hurry up.

MARY	I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
CLAY	Maybe they will.

MARY	Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
CLAY	Goodbye, Mary.
MARY	By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.

CLAY	Thanks for taking over.
MARY	Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
CLAY	Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.

CLAY	Where you going?
MARY	To the other side of the street.

CLAY	That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
MARY	Why?
CLAY	Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
MARY	I haven't got the job yet.

CLAYTON	Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
CLAY	Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
CLAYTON	A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.

CLAYTON	I found their surrey --
CLAY	So did I. They were in it.
CLAYTON	She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.

CLAY	Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
CLAYTON	Hello, Miss Wells.

ELAINE	I -- lost something.
CLAY	It wouldn't happen to be this...

CLAY	Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
ELAINE	Which ranch?
CLAY	How's that?

CLAY	I can't --
ELAINE	You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
CLAY	No they won't.

STEVE	How does she draw?
CLAY	A little hot.

CLAY	That's right.
STEVE	I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.

STEVE	Who's Lednov?
CLAY	A man I used to know.

STEVE	You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
CLAY	Like what?

STEVE	Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
CLAY	I don't want to run short.
STEVE	You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
CLAY	No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
STEVE	Nice.

STEVE	But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
CLAY	The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

STEVE	What was he in jail for?
CLAY	You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
STEVE	In a fight?
CLAY	The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
STEVE	This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.

STEVE	You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
CLAY	Yes.
STEVE	At the ranch maybe?
CLAY	Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
STEVE	Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
CLAY	All right. I'll tell you.

CLAY	That's Lednov!  We come along here.
STEVE	And meet him there.
CLAY	Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.

STEVE	Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
CLAY	Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
STEVE	Why?
CLAY	He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
STEVE	Lednov.

STEVE	They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
CLAY	Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.

CLAY	I've got eleven horses.
STEVE	Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.

STEVE	Where'd they go?
CLAY	Swimming.

STEVE	There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
CLAY	How'd you happen to miss?
STEVE	They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
CLAY	Good thing you didn't.

STEVE	A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
CLAY	That's right, Steve.
STEVE	Can I have my gun back?
CLAY	Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.

CLAY	It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
STEVE	I won't again.

STEVE	Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
CLAY	I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
STEVE	Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
CLAY	You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
STEVE	Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
CLAY	That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
STEVE	Oh... that's the time you went away.
CLAY	I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
STEVE	Maybe you shoulda killed him.
CLAY	Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
STEVE	Yeah, it does.
CLAY	But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?

STEVE	Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
CLAY	Finished, son?
STEVE	There's only two of them now.

CLAY	Don't go arguing with your teacher.
STEVE	I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
CLAY	There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.

STEVE	Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
CLAY	Just the grub box and bed rolls.

STEVE	I didn't stop to think, Clay.
CLAY	You better start.

CLAY	All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
STEVE	That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.

CLAY	Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
STEVE	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
CLAY	Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
STEVE	What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.

STEVE	Go on, hit me.
CLAY	Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
STEVE	You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
CLAY	You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
STEVE	Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.

CLAY	I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
STEVE	You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --

STEVE	You know what she asked me?
CLAY	I don't care what she asked you.
STEVE	She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...

STEVE	It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
CLAY	You want to split up? --

STEVE	Half of them are mine.
CLAY	You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.

CLAY	What did you come back for?
STEVE	Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.

CLAY	Is that the only reason you came back?
STEVE	Sure. What other reason would there be?
CLAY	I just wondered. Let's go.

CLAY	How's that?
STEVE	Kind of sore.
CLAY	You'll live.
STEVE	Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
CLAY	Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
STEVE	So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
CLAY	I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
STEVE	Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...

WYATT	You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
CLAY	Three men on matched roans?

WYATT	Yeah, how did you know?
CLAY	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.

CLAY	I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
WYATT	All right, you didn't know.
CLAY	I can't take her with me.
WYATT	Nobody asked you to.

CLAY	You're not bein' quite fair.
WYATT	What's there to be fair about?

CLAY	I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
WYATT	All right, you didn't know.
CLAY	I can't take her with me.
WYATT	Nobody asked you to.

CLAY	You're not bein' quite fair.
WYATT	What's there to be fair about?

STEVE	You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
ELAINE	I don't care.
STEVE	Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
ELAINE	I said I didn't care.
STEVE	What's botherin' you, anyway?

STEVE	Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
ELAINE	Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
STEVE	Don't act so -- crazy.
ELAINE	I'm sorry. Let's go.
STEVE	That's a good girl.

ELAINE	Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
HELEN	He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
ELAINE	Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
HELEN	If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
ELAINE	It isn't that --
HELEN	Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
ELAINE	But I want to stay.
HELEN	Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.

ELAINE	I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
HELEN	Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
ELAINE	Stop it -- stop it.
HELEN	Darling -- now I've got you all upset.

ELAINE	Go away -- please.
HELEN	That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --

ELAINE	She mustn't -- don't you let her --
HELEN	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
ELAINE	If she says anything to them I'll kill her.

FOWLER	You got no business snoopin' around --
HELEN	Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.

HELEN	That something I shouldn't see?
FOWLER	No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.

HELEN	What is it?
FOWLER	Just a thing I was workin' on.
HELEN	The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.

FOWLER	Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
HELEN	You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?

FOWLER	That sure smells good.
HELEN	I like it.
FOWLER	Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
HELEN	Then why stay in the hills.

HELEN	You're sure there's more where this came from?
FOWLER	Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.

FOWLER	I figure we'll get along just fine.
HELEN	Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.

LEDNOV	I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
FOWLER	Well, say it.

LEDNOV	What's the matter -- restless?
FOWLER	Yes, people make me restless.
LEDNOV	Even women?
FOWLER	There aren't any women here.
LEDNOV	I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
FOWLER	Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
LEDNOV	And you're all alone.
FOWLER	Yeah.

LEDNOV	Suppose I take a look.
FOWLER	Go ahead.

LEDNOV	When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
FOWLER	They went on like I told you.

MARY	Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
GRAHAM	What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
MARY	Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
GRAHAM	Depends on how good you drive.

GRAHAM	There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
MARY	Thank you, Mr. Graham.

MARY	Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
GRAHAM	They shouldn't have done that.
MARY	We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
GRAHAM	I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.

MARY	Goodbye and thanks.
GRAHAM	I don't like to see you go.

HELEN	Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
MARY	Maybe in Sonora.

HELEN	You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
MARY	Now where's she goin'? --

HELEN	With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
MARY	Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.

HELEN	It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
MARY	That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
HELEN	Quit worryin' about Elaine.

MARY	I tried my best, but these things take time.
HELEN	And we're running out of that.
MARY	There's still tomorrow morning.

HELEN	How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
MARY	Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
HELEN	We don't want to go there.
MARY	No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
HELEN	Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
MARY	He certainly could. About a month.
HELEN	What are you waiting for? Do something.

HELEN	You're not giving up?
MARY	How many ways can a man say no.

HELEN	Maybe I better start working on him.
MARY	You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...

HELEN	Go on. Have another try at him.
MARY	What's the use.
HELEN	Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.

MARY	We might as well start a fire.
HELEN	Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.

MARY	Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
HELEN	Maybe you are. I'm not.

MARY	-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
HELEN	Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.

HELEN	I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
MARY	That's it then.

HELEN	Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
MARY	I don't care what he thinks.

LEDNOV	How do you know who we are?
HELEN	Everybody knows --
LEDNOV	Who brought you here?

LEDNOV	You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
HELEN	Stop it --

HELEN	Clay Phillips.
LEDNOV	Where is he?
HELEN	Up the trail.

LEDNOV	How far up the trail?
HELEN	I don't know -- I don't know.

LEDNOV	We got to get movin'.
MCCALL	What for?
LEDNOV	Because there's a man I want to see.
MCCALL	He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.

LEDNOV	I said let's go.
MCCALL	One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
LEDNOV	I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.

MCCALL	We got company. Female company.
LEDNOV	Yeah, we sure have.

WYATT	Why, yes. They're all I need...
LEDNOV	Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.

WYATT	He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
LEDNOV	Put on another one.
WYATT	That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
LEDNOV	Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.

WYATT	What are you doin' --
LEDNOV	Lookin' around.

STEVE	Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
MARY	I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?

MARY	Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
STEVE	I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.

MARY	Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
STEVE	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
MARY	But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?

STEVE	It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
MARY	Don't you even know your letters?

MARY	Would you like to learn them?
STEVE	I sure would.
MARY	Maybe I could start you out.
STEVE	That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.

STEVE	You're so nice.
MARY	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
STEVE	Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.

STEVE	Good night, Miss Wells.
MARY	Good night, Steve.

STEVE	Gee, I can't.
MARY	Why not? You went farther than that last time.
STEVE	I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
MARY	Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
STEVE	Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --

STEVE	Aren't we stayin'?
MARY	No. We're not stayin' --

STEVE	What comes after Z?
MARY	That's the end of the line.
STEVE	Then I know my alphabet.
MARY	From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.

STEVE	And that's tough, isn't it?
MARY	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.

STEVE	-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
MARY	There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.

STEVE	U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
MARY	Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
STEVE	What do they look like?
MARY	Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
STEVE	Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
MARY	No.
STEVE	How about California?
MARY	Would they be good to eat?
MARY	Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
STEVE	Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...

STEVE	An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
MARY	You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
STEVE	I feel good anyways.

MARY	Well, Steve?
STEVE	Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?

STEVE	Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
MARY	Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.

STEVE	Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
MARY	And you've got me all figured out?
STEVE	Sure.

STEVE	Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
MARY	You were supposed to be reading words.
STEVE	I was doin' both. Here.

STEVE	Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
MARY	But you're his brother.
STEVE	He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?

MARY	She was only teasin'.
STEVE	Oh, sure.
MARY	Let me do that.

MARY	For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
STEVE	It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.

STEVE	You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
MARY	Thanks, Steve.

STEVE	You don't know what it is to be sorry.
MARY	Steve --

MARY	Goodnight.
STEVE	Goodnight, Miss Wells.
MARY	If you need me, I'll be --

EMMETT	I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
DAWSON	Posse? What the hell you talking about?
EMMETT	My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.

DAWSON	You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
EMMETT	Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.

EMMETT	I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
DAWSON	No money, eh?
EMMETT	The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.

EMMETT	If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
DAWSON	What do you mean, the horses?

JAKE	Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
EMMETT	Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
JAKE	You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.

JAKE	All I did was kiss a girl.
EMMETT	That's why they got you in jail?
JAKE	Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.

JAKE	So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
EMMETT	...And you had to kill him?
JAKE	No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
EMMETT	You're in here for winging a guy?

JAKE	Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
EMMETT	What friend is that?
JAKE	The one with the shotgun.

EMMETT	Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
JAKE	Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

JAKE	I think we lost 'em.
EMMETT	There's nobody coming?

EMMETT	Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
JAKE	Your next water ain't for three days.

EMMETT	Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
JAKE	It was my fault.

MCKENDRICK	Emmett.
EMMETT	McKendrick.

MCKENDRICK	I didn't know you were out.
EMMETT	Did it seem short to you?

MCKENDRICK	That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
EMMETT	Sounds good.
MCKENDRICK	All right then.  Let's go.

MCKENDRICK	Forget it.
EMMETT	Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.

MAL	After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
EMMETT	Where were you?
MAL	Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.

EMMETT	Maybe we'll see you sometime.
MAL	Yeah... maybe. So long.

EMMETT	...Gotta go...
MAL	Sure.

EMMETT	Where are we?
MAL	Someplace safe. How you feeling?

EMMETT	I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
MAL	I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
EMMETT	That's it.

MAL	This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
EMMETT	I'm sorry.

EMMETT	I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
MAL	You'll never make it.
EMMETT	Have to.

MAL	I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
EMMETT	Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
MAL	So far that's all I seen in this life.

MAL	I almost didn't.
EMMETT	Where's Jake?
MAL	McKendrick's men got him.
EMMETT	Is he alive?

EMMETT	Kate?
MAL	She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.

EMMETT	Gotta go.
MAL	Right.

HANNAH	More than enough.
EMMETT	Have you thought at all about your plans?
HANNAH	Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.

EMMETT	The Parkers seem like nice folks.
HANNAH	They've been kind to me.
EMMETT	Paden sends his best.
HANNAH	I guess I put a good scare into him.

HANNAH	I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
EMMETT	I just came out to say goodbye.
HANNAH	Goodbye?
EMMETT	Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.

HANNAH	You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
EMMETT	That's why I'm here.

EMMETT	You don't make it easy on a fellow.
HANNAH	Didn't Paden tell you that?

HANNAH	Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
EMMETT	Yeah... that must have been it.

EMMETT	Are you all right?
HANNAH	This is a brutal land.
EMMETT	You must have known that before you came.
HANNAH	It's one thing to know it...

HANNAH	We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
EMMETT	How's Mr. Parker doing?
HANNAH	Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.

HANNAH	Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
EMMETT	I already did that.
HANNAH	This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
EMMETT	That I do.

HOBART	I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
EMMETT	I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
HOBART	You're not Baxter?
EMMETT	My name is Emmett.
HOBART	And you're not Baxter, either?

EMMETT	Hobart, what are you people doing here?
HOBART	This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
EMMETT	Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
HOBART	And they were two of them. Look --

EMMETT	I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
LANGSTON	In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
EMMETT	All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.

EMMETT	I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
LANGSTON	Ten A.M.
EMMETT	Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.

LANGSTON	Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
EMMETT	I haven't done anything.
LANGSTON	I want you out of town before the hanging.
EMMETT	I'll be long gone.

EMMETT	Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
PADEN	You got no idea what they were after?

PADEN	Offend anybody lately?
EMMETT	Not for five years.

PADEN	Jefferson City?
EMMETT	No, Leavenworth.
PADEN	I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
EMMETT	I had to get up anyway.
PADEN	Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
EMMETT	Looks like that's not all they admired.
PADEN	Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.

EMMETT	Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
PADEN	Where's the pinto going?
EMMETT	I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
PADEN	Where's Turley?
EMMETT	South of here, past Chimayo.
PADEN	Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
EMMETT	Yeah, maybe a bath.

EMMETT	I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
PADEN	And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.

EMMETT	I gotta be going.
PADEN	Going to Turley, was it?
EMMETT	Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.

PADEN	What's Turley like?
EMMETT	It's a town...
PADEN	They got a saloon there?
EMMETT	I expect.
PADEN	Women?
EMMETT	I expect.

PADEN	Doesn't look quite fair.
EMMETT	Which way do you mean?

PADEN	Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
EMMETT	He is that.
PADEN	I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
EMMETT	Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.

PADEN	You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
EMMETT	I understand.
PADEN	It's not going to be easy.
EMMETT	It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.

PADEN	Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
EMMETT	No hard feelings.
PADEN	C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
EMMETT	You haven't got any money.
PADEN	All right, you buy me a drink.

PADEN	You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
EMMETT	Anybody got any ideas?

EMMETT	Where you been?
PADEN	Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.

PADEN	I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
EMMETT	I'll be around.

PADEN	Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
EMMETT	Yeah?
PADEN	All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
EMMETT	I'm going to California with my brother.

PADEN	Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
EMMETT	Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

EMMETT	I'll see you around.
PADEN	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

EMMETT	You might make a farmer yet.
PADEN	I've got a job.

MAL	Daddy?
EZRA	I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.

MAL	Where is Rae?
EZRA	She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
MAL	What happened?
EZRA	They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
MAL	Who?
EZRA	The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
MAL	You own this land.
EZRA	I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
MAL	What about the law?
EZRA	Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.

EZRA	That's a lie.
MAL	Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.

PADEN	He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
HANNAH	I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
PADEN	Never will again.
HANNAH	We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.

HANNAH	Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
PADEN	And a pretty lady.

HANNAH	A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
PADEN	Believe it.
HANNAH	They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
PADEN	Why?
HANNAH	Because they don't like what I want.
PADEN	What's that?
HANNAH	I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.

KATE	J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
J.T.	Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.

KATE	Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
J.T.	The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
KATE	Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.

KATE	It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
J.T.	His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
KATE	I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.

JAKE	You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
PADEN	I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
JAKE	Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
PADEN	I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
JAKE	Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
PADEN	The other guy drew first.
JAKE	Right!

JAKE	Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
PADEN	We didn't get that far.
JAKE	Blind Pete taught me a great trick.

JAKE	That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
PADEN	What now?
JAKE	We wait.

PADEN	Where's your brother?
JAKE	He'll be here.

JAKE	This a friend of yours?
PADEN	He is now.
JAKE	Who is he?
PADEN	Oh, a guy who got run out of town...

PADEN	Get out of here, Jake.
JAKE	All I did was kiss the girl.
PADEN	That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
JAKE	What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
PADEN	I don't want you getting anyone in my place.

JAKE	New record.
PADEN	Let's get out of here.

SHERIFF COBB	Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
KELLY	Howdy.
SHERIFF COBB	Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.

KELLY	You wanted to see me?
SHERIFF COBB	We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.

KELLY	What are you talking about?
SHERIFF COBB	I'm done talking. Get out.
KELLY	You can't do this.
SHERIFF COBB	Really?

LANGSTON	There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
MAL	I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
LANGSTON	Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
MAL	Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
LANGSTON	You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
MAL	That ain't right.
LANGSTON	I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.

LANGSTON	What's all this then?
PROPRIETOR	This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
LANGSTON	I don't like that word much, Carter.
PROPRIETOR	We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
LANGSTON	Is that a fact?

PROPRIETOR	Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
LANGSTON	Don't press your luck, Carter.

LANGSTON	Now let's talk about you chaps.
PADEN	We'd rather stay.
LANGSTON	We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
PADEN	You're kidding.
LANGSTON	But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?

LANGSTON	The jury saw it differently.
PADEN	So this is the guy you're going to hang?
LANGSTON	Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
PADEN	I was afraid of that.

MAL	Hello, Rae.
RAE	What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
MAL	Daddy's dead.

MAL	He was murdered.
RAE	Who did it?
MAL	I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
RAE	Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.

MAL	What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
RAE	It's none of your business.
MAL	Rae, all we got is each other.
RAE	I don't have any family any more.

RAE	Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
MAL	Rae, I need help.
RAE	Why come to me?
MAL	Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
RAE	What's stopping you?
MAL	They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
RAE	What makes you think I could?
MAL	Why would they stop you?
RAE	Because I'm your sister.

MAL	Why him?
RAE	Shut up. You need help, don't you?

MAL	This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
PADEN	Good luck, Mal.

PADEN	Why are they doing this, Mal?
MAL	Because they enjoy it.
PADEN	I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
MAL	You don't know?

MAL	I got there just short of too late.
PADEN	Lucky.

MAL	Yeah, it's working out real good.
PADEN	Where's Emmett now?

SHERIFF COBB	He must be pretty good.
MCKENDRICK	He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
SHERIFF COBB	What about his brother?
MCKENDRICK	We'll handle that. He's careless.

SHERIFF COBB	Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
MCKENDRICK	I heard that too.
SHERIFF COBB	Did you hear his son is still around?

PADEN	Hello, Cobb.
SHERIFF COBB	Hello, Paden. How ya doing?

SHERIFF COBB	I see you're prospering without me.
PADEN	It's been a while.
SHERIFF COBB	Where's the dog?

PADEN	Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
SHERIFF COBB	Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
PADEN	I've given that up.
SHERIFF COBB	So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
PADEN	You've got a legitimate job.
SHERIFF COBB	Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
PADEN	You're right.

SHERIFF COBB	This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
PADEN	Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.

SHERIFF COBB	You got a place to stay?
PADEN	I just got to town.
SHERIFF COBB	Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?

SHERIFF COBB	What brings you into my saloon?
PADEN	Luck, I guess.
SHERIFF COBB	Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
PADEN	You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.

SHERIFF COBB	Nothing like that will happen between us.
PADEN	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.

SHERIFF COBB	I took out thirteen dollars.
PADEN	This is a lot of money.
SHERIFF COBB	I told you this was a sweet set-up.
PADEN	It is that.
SHERIFF COBB	Maybe you could run it without Stella.

SHERIFF COBB	Easy, boy. Just an idea.
PADEN	Well, thanks, but forget it.
SHERIFF COBB	You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.

PADEN	What is it you want from me?
SHERIFF COBB	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
PADEN	I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
SHERIFF COBB	So we understand each other?
PADEN	Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.

SHERIFF COBB	I'm going to have to look into this.
PADEN	Yeah, maybe I will too.
SHERIFF COBB	I thought we talked about that.
PADEN	We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.

SHERIFF COBB	You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
PADEN	I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.

SHERIFF COBB	I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
PADEN	Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
SHERIFF COBB	I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
PADEN	What's she got to do with it?
SHERIFF COBB	Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.

SHERIFF COBB	What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
PADEN	Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
SHERIFF COBB	Good-bye, Paden.

PADEN	You work here?
STELLA	I run the place. What can I get you?

PADEN	Nifty.
STELLA	The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
PADEN	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
STELLA	Stella.
PADEN	Paden.

PADEN	Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
STELLA	I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.

PADEN	My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
STELLA	Thanks. That's what I call it too.
PADEN	And I know what I'm talking about.
STELLA	You like a good saloon?
PADEN	It's the only place I'm happy.
STELLA	Me too. What's wrong with us?

PADEN	You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
STELLA	You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?

STELLA	That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
PADEN	So-called?
STELLA	Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
PADEN	Why'd you go into business with him?
STELLA	I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
PADEN	Who's the owner?
STELLA	Here he comes right now.

PADEN	Is this a fair mix?
STELLA	I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
PADEN	I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.

PADEN	What's this?
STELLA	That's the good stuff.
PADEN	Oh, yeah? How good?

STELLA	You really are a gambler.
PADEN	Give me some of the good stuff.

STELLA	Where's the dog now?
PADEN	He left me.

STELLA	What is it that I can't figure?
PADEN	What do you mean?
STELLA	Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.

PADEN	What makes you say that?
STELLA	If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
PADEN	You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
STELLA	Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
PADEN	Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.

STELLA	Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
PADEN	I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
STELLA	I'm ready for that.

STELLA	How about you?
PADEN	I don't want you to get hurt.
STELLA	He can't hurt me if he's dead.

STELLA	I've got a place I can hide her.
PADEN	You better get in there with her until this thing is over.

SHERIFF COBB	Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
STELLA	That was my plan.
SHERIFF COBB	Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.

SHERIFF COBB	It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
STELLA	I wouldn't worry about that.
SHERIFF COBB	I thought you two would get along.

STELLA	From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
SHERIFF COBB	He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.

CLAYTON	Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
BANDIT	Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
CLAYTON	You.
BANDIT	Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
CLAYTON	You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
BANDIT	Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.

CLAYTON	Get your hands off my daughter!
BANDIT	Your what?

KYLE	Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

KYLE	What's he get if he wins here?
BANDIT	If...?

KYLE	I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
BANDIT	America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
KYLE	You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.

BANDIT	You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
KYLE	What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
BANDIT	I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.

KYLE	I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
BANDIT	You know how rumors start.

KYLE	Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
BANDIT	Last year, this was a new rig.
KYLE	But it wasn't a Kenworth.

KYLE	I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
BANDIT	How much style?
KYLE	Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
BANDIT	You paying for the gas?

KYLE	You got my barley pop?
BANDIT	What do you think?

KATE	Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
BANDIT	All sound reasons for matrimony.
KATE	Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
BANDIT	Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.

KATE	Kate McConnell.
BANDIT	Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.

KATE	Why're you driving so fast?
BANDIT	I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
KATE	Why? You have a bowling date?
BANDIT	Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
KATE	Who'd want to?
BANDIT	I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
KATE	Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
BANDIT	For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
KATE	A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
BANDIT	It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
KATE	But you could get killed, right?
BANDIT	Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
KATE	An existentialist.
BANDIT	A what?
KATE	Eyes on the road.

KATE	So tell me about yourself.
BANDIT	Okay.

KATE	Well?...
BANDIT	Whaddya want to know? My sign?
KATE	No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
BANDIT	Having fun.
KATE	Is this fun?
BANDIT	Driving?
KATE	Driving, talking to me...
BANDIT	They're both a challenge.
KATE	You have a great profile.
BANDIT	Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.

KATE	Where you from?
BANDIT	Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
KATE	Seriously?!?
BANDIT	Would I lie to you?

KATE	Guess what?
BANDIT	I give up.
KATE	You just passed your nemesis.

KATE	What the hell's going on?
BANDIT	I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.

BANDIT	Anything?
KATE	We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.

KATE	Can I ask you something?
BANDIT	Shoot.
KATE	What do you want to be when you grow up?

KATE	You know, you're not a bad driver.
BANDIT	You know, you're not a bad passenger.

BANDIT	That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
KATE	I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
BANDIT	A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.

KATE	You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
BANDIT	Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.

BANDIT	Well?
KATE	We lost him.

BANDIT	Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
KATE	I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.

BANDIT	Christ, what channel are we on?...
KATE	Eleven.

BANDIT	The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
KATE	Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
BANDIT	Hey...
KATE	Enjoy your Kenworth.

KATE	Jesus!!!
BANDIT	Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

BANDIT	See ya, Kate.
KATE	Ciao.

BANDIT	What the hell are you doing?!?
KATE	He's after us again!

BANDIT	You know this guy, don't you?
KATE	I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
BANDIT	By stealing my car?
KATE	I would've come back for you.
BANDIT	Yeah.
KATE	Yeah.

KATE	Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
BANDIT	You could've asked.
KATE	You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.

BANDIT	Where did you learn how to drive like this?
KATE	Like what?

BANDIT	Mississippi's the other way!
KATE	You want to lose this putz or not?!?

KATE	-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
BANDIT	Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
KATE	Uh-oh.

BANDIT	Let's hit it.
KATE	Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.

KATE	You plan on driving trucks all your life?
BANDIT	No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.

BANDIT	-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
KATE	Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
BANDIT	I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
KATE	You plan on driving trucks all your life?
BANDIT	I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
KATE	Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?

BANDIT	An unmarked police car.
KATE	How do you know?
BANDIT	I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.

BANDIT	I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
KATE	You take the front, I'll take the back.

BANDIT	I'm proud of you.
KATE	Yeah?
BANDIT	You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.

BANDIT	Kate...
KATE	Ummm?
BANDIT	I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
KATE	Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.

KATE	-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
BANDIT	And?
KATE	He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.

KATE	My very words.
BANDIT	Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.

KATE	They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
BANDIT	Bandit II?

KATE	-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
BANDIT	It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
KATE	What kind of a guy is he?
BANDIT	The minute you see him, you'll know.

KATE	What are you gonna do when you get home?
BANDIT	Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?

KATE	Why are you stopping?
BANDIT	Weight Station.

KATE	One to five?
BANDIT	Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.

BANDIT	Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
KATE	Well, thanks for the lift.
BANDIT	Hey...

BANDIT	What can I say?
KATE	Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.

KATE	He's just exhausted.
BANDIT	That man is your father?!?

KATE	I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
BANDIT	Absolutely.
KATE	Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.

KATE	What are you thinking?
BANDIT	You gotta admire the man's determination.

KATE	See ya, Bandit.
BANDIT	See ya, Kate.

HOT PANTS	Why should I?
BANDIT	Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.

HOT PANTS	I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
BANDIT	Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?

BANDIT	What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
HOT PANTS	Yes.
BANDIT	I'm begging.
HOT PANTS	I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
BANDIT	But you'll do it?
HOT PANTS	I'll do it.
BANDIT	I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
HOT PANTS	You sure do.

WAITRESS	What's your pleasure?
BANDIT	Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
WAITRESS	No what?
BANDIT	Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.

WAITRESS	Order up!
BANDIT	That's me.

WAITRESS	Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
BANDIT	Another time.

BANDIT	Cledus.
CLEDUS	No.
BANDIT	Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.

CLEDUS	Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
BANDIT	How'd you know?

CLEDUS	Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
BANDIT	Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
CLEDUS	That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
BANDIT	No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
CLEDUS	Or in the slammer.
BANDIT	Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
CLEDUS	Waynette!

CLEDUS	Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
BANDIT	Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.

CLEDUS	You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
BANDIT	Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
CLEDUS	No.
BANDIT	See.
CLEDUS	Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
BANDIT	And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.

BANDIT	How long's this gonna take?
CLEDUS	I don't know, man. Ask him?
BANDIT	We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
CLEDUS	If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
BANDIT	Also boring.
CLEDUS	But I still don't think...

CLEDUS	What are you doin' now?
BANDIT	Running blocker.

CLEDUS	All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
BANDIT	Go.
CLEDUS	Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
BANDIT	Six. Got it.
CLEDUS	If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
BANDIT	Twenty-one is nineteen.
CLEDUS	If I say go to two, it's really one.
BANDIT	Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.

CLEDUS	You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
BANDIT	I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
CLEDUS	Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah?
CLEDUS	Why are we doing this?
BANDIT	Because they said it couldn't be done.

CLEDUS	Loud and clear.
BANDIT	Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.

CLEDUS	He's history.
BANDIT	Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.

BANDIT	Shit! No one's here.
CLEDUS	That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
BANDIT	Let's keep it that way.

CLEDUS	Liquid gold.
BANDIT	Redneck heaven.

CLEDUS	You know how to drive one of these things?
BANDIT	Can a pig whistle?

CLEDUS	Hit the brakes!
BANDIT	They're jammed!

BANDIT	Let's get the hell outta here.
CLEDUS	Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
BANDIT	Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.

BANDIT	We still on schedule?
CLEDUS	Forty-two minutes ahead.

BANDIT	I hate to say I told you so.
CLEDUS	Save it. We got a long haul.
BANDIT	Clear and rolling.

CLEDUS	Bandit I, do you copy?
BANDIT	This is Bandit I, come back.

BANDIT	You can't swear on these.
CLEDUS	What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
BANDIT	Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.

CLEDUS	This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
BANDIT	On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
CLEDUS	Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
BANDIT	What's your twenty?
CLEDUS	I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
BANDIT	Not for long, you ain't.

CLEDUS	What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
BANDIT	If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.

CLEDUS	I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
BANDIT	What does the old Timex say?
CLEDUS	She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
BANDIT	I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.

CLEDUS	Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah, guy?
CLEDUS	Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 

CLEDUS	My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
BANDIT	On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
CLEDUS	Do I have a choice?
BANDIT	What's your twenty?
CLEDUS	'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.

BANDIT	I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
CLEDUS	What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
BANDIT	As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
CLEDUS	If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.

BANDIT	-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
CLEDUS	I'm at marker eight-five.
BANDIT	Son-of-a-gun. Me too.

CLEDUS	I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
BANDIT	I ran into complications.
CLEDUS	I hate to say it...
BANDIT	Then don't.
CLEDUS	-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
BANDIT	Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
CLEDUS	Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
BANDIT	We're gone.
CLEDUS	Bandit?

BANDIT	Never mind. It's nothing.
CLEDUS	Anything else you don't want me to know?
BANDIT	Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.

BANDIT	Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
CLEDUS	Now what?
BANDIT	We're outta motion lotion.
CLEDUS	I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.

BANDIT	-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
CLEDUS	I'll believe it when I see it.

CLEDUS	I'm all ears, good buddy.
BANDIT	You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
CLEDUS	It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
BANDIT	We'll be waiting. Over.

CLEDUS	Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
BANDIT	You okay?
CLEDUS	Just fine. What's the weather like?
BANDIT	God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
CLEDUS	Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?

BANDIT	-- How we doing?
CLEDUS	It's gonna be close. Real close.

CLEDUS	Talk to me.
BANDIT	We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
CLEDUS	Let's boogie.

CLEDUS	I'm all ears.
BANDIT	You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.

BANDIT	Bandit II?
CLEDUS	I'm here.
BANDIT	You're coming up to the scale house.
CLEDUS	I'm cucumber cool.

CLEDUS	Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
BANDIT	What's that, pardner?
CLEDUS	Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.

BANDIT	How's the clock, Bandit II.
CLEDUS	Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.

CLEDUS	Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
BANDIT	Yeah, but...
CLEDUS	When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
BANDIT	But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
CLEDUS	Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.

VOICE	Breaker. Breaker.
BANDIT	Go breaker.
VOICE	Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
BANDIT	Go head on, breaker.
VOICE	I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
BANDIT	What's your twenty and what's your handle?
VOICE	My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.

VOICE	My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
BANDIT	Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.

VOICE	Breaker. Breaker.
BANDIT	Pick it up, Breaker.
VOICE	Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
BANDIT	What's up, Dixie Chicken?

BANDIT	Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
VOICE	Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
BANDIT	What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?

DICKEY	It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
BANDIT	See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.

DICKEY	I think you're just yellow.
BANDIT	Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.

DICKEY	Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
BANDIT	Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
DICKEY	He's thirsty.

DICKEY	Have any trouble getting here?
BANDIT	About one to five years worth.

CLEDUS	Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
OWNER	You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
CLEDUS	Uh-uh. What Cobra?
OWNER	Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
CLEDUS	Oh, yeah. Good for him.
OWNER	I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.

CLEDUS	Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
KATE	Believe me, that won't be a problem.

KATE	This is Bandit I. Over.
CLEDUS	Where the hell are you?
KATE	Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...

CLEDUS	Shut up, Fred.
KATE	Who's Fred?

KATE	Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
CLEDUS	I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.

KATE	Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
CLEDUS	That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
KATE	What's he...

KATE	I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
CLEDUS	Yes, ma'am.
KATE	How's your twenty?

KATE	Bandit two, you read me?
CLEDUS	You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

DICKEY	Is that Bandit in the lead?
KYLE	If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
DICKEY	I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
KYLE	Then it must be a helluva idea.

DICKEY	Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
KYLE	Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

DICKEY	But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
KYLE	That's the point, Dickey.
DICKEY	Oh.
KYLE	Now, you just find him, son.
DICKEY	Yes, sir.

DICKEY	Five thou.
KYLE	Chickenshit money.

KYLE	That crazy sumbitch made it.
DICKEY	Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.

VOICE ONE	-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
VOICE ONE	-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
VOICE TWO	-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
VOICE ONE	-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.

VOICE ONE	-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
VOICE ONE	-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.

ACOSTA	It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
SECURITY SUPERVISOR	And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.

ACOSTA	So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR	That's correct.
ACOSTA	But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR	Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
ACOSTA	-- so you shut them off?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR	Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
ACOSTA	What kind of personnel?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR	Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
ACOSTA	You have a butler working that floor?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR	Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
ACOSTA	So there are no guests staying on that floor?

ACOSTA	C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR	No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
ACOSTA	Is your security team armed?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR	Of course. Yes.
ACOSTA	And who has access to that floor?

MESSNER	Anything on the Swede?
CARRUTHERS	Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
MESSNER	Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
CARRUTHERS	Maybe.

MESSNER	I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
CARRUTHERS	And a very bad gamble.
MESSNER	Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.

CARRUTHERS	Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
MESSNER	No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --

MESSNER	Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
CARRUTHERS	Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
MESSNER	Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.

MESSNER	But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
CARRUTHERS	Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
MESSNER	Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.

MESSNER	So he has no idea what's about to happen?
CARRUTHERS	No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
MESSNER	What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
CARRUTHERS	Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.

MESSNER	He's giving them up?
CARRUTHERS	All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
MESSNER	Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
CARRUTHERS	That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.

MESSNER	What about the sheriff's task force?
CARRUTHERS	Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.

MESSNER	Deputy, have you made any ID's?
CARRUTHERS	Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.

CARRUTHERS	Maroon uniforms?
MESSNER	Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
CARRUTHERS	No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.

MESSNER	How bad?
CARRUTHERS	Mortal.
MESSNER	No.
CARRUTHERS	Yeah.

CASINO EMPLOYEE	Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
MESSNER	-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
CASINO EMPLOYEE	He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
MESSNER	Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?

MESSNER	Did he give you his name?
CASINO EMPLOYEE	Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
MESSNER	-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
CASINO EMPLOYEE	-- he was wearing one of our jackets.

MESSNER	Who?
CASINO EMPLOYEE	The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...

MESSNER	This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
CASINO EMPLOYEE	Uh, yeah.
MESSNER	You're sure?
CASINO EMPLOYEE	Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
MESSNER	And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
CASINO EMPLOYEE	Yeah.
MESSNER	And that didn't seem odd to you?

ELMORE	You investigating those murders out at the lake?
DARWIN TREMOR	Ww... uh...
ELMORE	Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.

DARWIN TREMOR	Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
ELMORE	You shot me and murdered my friends.
DARWIN TREMOR	I did. We -- yeah, I know.
ELMORE	And threw us into the lake.
DARWIN TREMOR	Pretty much, yep.

ELMORE	And this is your car, isn't it?
DARWIN TREMOR	Mmm-hmm.
ELMORE	But there were more of you?
DARWIN TREMOR	Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
ELMORE	Two of 'em?
DARWIN TREMOR	Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
ELMORE	You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.

DUPREE	...I forgive you Darwin.
DARWIN TREMOR	Shoot, I appreciate that man.
DUPREE	If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
DARWIN TREMOR	You woulda?
DUPREE	Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
DARWIN TREMOR	Damn... alright then.
DUPREE	I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.

DARWIN TREMOR	Really?
DUPREE	I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.

DARWIN TREMOR	Man, that's great.
DUPREE	I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
DARWIN TREMOR	You think so?

ISRAEL	Are you on a land line?
DR. GILL	Yeah, why.

DR. GILL	I've got concerns.
ISRAEL	...About what?
DR. GILL	About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
ISRAEL	I'm not doing cocaine.
DR. GILL	Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.

DR. GILL	-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
ISRAEL	That's not possible. I told you.
DR. GILL	There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
ISRAEL	Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
DR. GILL	No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
ISRAEL	-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.

DR. GILL	I'm here, where's the car?
ISRAEL	I sent Hugo, he should be there!

ELMORE	What happened?
DUPREE	The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.

DUPREE	His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
ELMORE	Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.

DUPREE	So I guess you're not going.
ELMORE	Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.

DUPREE	I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
ELMORE	That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.

ELMORE	Yeah, we've been through that.
DUPREE	Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
ELMORE	-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
DUPREE	Your attitude sucks.
ELMORE	I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?

DUPREE	Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
ELMORE	Then what --

ISRAEL	D'you talk to'm?
HUGO	I got his machine.

ISRAEL	What'd you say?
HUGO	I said I got his machine.
ISRAEL	No, what did you say on the machine?
HUGO	I left him a message.
ISRAEL	I know you left him a message. What did you say!

ISRAEL	Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
HUGO	Okay.
ISRAEL	Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?

HUGO	I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
ISRAEL	Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?

HUGO	About what?
ISRAEL	Look at the collar on that coat...

HUGO	I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
ISRAEL	Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."

HUGO	I could have it sent out...
ISRAEL	...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?

HUGO	Do you want me to say I did it?
ISRAEL	I was kinda hoping, yeah.
HUGO	Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
ISRAEL	Only if you really, truly mean it.

HUGO	...I'm sorry...
ISRAEL	Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
HUGO	I am. Yeah.
ISRAEL	Without peer?
HUGO	I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

HUGO	Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
ISRAEL	That's right! RIGHT NOW!

ISRAEL	Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
SIR IVY	We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
ISRAEL	Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...

ISRAEL	That's probably him now...
SIR IVY	...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.

SIR IVY	Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
ISRAEL	That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.

SIR IVY	FUCK YOU!
ISRAEL	GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!

ISRAEL	They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
MECKLEN	I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
ISRAEL	Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."

MECKLEN	Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
ISRAEL	-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.

MECKLEN	And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
ISRAEL	I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
MECKLEN	-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
ISRAEL	-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --

MECKLEN	Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
ISRAEL	They what? What? No. No. Why?
MECKLEN	The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...

LOCKE	Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
MESSNER	I thought Heller was a double op?

MESSNER	So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
LOCKE	Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.

MESSNER	A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
LOCKE	His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.

MESSNER	So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
LOCKE	-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.

LOCKE	On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
MESSNER	You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
LOCKE	Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...

MESSNER	It's the last place they'd look.
LOCKE	Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.

LOCKE	Here. Sit.   Please.
MESSNER	This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
LOCKE	Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.

MESSNER	What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
LOCKE	We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.

MESSNER	Where's Israel?
LOCKE	What are you doing here?
MESSNER	My debrief --
LOCKE	-- will be handled back in --
MESSNER	-- no, we need to handle it now.

LOCKE	I can't discuss --
MESSNER	-- You can and you will.
LOCKE	You're finished.
MESSNER	And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?

MESSNER	...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
LOCKE	-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.

MESSNER	...Does he know?
LOCKE	...He does now...

LOCKE	Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
MESSNER	So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
LOCKE	Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.

MESSNER	...When did you know all this?
LOCKE	Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --

LOCKE	...Are you insane?
MESSNER	...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."

MESSNER	You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
LOCKE	It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
MESSNER	...Yeah, fifty-three.
LOCKE	The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...

MESSNER	...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
LOCKE	Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.

LOCKE	The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
MESSNER	...So you made another deal?
LOCKE	I wouldn't go that far.
MESSNER	But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?

MESSNER	You're trying to save Sparazza?
LOCKE	No... We're trying to save Heller.
MESSNER	...So you knew all this and yet y--
LOCKE	-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
MESSNER	...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
LOCKE	I don't see it like that at all.

LOCKE	I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
MESSNER	No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.

SERNA	Buzzy... Buzz...?
PADICHE	Yeah... Sid?
SERNA	You got clicks, anything?
PADICHE	Nah, nuthin' on my end --
SERNA	-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --

SERNA	Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
PADICHE	I'm here.

SERNA	Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
PADICHE	-- he's doing it then, huh --
SERNA	-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
PADICHE	-- okay, g'head --
SERNA	So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.

PADICHE	No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
SERNA	Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
PADICHE	Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
SERNA	Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.

PADICHE	... Jesus... what for?
SERNA	-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
PADICHE	Wow.
SERNA	Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
PADICHE	Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
SERNA	Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
PADICHE	That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
SERNA	Yeah, I can front this.
PADICHE	Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
SERNA	That's the punchline, y'ready?
PADICHE	Shoot.
SERNA	A million flat.
PADICHE	No shit.
SERNA	None whatsoever.

SERNA	Buzzy... Buzz...?
PADICHE	Yeah... Sid?
SERNA	Right, you got clicks, anything?
PADICHE	Nah, nuthin' on my end --

SERNA	So how we lookin'?
PADICHE	Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
SERNA	Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
PADICHE	Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?

PADICHE	Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
SERNA	Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
PADICHE	How are we on time...?

SERNA	Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
PADICHE	Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?

PADICHE	-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
SERNA	Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
PADICHE	I'm working on it.
SERNA	Bag this fucker Buzzy.
PADICHE	It's gettin' done Sid.

SIR IVY	Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
SYKES	You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
SIR IVY	-- never in a million girl --
SYKES	-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
SIR IVY	No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
SYKES	You love her?
SIR IVY	My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
SYKES	Got hit twice.
SIR IVY	It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.

SIR IVY	I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
SYKES	You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
SIR IVY	What were you doin' here anyway?
SYKES	'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.

SYKES	We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
WATTERS	What are we talkin' on the split...

WATTERS	Why?
SYKES	'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
WATTERS	Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --

WATTERS	Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
SYKES	A Fed? Like FBI?
WATTERS	It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...

SYKES	When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
WATTERS	I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
SYKES	Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
WATTERS	...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.

SYKES	You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
WATTERS	The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
SYKES	Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.

WATTERS	...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
SYKES	I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
WATTERS	He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
SYKES	You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
WATTERS	Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.

SYKES	Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
WATTERS	What!?
SYKES	Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
WATTERS	Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
SYKES	-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
WATTERS	I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
SYKES	Fuck you.

WATTERS	What'd you say?
SYKES	Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."

WATTERS	Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
SYKES	No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
WATTERS	-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
SYKES	-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.

SYKES	What's wrong?
WATTERS	Security's locking down the elevators.

SYKES	I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
WATTERS	C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?

SYKES	...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
WATTERS	What?
SYKES	They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
WATTERS	...What are they doin' right now...?

SYKES	Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
WATTERS	Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...

WATTERS	I DON'T KNOW!
SYKES	Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--

SYKES	Bulllllshit...
WYMAN	Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.

SYKES	And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
WYMAN	No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
SYKES	What else did Padiche say?
WYMAN	He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.

WYMAN	Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
SYKES	What's the time frame?
WYMAN	Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.

WIN	Claire!
CLAIRE	Hello, Win.

WIN	Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
CLAIRE	They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
WIN	And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
CLAIRE	You didn't like him?
WIN	Looks a little constipated to me.
CLAIRE	It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.

CLAIRE	It's terrific Win.
WIN	You still writing the occasional magazine article?
CLAIRE	Occasionally.
WIN	Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.

CLAIRE	I've never seen anyone killed before.
MIKE	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...

CLAIRE	Straight ahead.
MIKE	Hard to find doors in this place.

MIKE	Hi.
CLAIRE	I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
MIKE	Uh...
CLAIRE	I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
MIKE	I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
CLAIRE	Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
MIKE	Right.  That's true.
CLAIRE	Can we go then?
MIKE	I'm supposed to call in.
CLAIRE	There's a phone in the car.

CLAIRE	Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
MIKE	Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.

CLAIRE	What did he say?
MIKE	He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.

CLAIRE	You live in Manhattan?
MIKE	Queens... You know Queens?
CLAIRE	My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.

CLAIRE	I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
MIKE	Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...

CLAIRE	Are you nervous?
MIKE	No, Ma'am.

CLAIRE	Would you pick one out, please?
MIKE	Beg pardon?
CLAIRE	Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.

CLAIRE	Put it on my account, please.
MIKE	I got money.

CLAIRE	You can touch me, I won't bite.
MIKE	Not too sure about that.

CLAIRE	People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
MIKE	Hey!  There are crazy people here.
CLAIRE	Let's get a drink.
MIKE	Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.

CLAIRE	I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
MIKE	I'll come with you.
CLAIRE	I think I can probably do that on my own.

CLAIRE	Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
MIKE	I came on at 8:00.

MIKE	You all right?
CLAIRE	Yeah.
MIKE	I'm sorry about what happened.
CLAIRE	Listen, that was my fault.
MIKE	I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
CLAIRE	If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.

CLAIRE	I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
MIKE	Sooner, the better.
CLAIRE	He said he'd kill me.
MIKE	Big talk... Desperate guy.
CLAIRE	Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?

MIKE	Claire?
CLAIRE	Hmm...
MIKE	You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
CLAIRE	Urdu and Hindi.
MIKE	Yeah, what a woman.

CLAIRE	Didn't do very well, did you?
MIKE	Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
CLAIRE	You were reading my Renoir.
MIKE	How did you know?
CLAIRE	You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
MIKE	They're kind of fuzzy.
CLAIRE	You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
MIKE	No kidding.

CLAIRE	So, this could be your last night, huh?
MIKE	Could be, I guess.
CLAIRE	Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
MIKE	Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.

CLAIRE	You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
MIKE	Absolutely.  Look at this.

CLAIRE	That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
MIKE	No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
CLAIRE	And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
MIKE	Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
CLAIRE	Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.

MIKE	... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
CLAIRE	So it was "love".
MIKE	Yeah.  It was.
CLAIRE	And "is"...?

MIKE	Yeah.
CLAIRE	That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
MIKE	No dog.
CLAIRE	I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
MIKE	No dog.
CLAIRE	But "nice".
MIKE	Very nice.

MIKE	What about Neil?
CLAIRE	You don't like him, do you?
MIKE	What's to like?
CLAIRE	Tell it like it is.
MIKE	You asked.
CLAIRE	He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
MIKE	You could do better.
CLAIRE	I'll miss you, Mike...

CLAIRE	It was nice having you "watch over me"...
MIKE	Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.

CLAIRE	Good night, Mike.
MIKE	Sleep good.

MIKE	Claire?
CLAIRE	What do you want?
MIKE	Open the door, will you?
CLAIRE	I can't open it.
MIKE	It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...

CLAIRE	You put me life in danger.
MIKE	No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
CLAIRE	And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!

CLAIRE	You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
MIKE	Claire, will you calm down?
CLAIRE	I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
MIKE	Claire...!

MIKE	Stop, will you?!
CLAIRE	Let go!
MIKE	Stop being nuts!
CLAIRE	I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
MIKE	I do care about you!
CLAIRE	More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?

MIKE	Yeah.
CLAIRE	They called here after you left...
MIKE	She's okay.  Everything's okay...

MIKE	I don't know you...
CLAIRE	This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
MIKE	You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
CLAIRE	Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.

CLAIRE	You told her?
MIKE	Not exactly.
CLAIRE	What do you want to do?
MIKE	I don't know.

MIKE	You don't want to know.
CLAIRE	Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
MIKE	I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
CLAIRE	Oh God, that's great!
MIKE	Are you okay?
CLAIRE	Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --

CLAIRE	I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
MIKE	Oh that thing in Queens.
CLAIRE	I'm going away after that, the next morning.

MIKE	Where?
CLAIRE	Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.

MIKE	When can I see you?
CLAIRE	I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.

MIKE	Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
CLAIRE	Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
MIKE	I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
CLAIRE	Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?

MIKE	Claire...
CLAIRE	No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
MIKE	I'll think about Wednesday.

CLAIRE	What a memory.
MIKE	Do you dance?
CLAIRE	Do you?
MIKE	Pretty bad.
CLAIRE	Let's do it.

MIKE	They guys treatin' you all right?
CLAIRE	Yeah.
MIKE	I've been doing a lot of thinking.
CLAIRE	I know.

MIKE	It wouldn't work.
CLAIRE	I know.

MIKE	I'd miss my life...
CLAIRE	... Don't explain.

MIKE	How long you going away for?
CLAIRE	Long enough.
MIKE	For...?
CLAIRE	To... Forget about you.

CLAIRE	I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
MIKE	Yeah...

CLAIRE	... Mike.
MIKE	It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.

MIKE	Claire!
CLAIRE	Mike...?

CLAIRE	Everyone's all right...?
MIKE	Yeah.  It's all over.

MIKE	So.
CLAIRE	So.

MIKE	You still going away?
CLAIRE	I don't know...
MIKE	You don't have to, now.
CLAIRE	I think it's probably still a good idea.

CLAIRE	I'll miss you, Mike.
MIKE	Listen, I'll... see you again.

MIKE	I like your coat.
CLAIRE	You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
MIKE	I do.

CLAIRE	Say goodbye, Mike.
MIKE	You take care.

GIDDINGS	Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
CLAIRE	It was something my father always liked me to do.
GIDDINGS	You're planning to speak?
CLAIRE	Not if you don't want me to.
GIDDINGS	Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
CLAIRE	Just putting in an appearance then.

NEIL	... just saying you should think twice about it...
CLAIRE	... I don't want to talk about it...

CLAIRE	... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
NEIL	Claire...
CLAIRE	... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
NEIL	Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
CLAIRE	And I'm making mine.

NEIL	You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
CLAIRE	What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
NEIL	Claire...

TOMMY	Keep what handy?
ELLIE	Nothing.
TOMMY	The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.

TOMMY	We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
ELLIE	Sure we are, let's go!

TOMMY	Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
ELLIE	I don't know Tommy.

TOMMY	Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
ELLIE	Absolutely.

ELLIE	Tommy...!
TOMMY	I'm all right.

MIKE	Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
ELLIE	Too kinky.

MIKE	Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
ELLIE	Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
MIKE	Take my advice, don't buy any...

ELLIE	Mike?
MIKE	What?
ELLIE	My ass if falling.
MIKE	Your what...?
ELLIE	My ass is falling.  It is.
MIKE	What are you talking about?
ELLIE	I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
MIKE	Get in bed.
ELLIE	What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
MIKE	You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.

ELLIE	Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
MIKE	You got no idea...
ELLIE	Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.

ELLIE	So how'd it go?
MIKE	Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.

ELLIE	For how long?
MIKE	'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.

MIKE	Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
ELLIE	I can still use a gun.
MIKE	Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.

ELLIE	Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
MIKE	I think television's a dangerous thing.
ELLIE	It's twenty bucks in the bank.

MIKE	Hey.  The neighbors.
ELLIE	Let 'em eat their hearts out.

ELLIE	I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
MIKE	Well, actually, she looks better than that.

MIKE	Okay?
ELLIE	Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.

ELLIE	The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
MIKE	Oh, some shit.
ELLIE	What shit, honey?
MIKE	You don't want to hear about it.

ELLIE	Honey.  You got him.
MIKE	I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
ELLIE	She's got to identify him.
MIKE	Why?
ELLIE	Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
MIKE	I think -- she's crazy.
ELLIE	I'd identify him.
MIKE	I might stop you.

ELLIE	Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
MIKE	No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
ELLIE	Where'd you get the tie?

MIKE	Bought it.
ELLIE	It's not your taste.
MIKE	What did she say the down payment was?
MIKE	She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
ELLIE	She took you shopping for a tie?
MIKE	I had to follow her to a store.
ELLIE	What's wrong with your paisley tie?
MIKE	Ellie, it was a formal party...
ELLIE	Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
MIKE	I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
ELLIE	I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
MIKE	She bought it.
ELLIE	Why?
MIKE	I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?

ELLIE	Coming to bed?
MIKE	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
ELLIE	Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
MIKE	I'll be right up.

ELLIE	What?
MIKE	Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.

ELLIE	Mike, take it easy...
MIKE	Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
ELLIE	It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
MIKE	It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
ELLIE	Did you hear what I said?
MIKE	Did you hear what I said?!!

ELLIE	I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
MIKE	I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.

ELLIE	C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
MIKE	D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
ELLIE	What was that?
MIKE	You heard me.
ELLIE	Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
MIKE	What're you talking about --
ELLIE	I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!

ELLIE	You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
MIKE	I'm sorry.
ELLIE	I'm not saying it's your fault.

MIKE	What did you do tonight?
ELLIE	I watched TV.
MIKE	What did you watch?
ELLIE	I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.

ELLIE	Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
MIKE	Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
ELLIE	I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
MIKE	Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
ELLIE	I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
MIKE	You talked to his wife?

MIKE	My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
ELLIE	What's the difference?

MIKE	Let me drive...
ELLIE	Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
MIKE	El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...

ELLIE	I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
MIKE	What about Tommy?
ELLIE	He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?

ELLIE	Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
MIKE	No.

MIKE	Ellie...
ELLIE	I'm all right.

ELLIE	He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
MIKE	Me neither.

GARBER	I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
MIKE	I just sat and listened.
GARBER	Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.

MIKE	Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
GARBER	When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.

MIKE	What about when she goes out?
GARBER	Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.

MIKE	But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
GARBER	You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
MIKE	It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
GARBER	Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
MIKE	Even Joey Venza?!
GARBER	He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
MIKE	What about when she identifies him?!
GARBER	If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.

MIKE	They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
GARBER	I heard.

GARBER	I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
MIKE	It should've been me...

MIKE	What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
GARBER	Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.

MIKE	At my house...!
KOONTZ	Call a cruiser!

KOONTZ	Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
MIKE	Koontz!  I need you guys!
KOONTZ	We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
MIKE	No, I need'm now!

MIKE	No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
KOONTZ	I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.

T.J.	Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
MIKE	Right behind you, T.J.

MIKE	Who's Joey Venza?
T.J.	Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.

MIKE	Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
T.J.	Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
MIKE	You in this with me?
T.J.	Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.

MIKE	Not Koontz.
T.J.	Be happy.  He's good at this.

T.J.	Wasn't your fault.
MIKE	It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

T.J.	Tell me I'm dreamin'.
MIKE	I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

MIKE	Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
PRETTY YOUNG THING	Ever shot anyone?
MIKE	Yes.
PRETTY YOUNG THING	Does it make you... hard?
MIKE	... Hard?
PRETTY YOUNG THING	Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.

NEIL	Are you in charge here?
MIKE	No, sir...
NEIL	I asked for the man in charge...
MIKE	That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
NEIL	Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
MIKE	Is she injured?

NEIL	You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
MIKE	She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
NEIL	No, I will not step outside.
MIKE	Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
NEIL	I don't really see what that has to do with...

NEIL	You're here 'til what time?
MIKE	I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

VENZA	You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
MIKE	That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
VENZA	You should'a brought the girl.
MIKE	I brought the girl.  She's outside.

VENZA	Hold it...!
MIKE	I'll prove it!

VENZA	How do I know that's her?
MIKE	I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
VENZA	Why should she come in?
MIKE	She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
VENZA	Bullshit!  Prove it.
MIKE	Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!

MIKE	I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
VENZA	I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
MIKE	Let my kid go.
VENZA	I'm not lettin' no one go.
MIKE	Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
VENZA	Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
MIKE	Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.

VENZA	Under the table.
MIKE	I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.

MIKE	Watch your step!
VENZA	What the fuck you doin'?!

TOMMY	What're we having?
MIKE	My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
TOMMY	Scrambled eggs surprise?

MIKE	How do you know where the gun is?
TOMMY	I know where everything is.
MIKE	Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
TOMMY	Lay back, Mack.
MIKE	Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?

TOMMY	God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
MIKE	Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

TOMMY	Nice threads Dad.
MIKE	Yeah, I think so.

MIKE	How are things going, pal?
TOMMY	Okay, I guess.
MIKE	How about dinner tonight?
TOMMY	Mom and I got plans.
MIKE	What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
TOMMY	She's taking singing lessons.
MIKE	She's what?
TOMMY	She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.

MIKE	What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
TOMMY	We're gonna pass the street.

TOMMY	You coming in?
MIKE	No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
TOMMY	We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
MIKE	So, what are you doing tonight?
TOMMY	Shooting.
MIKE	Shooting?
TOMMY	Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.

MIKE	Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
TOMMY	I don't think she can sing, either.
MIKE	Take care, pal.

ADELE	Sexual tension...
LIZ	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...

ADELE	Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
LIZ	Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.

LIZ	Well, look who's dressing for success.
ADELE	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.

ADELE	And Flash isn't?
LIZ	Be nice.

ADELE	Peter-- you took this picture?
LIZ	Let me see.

BEN	Here you go, Pete.
PETER	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
BEN	What, want a glass?
PETER	No. No, that's okay.

BEN	So, uh... how's college goin'?
PETER	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
BEN	Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
PETER	You stop him?
BEN	Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
PETER	I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
BEN	Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.

BEN	Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
PETER	No
BEN	S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
PETER	Remember Little League?
BEN	Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.

BEN	Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
PETER	Oh, sure.
BEN	Cause if you get in a bind--
PETER	No, no.
BEN	Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
PETER	Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
BEN	-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...

BEN	When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
PETER	I know.
BEN	I'm always here, Pete.

HARRY	Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
FLASH	No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
HARRY	Flash, drop it--
FLASH	-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!

HARRY	I was there.
FLASH	See?
HARRY	Or was it all a dream?

FLASH	Lizzy!
LIZ	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
FLASH	I'm parked illegally!

FLASH	Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
LIZ	I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.

FLASH	Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
LIZ	Hm.  What a lump.

LIZ	Flash, get lost.
FLASH	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!

PETER	You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
HARRY	They'll never take me alive.

PETER	What's in there?
HARRY	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
PETER	Harry!

HARRY	Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
PETER	Harry
HARRY	Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.
PETER	Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.

HARRY	Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.
PETER	I know.  I've got one too.
HARRY	Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!

PETER	Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
HARRY	Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?

HARRY	You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
PETER	Don't be pitiful.
HARRY	I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!

HARRY	Jesus Christ.
PETER	Mm-hmm.
HARRY	And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
PETER	You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.

HARRY	You get mugged or something?
PETER	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
HARRY	I got you a present.

HARRY	Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
PETER	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
HARRY	Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.

PETER	Now tell me you love me.
HOGAN	Lemme down, bugface!
PETER	That's not even close.

PETER	Are you okay?
HOGAN	Get away from me, freak!

HOGAN	How are you doing, kid?
PETER	Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
HOGAN	You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
PETER	Right.

JAMESON	Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
PETER	I think you're trying to tell me something.

PETER	Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
JAMESON	You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--

PETER	You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
JAMESON	Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
PETER	Yeah--
JAMESON	Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
PETER	Can we make it a hundred?
JAMESON	Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.

PETER	Can't focus...
JAMESON	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.

JAMESON	I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
PETER	Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
JAMESON	I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
PETER	Mr. Jameson--
JAMESON	I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
PETER	Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
JAMESON	I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
PETER	You print pictures of Bigfoot!
JAMESON	Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
PETER	Mr. Jameson--
JAMESON	No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
PETER	Can I get a word in edgewise?
JAMESON	No!  Now get outta my face, kid.

SPIDER-MAN	Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
JAMESON	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
SPIDER-MAN	Would you cool it already?
JAMESON	Police, help!  Po-- mmph.

SPIDER-MAN	Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
JAMESON	Frmpph-yrr.
SPIDER-MAN	Fine.

SPIDER-MAN	Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
JAMESON	Hmf-hrr?

LEIBER	No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
PETER	Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
LEIBER	What's this? A cockaroach?
PETER	A spider.  Eight legs.

LEIBER	Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
PETER	How about tomorrow?
LEIBER	You're making my life difficult.
PETER	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
LEIBER	An even five I throw in the jacket.
PETER	Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.

LETTERMAN	Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
SPIDER-MAN	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
LETTERMAN	I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
SPIDER-MAN	Just call me Spidey.
LETTERMAN	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
SPIDER-MAN	Thanks, I already ate.
LETTERMAN	I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
SPIDER-MAN	Well...

LETTERMAN	All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...

LETTERMAN	Are you quite finished?
SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.

LIZ	He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
MAY	When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
LIZ	I don't think he wants me to find him.

MAY	Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
LIZ	He knew.
MAY	Some things you should say anyway.
LIZ	Even if they're not clever.
MAY	Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
LIZ	What if you get hurt?
MAY	What if the world ends tomorrow?

PETER	Good morning, Liz.
LIZ	How very dull, Peter Parker.
PETER	It's too early to be clever.

LIZ	It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
PETER	Huh?
LIZ	Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
PETER	I-- uh--
LIZ	Uh is a good start.
PETER	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
LIZ	Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.

PETER	I hate the Platonic idea of you.
LIZ	I hate people with alliterative names.
PETER	I hate--
LIZ	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.

LIZ	No.  I was lying about the coffee.
PETER	Thank God.

PETER	-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
LIZ	Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
PETER	Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.

LIZ	He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
PETER	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
LIZ	Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?

PETER	My my.
LIZ	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.

PETER	I suppose.
LIZ	You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
PETER	What?

LIZ	God, Flash can be such a jerk.
PETER	But you like that in a man?
LIZ	You should write that one down.
PETER	Flash, Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
LIZ	Some prep school thing.
PETER	Does it have a human name?
LIZ	Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
PETER	I'd never admit that.
LIZ	Hurry up, Flash!

LIZ	What are you doing this weekend?
PETER	I've gotta study.
LIZ	Oh. Maybe I should, too--

LIZ	Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
PETER	Hi, Adele.

LIZ	Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
PETER	I'm sure you kept warm.

PETER	Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
LIZ	What's your problem?
PETER	I've got no problems.

LIZ	Sit down and stop being such a child.
PETER	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
LIZ	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.

LIZ	What's in the bag?  Garbage?
PETER	Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
LIZ	Oh, don't do it on my account--
PETER	No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
LIZ	This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
PETER	That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.

PETER	-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
LIZ	Do you mind if I come too?
PETER	I think I'd like that.

PETER	They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
LIZ	You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
PETER	Well, no.
LIZ	So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
PETER	You'd feel what?
LIZ	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
PETER	Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
LIZ	I know what you mean.  I...

LIZ	Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
PETER	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.

PETER	I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
LIZ	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.

LIZ	May's much better. She'll be out soon.
PETER	Oh, God, I forgot to--
LIZ	Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
PETER	Strong...
LIZ	Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is

LIZ	Peter?
PETER	I'm here...

PETER	Hello, Liz.
LIZ	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
PETER	I... I like you.  A lot.
LIZ	Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--

PETER	Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
LIZ	Why?

LIZ	This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
PETER	Nah.

MAROTTA	You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
ROZ	So you've found Thorkel?
MAROTTA	Some of him

ROZ	Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
MAROTTA	But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
ROZ	Waldos.
MAROTTA	Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.

ROZ	Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
MAROTTA	Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
ROZ	There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.

MAROTTA	Toxic dumps, huh.
ROZ	And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
MAROTTA	You sure about all this?
ROZ	I know him.

ROZ	Of course.
MAROTTA	It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
ROZ	No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
MAROTTA	Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
ROZ	Peter-- my condolences.

MAROTTA	Yeah, Roz.
ROZ	Any sign of our friend?
MAROTTA	Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?

MAROTTA	Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
ROZ	Precise equipment

PETER	There's nothing in there worth stealing!
MAY	That's the understatement of the year.

PETER	Aunt May, you're trespassing.
MAY	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?

PETER	When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
MAY	Oh, Peter. A zit.

PETER	I am old enough to--
MAY	--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
PETER	I'll introduce you.
MAY	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
PETER	I'm a photographer, remember?
MAY	Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--

PETER	It's Friday night...
MAY	Yes.  Do you have a date?
PETER	No.

PETER	The record--
MAY	It'll shut itself off.

PETER	What the hell is that?
MAY	Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.

PETER	Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
MAY	You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.

MAY	Absolutely no class.
PETER	Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
MAY	Use a fork.

PETER	A match made in heaven.
MAY	See?  You big dullard.

MAY	Peter, you're bleeding.
PETER	It's fine.  Tell me what--
MAY	Oh, Ben gets through everything.
PETER	Aunt May, what happened?
MAY	I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
PETER	How is he?
MAY	He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.

NURSE VOICE	Poison emergency.
PETER	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
NURSE VOICE	Is this some sort of Zen thing?
PETER	I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
NURSE VOICE	Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
PETER	Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--

OCK	Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
THORKEL	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
OCK	Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
THORKEL	Let's talk in the hall.

OCK	In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
THORKEL	I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.

THORKEL	Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
OCK	I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--

THORKEL	What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
OCK	This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!

THORKEL	You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
OCK	I don't care.  Cretin.

THORKEL	That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
OCK	No!

THORKEL	Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering
OCK	I will finish what I've begun
THORKEL	Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.

ROZ	Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
OCK	Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
ROZ	Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.

OCK	No.  No thank you.  I have work.
ROZ	I heard about Thorkel's order--
OCK	I left a paper in my desk.

ROZ	A bit melodramatic
OCK	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.

OCK	My
ROZ	All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
OCK	You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.

ROZ	Creation? Or its opposite?
OCK	Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.

ROZ	Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
OCK	I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
ROZ	No. It isn't.

ROZ	Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
OCK	Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.

ROZ	My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
OCK	Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
ROZ	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!

ROZ	Mr. Parker.
PETER	Hi, Professor.  What's up?

ROZ	Peter, what can I do for you?
PETER	An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
ROZ	Your dog ate it.
PETER	Actually, I got this spider bite
ROZ	Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
PETER	Really, Professor, I--

ROZ	Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
PETER	Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
ROZ	How much do you know about it?
PETER	Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
ROZ	Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.

PETER	Need any more help?
ROZ	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.

ROZ	This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
PETER	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
ROZ	Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
PETER	I don't think I'll be running into him.
ROZ	You never know.  Go get some sleep.
PETER	I'll try. Thanks.

ROZ	The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
PETER	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
ROZ	If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.

REISS	Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
PETER	Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--

PETER	Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
REISS	I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
PETER	No
REISS	Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
PETER	Why? It is a wrestling match, or
REISS	Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.

REISS	Where'd you get the clown suit?
SPIDER-MAN	Like it?
REISS	Nah.  The big mask was better.

SPIDER-MAN	So they're airing this tonight?
REISS	Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.

REISS	... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
SPIDER-MAN	What?
REISS	I asked if you felt like a drink--
SPIDER-MAN	No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
REISS	Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.

SPIDER-MAN	Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
REISS	I just gave-- yeah, sure.

ROZ	I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
SPIDER-MAN	Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
ROZ	Right.  Let's go.

ROZ	You're sure you're all right.
SPIDER-MAN	Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
ROZ	Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
SPIDER-MAN	Imagine how I feel.
ROZ	Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become
SPIDER-MAN	The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
ROZ	He'll try to finish his experiment.
SPIDER-MAN	And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
ROZ	A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
SPIDER-MAN	Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.

ROZ	I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
SPIDER-MAN	Bonkers.
ROZ	Loonytunes.  And yet...
SPIDER-MAN	Just drop me off here.

ROZ	Do you... live around here?
SPIDER-MAN	No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
ROZ	I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
SPIDER-MAN	Phooey on that.

ROZ	Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
SPIDER-MAN	I'm not so happy myself.

SPIDER-MAN	Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
ROZ	Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--

SPIDER-MAN	Up here, Docky Ocky!
ROZ	No, no!  Not there!

B'ETOR	Toh-pak-cha=8A 
LURSA	HoS qorDu. 

B'ETOR	The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
LURSA	We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.

LURSA	It's working.
B'ETOR	Where is he?

B'ETOR	I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
LURSA	He is.
B'ETOR	Then when is he going to Engineering?

LURSA	Where is he now?
B'ETOR	I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!

LURSA	Target their Bridge.
B'ETOR	Full disruptors.

CHEKOV	Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
KIRK	Thanks for pointing that out.

KIRK	Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
CHEKOV	Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.

CHEKOV	Captain=8A
KIRK	I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.

KIRK	But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
CHEKOV	Twelve years, sir.
KIRK	Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.

DATA	According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
PICARD	When is it expected back?

PICARD	Data?
DATA	Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.

PICARD	Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
DATA	The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
PICARD	Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
DATA	It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.

PICARD	Data, are you all right?
DATA	No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
PICARD	What do you mean?
DATA	I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.

PICARD	Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
DATA	But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
PICARD	No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
DATA	Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.

DATA	According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
PICARD	Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
DATA	The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.

DATA	This is its current position.
PICARD	Can you project its course?

PICARD	Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
DATA	I believe so.

PICARD	Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
DATA	I believe so.

PICARD	He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
DATA	Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.

PICARD	That's where he's going.
DATA	It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
PICARD	And destroy every planet in the system.

PICARD	Are any of them inhabited?
DATA	Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
PICARD	Population?
DATA	Approximately two hundred thirty million.

DATA	Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-
PICARD	Commander.
DATA	Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.

DATA	Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
PICARD	I have to find a way to get to Soran.

DATA	Is she still angry?
LA FORGE	No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
DATA	I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.

LA FORGE	Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
DATA	It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
LA FORGE	Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
DATA	That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.

LA FORGE	But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
DATA	Agreed.

LA FORGE	Well?
DATA	I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
LA FORGE	Really? What do you feel?
DATA	I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.

DATA	I get it. I get it.
LA FORGE	You get what?

LA FORGE	What?
DATA	During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
LA FORGE	The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
DATA	I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
LA FORGE	Thanks.

LA FORGE	I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
DATA	It appears to be a magnetically sealed.

LA FORGE	Data, this isn't the time.
DATA	I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong

LA FORGE	Data, are you all right?
DATA	I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
LA FORGE	We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.

LA FORGE	That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
DATA	One minute to warp core breach.

DATA	Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
RIKER	The station complement was nineteen.

RIKER	Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
DATA	I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
RIKER	We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
DATA	I hope so, sir.

RIKER	Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
DATA	Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.

DATA	I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
RIKER	All hands, brace for impact!

HARRIMAN	Can you locate them?
DEMORA	The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
HARRIMAN	Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.

DEMORA	We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
HARRIMAN	On screen.

DEMORA	We're within range, sir.
HARRIMAN	Beam them directly to Sickbay.

DEMORA	Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
HARRIMAN	I'll go. You have the Bridge.

HARRIMAN	You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
DEMORA	There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.

PICARD	Do you remember him?
GUINAN	Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.

PICARD	Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
GUINAN	Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
PICARD	What's the "Nexus"?

GUINAN	That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
PICARD	What happened to you?
GUINAN	I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.

GUINAN	It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
PICARD	Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
GUINAN	Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
PICARD	But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.

PICARD	Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
GUINAN	You're in the Nexus.

PICARD	This is the Nexus?
GUINAN	For you. This is where you wanted to be.
PICARD	But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
GUINAN	Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.

PICARD	Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
GUINAN	I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
PICARD	Left behind?
GUINAN	When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
PICARD	Soran?
GUINAN	All of us.
PICARD	Where is he now?
GUINAN	Wherever he wanted to be.

PICARD	These are my children...my children.
GUINAN	Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.

PICARD	Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
GUINAN	Why would you want to leave?
PICARD	Can I?
GUINAN	Yes, where would you go?
PICARD	I don't understand.
GUINAN	I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.

PICARD	I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
GUINAN	What makes you think things will be any different this time?
PICARD	You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
GUINAN	I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?

HARRIMAN	I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
KIRK	It's our pleasure.

KIRK	Well, may we have a look around?
HARRIMAN	Please, please.

HARRIMAN	Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
KIRK	Oh, of course.

HARRIMAN	Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
KIRK	No, no. Thank you.
HARRIMAN	Please, I insist.

HARRIMAN	We don't have a tractor beam.
KIRK	You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
HARRIMAN	It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.

HARRIMAN	What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
KIRK	Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.

KIRK	Beautiful day, isn't it?
PICARD	Yes, yes, it is.

KIRK	This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
PICARD	I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.

KIRK	So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
PICARD	Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
KIRK	Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.

KIRK	You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
PICARD	You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
KIRK	I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.

KIRK	No, no, it's not. It's better.
PICARD	Better?
KIRK	This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.

PICARD	Antonia?
KIRK	She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

KIRK	Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
PICARD	That's right.
KIRK	Close to retirement?
PICARD	I hadn't planned on it.

KIRK	How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
PICARD	That's right.
KIRK	I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
PICARD	You could say that.
KIRK	Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.

PICARD	I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
KIRK	Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
PICARD	Yes.  Thank you.
KIRK	Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.

KIRK	Oh
SCOTTY	I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.

KIRK	I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
SCOTTY	What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
KIRK	When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.

KIRK	You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
SCOTTY	And what would that be, sir?
KIRK	Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
SCOTTY	It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

SCOTTY	Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
KIRK	Phasing? To where?

KIRK	The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
SCOTTY	There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!

SCOTTY	But I do have a theory...
KIRK	I thought you might.
SCOTTY	An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
KIRK	A photon torpedo?
SCOTTY	Aye.
KIRK	Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.

SCOTTY	Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
KIRK	Where are the deflector relays?

KIRK	Keep her together until I get back.
SCOTTY	I always do.

KIRK	Kirk here.
SCOTTY	Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!

SORAN	A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
LA FORGE	What's normal?
SORAN	Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
LA FORGE	What do you want?

SORAN	I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
LA FORGE	I was ordered to by the Captain.

SORAN	Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
LA FORGE	No.
SORAN	What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
LA FORGE	Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

SORAN	Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
LA FORGE	Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
SORAN	I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
LA FORGE	No, I didn't know that.
SORAN	We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
LA FORGE	I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.

PICARD	Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
RIKER	When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?

PICARD	Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
RIKER	Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.

PICARD	Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
RIKER	Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.

RIKER	Sir?
PICARD	Make it so.

PICARD	There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
RIKER	We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
PICARD	Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
RIKER	You want me to contact Starfleet?
PICARD	Is there a problem?
RIKER	No, sir.
PICARD	Thank you, Number One.

RIKER	There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
PICARD	Understood. That will be all.
RIKER	Sir, is there anything wrong?
PICARD	No. Thank you.

PICARD	Report.
RIKER	A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
PICARD	How is that possible?

RIKER	Maybe they're not out there.
PICARD	They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.

RIKER	That's a pretty big margin of error.
PICARD	Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?

RIKER	I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
PICARD	You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.

TROI	Captain, are you all right?
PICARD	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.

PICARD	Counselor. What can I do for you?
TROI	Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
PICARD	Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.

TROI	I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
PICARD	As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
TROI	You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.

PICARD	Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
TROI	Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
PICARD	All right, all right. You've made your point.

TROI	Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
PICARD	What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.

TROI	It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
PICARD	In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.

TROI	Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
PICARD	Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...

TROI	You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
PICARD	My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
TROI	There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.

TROI	Or perhaps they're on the surface.
PICARD	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.

PICARD	Doctor Soran?
SORAN	Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

PICARD	Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
SORAN	Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.

PICARD	Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
SORAN	The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
PICARD	We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...

SORAN	You must think I'm quite the madman.
PICARD	The thought had crossed my mind.
SORAN	The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.

SORAN	I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
PICARD	Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?

PICARD	We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
SORAN	What if I told you I found a new truth?
PICARD	The Nexus.
SORAN	Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.

SORAN	Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
PICARD	Thank you.

WORF	The royal...studs?
RIKER	You see the top yardarm, now look to the-

RIKER	It looks like we're too late.
WORF	There are no other ships in the system.

WORF	These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
RIKER	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.

WORF	One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
RIKER	Trilithium?
WORF	An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
RIKER	Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.

RIKER	Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
WORF	Aye, sir.

WORF	Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
RIKER	The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.

WORF	I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
RIKER	Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?

WORF	They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
RIKER	Lock phasers and return fire!

WORF	It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
RIKER	Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
WORF	I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.

WORF	As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
RIKER	Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.

RIKER	Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
WORF	Aye, sir.
RIKER	We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.

STYLES	Status!
1ST OFFICER	All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
STYLES	Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.

1ST OFFICER	Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
STYLES	And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
1ST OFFICER	Tractor beam, aye!
STYLES	If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...

1ST OFFICER	Transwarp at your command, Sir!
STYLES	Execute!

CAPTAIN	Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
WOMAN	He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
CAPTAIN	Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
WOMAN	Put me on the hailing frequency.
CAPTAIN	Sure - whatever games you wanna play.

CAPTAIN	What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
WOMAN	Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  

KIRK	Mr. Chekov -- ?
CHEKOV	An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
KIRK	Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
CHEKOV	Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.

CHEKOV	Will we get another ship?
KIRK	I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

CHEKOV	Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
KIRK	Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

KIRK	Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
CHEKOV	Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.

KIRK	Calm yourself, Bones.
CHEKOV	Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
KIRK	No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...

CHEKOV	Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
KIRK	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.

KIRK	You did great, Bones... Just great.
CHEKOV	Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
KIRK	Response?
CHEKOV	Nothing. As before.
KIRK	What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
CHEKOV	Aye, sir.

CHEKOV	Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
KIRK	Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.

CHEKOV	Still no response, sir.
KIRK	Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?

CHEKOV	I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
KIRK	What did you see, Chekov?
CHEKOV	For an instant... A scout class vessel.
KIRK	Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.

CHEKOV	Nothing on my scanner, sir.
KIRK	Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.

CHEKOV	Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
KIRK	Scotty...?

COMM OFFICER	Aye sir, coding now.
ESTEBAN	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.

COMM OFFICER	Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
ESTEBAN	Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...

COMM OFFICER	Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
ESTEBAN	Locate.
COMM OFFICER	Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
ESTEBAN	On screen.

ESTEBAN	Could it be Spock's?
DAVID	It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
ESTEBAN	In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.

DAVID	I don't believe it...
ESTEBAN	What is it?

DAVID	Why don't we beam it up?
ESTEBAN	Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
DAVID	Not from here, no.

ESTEBAN	All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
DAVID	Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!

DAVID	Hello, sir. It's David.
KIRK	David... Sorry I'm late.
DAVID	It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
KIRK	David!... What went wrong?
DAVID	I went wrong.

KIRK	David, I don't understand...
DAVID	I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --

DAVID	This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
SAAVIK	Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
DAVID	Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
SAAVIK	Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
DAVID	It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
SAAVIK	... Fascinating.
DAVID	All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
SAAVIK	You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
DAVID	It's a little early to celebrate.

SAAVIK	Same sector. Metallic mass.
DAVID	Underground deposit?
SAAVIK	Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
DAVID	There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.

SAAVIK	Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
DAVID	A photon tube...!

SAAVIK	New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
DAVID	Short range scan.
SAAVIK	As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
DAVID	Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
SAAVIK	... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...

DAVID	There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
SAAVIK	Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.

DAVID	Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
SAAVIK	... Or <u>who</u>.

SAAVIK	Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
DAVID	I'll handle that later.
SAAVIK	My readings indicate great instability.
DAVID	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!

DAVID	.          .. Spock's tube...
SAAVIK	David --

DAVID	Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
SAAVIK	But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?

DAVID	What is it?
SAAVIK	Spock's burial robe.

DAVID	Later. Let's go...
SAAVIK	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.

DAVID	Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
SAAVIK	It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
DAVID	You mean, we're stranded down here?!
SAAVIK	Logic indicates that is the case.
DAVID	How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
SAAVIK	That may be difficult...
DAVID	Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
SAAVIK	I have already made one transmission too many...

SAAVIK	It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
DAVID	Not exactly.
SAAVIK	Why?
DAVID	I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
SAAVIK	Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
DAVID	It was the only way to solve certain problems --
SAAVIK	Did your collaborator know?
DAVID	My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
SAAVIK	So, like your father, you changed the rules...
DAVID	If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
SAAVIK	And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?

DAVID	This planet is aging in surges.
SAAVIK	And Spock with it. They are joined together.

DAVID	The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
SAAVIK	... How long?
DAVID	Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
SAAVIK	It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
DAVID	I don't understand.
SAAVIK	Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
DAVID	I still don't...

DAVID	Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
SAAVIK	I'll go...
DAVID	No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.

SAAVIK	If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
ESTEBAN	You said there wouldn't be any.

SAAVIK	Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
ESTEBAN	... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger. I know the book, Saavik.

ESTEBAN	Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
SAAVIK	Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
ESTEBAN	Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
SAAVIK	I'll try to remember that, Captain.

SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
ESTEBAN	We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
SAAVIK	Do you have an explanation?

SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
ESTEBAN	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...

ESTEBAN	Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
SAAVIK	Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
ESTEBAN	Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
SAAVIK	None that I can detect, sir.
ESTEBAN	Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.

SAAVIK	I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
ESTEBAN	I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.

SAAVIK	Captain, what's happening?!
ESTEBAN	We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --

SCOTTY	I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
KIRK	Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
SCOTTY	Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
KIRK	Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
SCOTTY	Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
KIRK	Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.

KIRK	Mr. Scott...
SCOTTY	I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
KIRK	Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.

SCOTTY	As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
KIRK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.

KIRK	Mr. Scott?
SCOTTY	I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
KIRK	Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!

KIRK	Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY	Sir...?
KIRK	The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!

SCOTTY	Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
KIRK	Scan for vessels in pursuit!

KIRK	Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
SCOTTY	Aye, sir!

KIRK	Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
SCOTTY	Aye, sir!

KIRK	Good shooting, Scotty.
SCOTTY	Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
KIRK	Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...

KIRK	I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
SCOTTY	Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
KIRK	What's wrong?
SCOTTY	They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!

KIRK	How many more?
SCOTTY	Just him, sir!
KIRK	Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!

SAAVIK	Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
KIRK	Saavik... Is... David with you?
SAAVIK	Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
KIRK	This Vulcan -- is he alive?
SAAVIK	He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.

KIRK	What happened...?
SAAVIK	He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.

KIRK	Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
SAAVIK	Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...

SAAVIK	The Genesis planet is gone.
KIRK	Goodbye, David.

SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
KIRK	What? What are you saying?
SAAVIK	The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
KIRK	But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
SAAVIK	Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
KIRK	And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
SAAVIK	. He will remain always as he is.

KIRK	My God...
SAAVIK	Much is at stake...

SPOCK	I know you... Do I not?
KIRK	Yes. And I know you.
SPOCK	My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
KIRK	You would have done the same for me.
SPOCK	Why would you do this...?
KIRK	Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.

KIRK	Yes, yes, Spock...
SPOCK	The ship... Out of danger...?
KIRK	You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!

SULU	On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
KIRK	Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.

SULU	... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
KIRK	She's to be decommissioned.

SULU	The word, sir?
KIRK	The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
SULU	Count on our help, sir.
KIRK	I'll need it, Sulu.

SULU	... We have cleared Spacedoors.
KIRK	FULL IMPULSE POWER!

KIRK	Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
SULU	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...

SULU	Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
KIRK	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.

SULU	Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
KIRK	Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?

SULU	We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
KIRK	What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?

KIRK	See! That shimmering area.
SULU	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

KIRK	That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
SULU	I think it's an energy form, sir...
KIRK	Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
SULU	... A cloaking device?
KIRK	Red alert, Mr. Scott.

SULU	Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
KIRK	Fire, Mr. Scott!

KIRK	Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
SULU	About a dozen officers and men.
KIRK	With some on the planet...

SULU	Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
KIRK	What about surface life signs...?
SULU	Close... There --
KIRK	Come on!

SULU	If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
KIRK	Go, Sulu!

SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
KIRK	Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.

SULU	The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
KIRK	Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.

KIRK	Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
SULU	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!

KIRK	Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
UHURA	No, sir, no response.
KIRK	Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?

KIRK	Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
UHURA	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.

UHURA	Would you look at that?
KIRK	My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...

UHURA	How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
KIRK	That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.

UHURA	Gentlemen. Good evening.
KIRK	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
UHURA	Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.

KIRK	Will you be able to handle that...?
UHURA	Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.

KIRK	Welcome aboard, Admiral.
MORROW	Welcome home, Jim.

MORROW	Where's Doctor McCoy?
KIRK	Indisposed, sir.
MORROW	Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.

KIRK	Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
MORROW	Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
KIRK	But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
MORROW	Genesis?! Whatever for?
KIRK	Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
MORROW	That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
KIRK	May I ask why...?
MORROW	Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.

MORROW	Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
KIRK	Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
MORROW	Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
KIRK	Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
MORROW	Yours...?!
KIRK	As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
MORROW	No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
KIRK	Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
MORROW	Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
KIRK	Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!

KIRK	Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
MORROW	Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
KIRK	You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
MORROW	Any time.

KIRK	I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
KRUGE	Report status!

KIRK	Torpedoes coming in -- !

KRUGE	Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
KIRK	Who is this?! How dare you --
KRUGE	Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.

KIRK	David?... David!
KRUGE	Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
KIRK	Wait! Give me a chance --

KRUGE	There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
KIRK	All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.

KIRK	Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
KRUGE	No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
KIRK	No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.

KRUGE	Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
KIRK	You should take the Vulcan, too.
KRUGE	No.
KIRK	But, why?
KRUGE	Because you wish it.  

KRUGE	Genesis, I want it.
KIRK	Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
KRUGE	Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
KIRK	You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
KRUGE	Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
KIRK	If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
KRUGE	Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!

KIRK	Give me your hand and we both live.
KIRK	Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!

KIRK	Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
SAREK	I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

KIRK	Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
SAREK	Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
KIRK	Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
SAREK	Met his death?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
KIRK	I -- saw no future --
SAREK	You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
KIRK	Yes, I was...
SAREK	Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
KIRK	But -- why?
SAREK	Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
KIRK	Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
SAREK	He would not have spoken of it openly.
KIRK	Then, how --
SAREK	Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
KIRK	Of course...!

SAREK	... He spoke of your friendship.
KIRK	Yes...
SAREK	He asked you not to grieve...
KIRK	... Yes...
SAREK	... The needs of the many outweigh...
KIRK	... The needs of the few...
SAREK	... Or the one.
KIRK	... Spock...
SAREK	I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
KIRK	... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
SAREK	Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
KIRK	But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
SAREK	I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.

KIRK	Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
SAREK	Yes... But -- how...?
KIRK	Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!

KIRK	Bones!...
SAREK	One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
KIRK	What must I do?
SAREK	You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
KIRK	What you ask is difficult.
SAREK	You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.

KIRK	What about Spock?
SAREK	I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
KIRK	What I have done, I had to do.
SAREK	But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
KIRK	If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.

KRUGE	So!  Speak!
TORG	Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.

KRUGE	Share this with no one.
TORG	Understood, my lord.
KRUGE	We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
TORG	Success, my lord.
KRUGE	Station!

TORG	Sir, may I suggest --
KRUGE	Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
TORG	I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

KRUGE	I ordered no interruptions.
TORG	But sir! Federation Starship approaching.

TORG	We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
KRUGE	Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.

KRUGE	Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
TORG	Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
KRUGE	They know we would die first.

TORG	How can you tell that?
KRUGE	I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.

KRUGE	I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
TORG	They outnumber us, my Lord --
KRUGE	<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!

KRUGE	I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
MALTZ	Yes, my lord!

MALTZ	Range: 3000 Kellicams.
KRUGE	Steady. Continue on impulse power.

MALTZ	Firing range, sir.

MALTZ	1,000 Kellicams, closing!
KRUGE	Wait!... Wait...

MALTZ	500 Kellicams!

MALTZ	My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
KRUGE	Put him on screen!  Study him well.

MALTZ	My Lord... what are your orders?
KRUGE	I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
MALTZ	Sir, may I --
KRUGE	Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
MALTZ	We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
KRUGE	They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
MALTZ	But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
KRUGE	Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.

LIEUTENANT	You amaze me, Commander.
UHURA	How is that...?
LIEUTENANT	A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
UHURA	Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT	Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
UHURA	You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.

LIEUTENANT	Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
UHURA	Good for you, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT	But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
UHURA	All true.
LIEUTENANT	Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
UHURA	I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
LIEUTENANT	The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
UHURA	This isn't reality. This is fantasy.

PICARD	We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
ANIJ	It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.

PICARD	My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
ANIJ	Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
PICARD	If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...

PICARD	You have warp capability?
ANIJ	Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?

PICARD	I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
ANIJ	Why?
PICARD	I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
ANIJ	Then you must spend your life answering questions.

ANIJ	I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
PICARD	Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...

ANIJ	Deceive us?
PICARD	To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

PICARD	Don't panic...
ANIJ	I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?

ANIJ	There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
PICARD	We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.

PICARD	Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
ANIJ	We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
PICARD	Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
ANIJ	But not you.
PICARD	There are days.
ANIJ	You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
PICARD	In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
ANIJ	... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
PICARD	You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.

PICARD	The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
ANIJ	This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
PICARD	An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
ANIJ	More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
PICARD	Will it?
ANIJ	You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
PICARD	A perfect moment?
ANIJ	When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
PICARD	Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
ANIJ	Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
PICARD	I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
ANIJ	It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

PICARD	There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
ANIJ	I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

ANIJ	I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
PICARD	... an offlander?
ANIJ	For someone so young.

PICARD	When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
ANIJ	There are caves in those mountains.
PICARD	We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...

ANIJ	Jak'tahla?
PICARD	Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...

ANIJ	Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
PICARD	By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.

PICARD	How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
ANIJ	What's the rush?
PICARD	I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...

ANIJ	There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
PICARD	This way!

ANIJ	You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
PICARD	You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.

ANIJ	Mother and son. You arranged this...?
PICARD	I thought it might begin the healing process.

PICARD	But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
ANIJ	I'll be here.

ANIJ	Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
PICARD	The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...

DATA	There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
ARTIM	You're what?
DATA	I am better.

ARTIM	My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
DATA	I understand.
ARTIM	I don't.

ARTIM	Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
DATA	I aspire to be more than I am.
ARTIM	I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
DATA	Perhaps, that is true.

ARTIM	Don't you ever get tired?
DATA	My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
ARTIM	I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.

DATA	Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
ARTIM	Really?
DATA	Really.
ARTIM	For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
DATA	But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
ARTIM	Sometimes I do.
DATA	My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...

ARTIM	But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
DATA	I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
ARTIM	Do machines ever play?
DATA	I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
ARTIM	No, I mean...

ARTIM	Chase me!
DATA	For what purpose?
ARTIM	Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
DATA	But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
ARTIM	Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
DATA	Androids... don't have...fun.
ARTIM	Why not...?
DATA	No one's ever asked me that before.
ARTIM	If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...

ARTIM	Anij!
DATA	Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
ARTIM	No... I want to stay with you...
DATA	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.

DATA	I have to go home now.
ARTIM	Bye.

ARTIM	Can he breathe under water?
PICARD	Data doesn't breathe.
ARTIM	Won't he rust?
PICARD	No.

PICARD	To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
ARTIM	The artificial lifeform was right?
PICARD	If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.

CRUSHER	Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
PICARD'S COM VOICE	And our people?
CRUSHER	They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
PICARD'S COM VOICE	Are they in any danger?
CRUSHER	Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
PICARD'S COM VOICE	Very good, Doctor. Picard out.

CRUSHER	You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
CRUSHER	Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.

PICARD	Very funny...
CRUSHER	Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...

PICARD	Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
CRUSHER	They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.

PICARD	Will he live?
CRUSHER	Yes. But look at this medscan...

CRUSHER	She's stabilizing.
PICARD	Is it safe to move her?
CRUSHER	Safer than leaving her here.

PICARD	Hello, Data...
DATA	Captain, Geordi...?
PICARD	You're aboard the Enterprise.

DATA	Yes... that looks like them.
PICARD	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
DATA	'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
PICARD	From the mission...
DATA	I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...

DATA	I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
PICARD	It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
DATA	... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
PICARD	Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
DATA	And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.

DATA	Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
PICARD	How about a passive radiation scan?

PICARD	A ship,
DATA	It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
PICARD	'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'

DATA	Incomplete, I might add.
PICARD	What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...

DATA	... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
PICARD	What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...

DATA	Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
PICARD	I don't know.

DATA	Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
PICARD	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...

PICARD	How many?
DATA	Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...

DATA	I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
PICARD	Will the structure hold if we blast through?
DATA	I believe it is safe, sir.

RU'AFO	Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
DOUGHERTY	Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
RU'AFO	Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.

RU'AFO	Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
DOUGHERTY	Another time.

RU'AFO	Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
DOUGHERTY	I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...

RU'AFO	Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
DOUGHERTY	I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...

RU'AFO	It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
DOUGHERTY	He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...

DOUGHERTY	Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
RU'AFO	Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
DOUGHERTY	That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
RU'AFO	Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?

DOUGHERTY	I'll order Riker to turn around.
RU'AFO	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?

DOUGHERTY	You're not going to launch anything until...
RU'AFO	In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.

DOUGHERTY	We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
RU'AFO	It is not over.
DOUGHERTY	It is over.

RU'AFO	I do not take orders from you.
DOUGHERTY	If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...

PICARD	You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
DOUGHERTY	... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
PICARD	The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
DOUGHERTY	That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
PICARD	What kind of concerns?
DOUGHERTY	We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.

DOUGHERTY	Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
PICARD	This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
DOUGHERTY	I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
PICARD	Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...

DOUGHERTY	All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
PICARD	Understood.
DOUGHERTY	Good luck. Dougherty out.

PICARD	... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
DOUGHERTY	You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
PICARD	In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
DOUGHERTY	I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
PICARD	You're not finished here?
DOUGHERTY	Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.

DOUGHERTY	You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
PICARD	Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
DOUGHERTY	That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
PICARD	... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
DOUGHERTY	I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
PICARD	How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
DOUGHERTY	The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
PICARD	Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
DOUGHERTY	There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
PICARD	A planet in Federation space...
DOUGHERTY	Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
PICARD	Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
DOUGHERTY	On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
PICARD	Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
DOUGHERTY	With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
PICARD	There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
DOUGHERTY	The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
PICARD	Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
DOUGHERTY	Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
PICARD	Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
DOUGHERTY	It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
PICARD	The Ba'ku.

PICARD	We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
DOUGHERTY	We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
PICARD	How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?

DOUGHERTY	Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
PICARD	If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.

PICARD	I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
DOUGHERTY	There's nothing further to be gained from this...

PICARD	A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
GALLATIN	Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
PICARD	I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.

GALLATIN	What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
PICARD	Do you know how to disable the injector?
GALLATIN	But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
PICARD	If we could lure him away from the bridge...
GALLATIN	It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
PICARD	What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...

GALLATIN	The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
PICARD	Scan for lifesigns.

RU'AFO	Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
GALLATIN	No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
RU'AFO	I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.

RU'AFO	The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
GALLATIN	Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
RU'AFO	We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.

GALLATIN	They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
RU'AFO	Recommendations?

GALLATIN	There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
RU'AFO	We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...

RU'AFO	Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
GALLATIN	May I talk to you alone?
RU'AFO	Deploy the collector.

GALLATIN	Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
RU'AFO	No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...

RU'AFO	Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
GALLATIN	The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
RU'AFO	Thank-you for reminding me.

PICARD	I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
LA FORGE	They... are in opposite directions, sir...
PICARD	Are they...?

LA FORGE	We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
PICARD	Do you have everything you need from command?

LA FORGE	The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
PICARD	When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...

LA FORGE	I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
PICARD	Do you know how they were damaged?
LA FORGE	By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
PICARD	The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
LA FORGE	I don't believe it happened that way.
PICARD	Why would they fire at him without provocation?
LA FORGE	All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
PICARD	Fail-safe?
LA FORGE	His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
PICARD	So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
LA FORGE	In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
PICARD	And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...

PICARD	Implants bothering you?
LA FORGE	It's nothing. I'm just tired.

LA FORGE	Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
PICARD	... had regenerated.
LA FORGE	It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.

RIKER	A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
LA FORGE	I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.

RIKER	Full impulse.
LA FORGE	The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
RIKER	If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
LA FORGE	I'll be in Engineering.

RIKER	Will that stop the tear?
LA FORGE	You got me, Commander.
RIKER	That's your expert opinion?
LA FORGE	Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.

LA FORGE	We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
RIKER'S COM VOICE	Options?
LA FORGE	Eject the core.

LA FORGE	Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
RIKER'S COM VOICE	Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
LA FORGE	The purpose being...?

LA FORGE	I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
RIKER'S COM VOICE	If it works you mean.
LA FORGE	Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.

NARA	I don't think they believe us.
RIKER	Why not?

NARA	Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
RIKER	On screen.

NARA	The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
RIKER	Eject the core.

RIKER	The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
NARA	Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
RIKER	It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.

PERIM	Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
RIKER	How long 'til they reach us?
PERIM	Eighteen minutes...

RIKER	What's inside that nebula cluster?
PERIM	Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
RIKER	Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.

PERIM	I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
RIKER	Remind me to lodge a protest...

PERIM	We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
RIKER	We're through running from these bastards.

PERIM	They're powering their forward weapons array.
RIKER	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.

RIKER	They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
PICARD	We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
RIKER	The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
PICARD	... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
RIKER	Deck ten.

PICARD	Who is it?
RIKER	Commander Riker...

RIKER	... and gorgonzolla cheese.
PICARD	We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
RIKER	Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
PICARD	So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
RIKER	The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...

RIKER	Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
PICARD	We're not going anywhere.

PICARD	Deck five.
RIKER	You Klingons never do anything small, do you...

PICARD	Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
RIKER	Aye, sir.

RIKER	You must be planning on doing some hunting.
PICARD	Go back to your quarters  That's an order.

PICARD	There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
RIKER	Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...

RIKER	The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
PICARD	Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...

SOJEF	My name is Sojef, Captain.
PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
SOJEF	Would you like something to eat?
PICARD	No, we're here to... rescue them.
SOJEF	As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.

SOJEF	We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
PICARD	You've not aged a day since then?
SOJEF	Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.

SOJEF	I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
PICARD	Ask them.
SOJEF	I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.

WORF'S COM VOICE	Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
PICARD	Slow to impulse. We're on our way.

WORF'S COM VOICE	I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
PICARD	We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.

WORF'S COM VOICE	Worf to Picard...
PICARD	Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
WORF'S COM VOICE	We're trying to get to you, sir...

PICARD	Worf, you must hurry...
WORF'S COM VOICE	We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
PICARD	I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...

WORF	Captain...
PICARD	Worf, what the hell are you doing here?

WORF	I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
PICARD	It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.

WORF	Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
PICARD	Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
WORF	He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
PICARD	The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...

PICARD	Come out, come out wherever you are...
WORF	Sir?
PICARD	Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...

WORF	Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
PICARD	Make it so.

WORF	Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
PICARD	Beam him out!

WORF	He's activated a transport inhibitor.
PICARD	Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...

WORF	Scanners are off line!
PICARD	Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...

PICARD	Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
WORF	No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
PICARD	They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."

WORF	Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
PICARD	I'm not letting go of him.

WORF	The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
PICARD	Transferring controls to manual.

PICARD	Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
WORF	No, sir...
PICARD	Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
WORF	No, sir. It is a gorch.
PICARD	Gorch?

WORF	Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
PICARD	Picard to Crusher...

WORF	Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
PICARD	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.

PICARD	You need a haircut, Commander.
WORF	Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...

WORF	The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
PICARD	Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...

WORF	Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
PICARD	We have to find shelter...

WORF	All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
PICARD	Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.

WORF	One. It's Ru'afo.
PICARD	Can you beam him off?
WORF	Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
PICARD	Is there any other way to disable the injector?

TROI	... Population three hundred million...
PICARD	Say the greeting again...
TROI	Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...

TROI	Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
PICARD	Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...

TROI	We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
PICARD	You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.

PICARD	Counselor?
TROI	They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...

TROI	The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
RIKER	Why was Data assigned?
TROI	Environmental concerns, again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...

RIKER	I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
TROI	What are they interested in...?
RIKER	Wine, women and song.
TROI	You should feel right at home with them.

RIKER	Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
TROI	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
RIKER	You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.

TROI	Why would we be involved with these people?
RIKER	Good question.

RIKER	You haven't done that in a long time...
TROI	What...?
RIKER	What you're doing to my neck...
TROI	Was I doing something to your neck?

RIKER	It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
TROI	No children?
RIKER	If that's true, they're a dying race.

TROI	Come in.  Hi.
RIKER	Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
TROI	Whatever makes you comfortable...

TROI	This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
RIKER	But it's comfortable.
TROI	Why don't you try sitting up?
RIKER	Or you could try lying down.
TROI	You're in quite a mood today.

RIKER	Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
TROI	... I believe you...
RIKER	... I'm not sleeping well...
TROI	... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...

RIKER	What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
TROI	On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.

TROI	Augh.
RIKER	Augh?
TROI	I never kissed you with a beard before.

RIKER	All hands. Battle stations!
TROI	And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?

RU'AFO	Initiate launch sequence.
SON'A OFFICER #2	Activating injector assembly.

RU'AFO	Exactly as the simulations predicted...
SON'A OFFICER #2	Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
RU'AFO	Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
SON'A OFFICER #2	All ship functions are off-line.

RU'AFO	This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
SON'A OFFICER #2	They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
RU'AFO	Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...

ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President.
PRESIDENT	Admiral Donald...Bill...
ADMIRAL DONALD	Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
PRESIDENT	At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.

PRESIDENT	I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
ADMIRAL DONALD	The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT	I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.

SPOCK	Good luck, Captain.
BONES	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.

BONES	I believe the operation is over.
SPOCK	The charge is murder.

BONES	I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
SPOCK	You may need assistance, doctor...
BONES	Fascinating...

BONES	Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
SPOCK	Vulcans sleep lying down...

BONES	Spock, that was actually funny.
SPOCK	We DO sleep lying down.

SPOCK	Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
BONES	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!

BONES	Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
SPOCK	We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...

SPOCK	Or not to be -
BONES	That's the question -

BONES	Uh, Jim...
KIRK	You heard the order, Lieutenant.

BONES	What the Hell's going on?
KIRK	I wish I knew. Uhura?

BONES	Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
KIRK	Can you - ?
BONES	Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.

KIRK	No!
BONES	Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?

KIRK	Thanks...
BONES	What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?

BONES	Figures.
KIRK	We've been set up all along.

KIRK	Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
BONES	Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?

BONES	Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
KIRK	We're not finished.
BONES	Speak for yourself. One day... one night...

BONES	- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
KIRK	Bones, are you afraid of the future?
BONES	That was the general idea I intended to convey.
KIRK	I didn't mean this future.
BONES	Are we playing multiple choice?
KIRK	Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
BONES	Specifically of...?
KIRK	No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
BONES	Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
KIRK	Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
BONES	Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -

BONES	What is it with you, anyway?
KIRK	Still think we're finished?
BONES	More than ever.

BONES	What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
KIRK	Don't remind me.

BONES	Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
KIRK	No way.  You see this?

KIRK	It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
BONES	That cunning little Vulcan...
KIRK	Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
BONES	If they're even looking for us...
KIRK	Spock's looking for us...

BONES	ARE YOU CRAZY?
KIRK	She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...

BONES	Damned clever if you ask me...
KIRK	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...

BONES	ABSOLUTELY NOT!
KIRK	Come on...

KIRK	Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
BONES	And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
KIRK	To be -

CHEKOV	Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
BONES	And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.

CHEKOV	We're explorers not diplomats!
BONES	Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...

CHEKOV	Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
BONES	Now there's a poser.

BONES	This is fun...
CHEKOV	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?

BONES	Too bad we can't SMELL her.
CHEKOV	In space, no one can hear you sweat.

BONES	They don't arrest people for having feelings.
CHEKOV	If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?

BONES	Are you carrying a surgeon?
CHANG	We were until your torpedoes!
BONES	Then let me help!

CHANG	Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
BONES	Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.

BONES	For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
CHANG	Stand...?
BONES	Retire.
CHANG	Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?

CHANG	Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
BONES	Barely.
CHANG	Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?

BONES	I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
CHANG	You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?

BONES	I was nervous -
CHANG	You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
BONES	I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
CHANG	The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.

BONES	I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
MARTIA	They'll make it look like an accident...
BONES	What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
MARTIA	I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

MARTIA	They'll respect him now...
BONES	That's a comfort...

MARTIA	It takes a lot of effort.
BONES	I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
MARTIA	I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.

CHANG	I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
KIRK	I'm not sure how to take that.

KIRK	Would you care to go topside?
CHANG	Very much.

CHANG	To be or not to be, that is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
KIRK	I beg your pardon?

KIRK	My God, what happened here?
CHANG	You feign ignorance?
KIRK	WHAT HAPPENED?
CHANG	You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!

KIRK	He's a DOCTOR!
CHANG	How can I trust --

CHANG	Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
KIRK	He just tried to save him!
CHANG	Take them away.

KIRK	What?
CHANG	Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
KIRK	The drink WAS served...

CHANG	And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
KIRK	There... were no other ships in the sector.
CHANG	Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
KIRK	I checked the data banks, yes.
CHANG	And what did they tell you?
KIRK	That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -

CHANG	And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
KIRK	That isn't true...!
CHANG	That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.

CHANG	Are those your words?
KIRK	Yes.
CHANG	Spoken by you?
KIRK	Yes...
CHANG	Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
KIRK	Those words WERE spoken by me.

CHANG	You were demoted...
KIRK	Yes.
CHANG	For insubordination.
KIRK	I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
CHANG	And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?

CHANG	You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
KIRK	Well, I -
CHANG	You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
KIRK	I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
CHANG	Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
KIRK	I am.
CHANG	So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?

KIRK	As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
CHANG	Your honors, the State rests.

CHEKOV	Where is Mr. Sulu?
KIRK	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?

CHEKOV	Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
KIRK	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...

CHEKOV	Just the size of my head -
KIRK	I know what you mean...

CHEKOV	Torpedo room--?
KIRK	Uhura, monitor!

CHEKOV	Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
KIRK	Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?

CHEKOV	Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
KIRK	First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.

CHEKOV	From Starfleet?
KIRK	Who else?

CHEKOV	Where IS the conference?
KIRK	She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.

KIRK	She's here - somewhere.
CHEKOV	But if she's cloaked...
KIRK	Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...

KIRK	Shields. Battle stations.
CHEKOV	Shields up. Battle stations.

KIRK	Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...

KIRK	Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
CHEKOV	Aye, sir; thrusters...

CHEKOV	Course heading, Captain?
KIRK	Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...

SPOCK	They're preparing to fire.
CHEKOV	Shields up, Captain --?

SPOCK	You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
CHEKOV	What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
SPOCK	You tell them, Lieutenant.

SPOCK	Klingon blood.
CHEKOV	They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
SPOCK	This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
CHEKOV	Now we go to Starfleet?
SPOCK	Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
CHEKOV	ALL uniforms?

CHEKOV	Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
SPOCK	Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.

SPOCK	You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
CHEKOV	She programmed the torpedo hits?

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Aye, sir.
SULU	Mr. Valtane, any more data?

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
SULU	Onscreen.

SULU	An INCIDENT?
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Do we report this, sir?
SULU	Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...

SULU	Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.

GORKON	This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
KIRK	Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
GORKON	Thank you, Captain.
KIRK	Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?

GORKON	We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
KIRK	We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
GORKON	I shall look forward to it.

KIRK	Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
GORKON	Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..

GORKON	Your research laboratory is most impressive...
KIRK	Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
GORKON	This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...

GORKON	Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
KIRK	We must do this again soon.

KIRK	I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
MARTIA'S VOICE	Give a girl a chance, Captain.

KIRK	An accident wasn't good enough...
MARTIA'S VOICE	Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.

KIRK	Your friends are late...
MARTIA'S VOICE	They'll be here...

KIRK	Isn't it about time you became something else?
MARTIA'S VOICE	I like it here...

KIRK	What took you so long?
MARTIA'S VOICE	Kill him! He's the one!!
KIRK	Not me, idiot - HIM!

MARTIA	He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
KIRK	He's got it.
MARTIA	And your coat.
KIRK	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
MARTIA	Krandog aranty.

KIRK	How did you know...?
MARTIA	There's a reward for your death.

MARTIA	We don't get many presidential assassins.
KIRK	We didn't kill Gorkon.
MARTIA	Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.

KIRK	How much time's left of your sentence?
MARTIA	Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.

MARTIA	That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
KIRK	Anything else you want to tell me?

MARTIA	When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
KIRK	There's gotta be a way out of this place...

MARTIA	Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
KIRK	Except us.
MARTIA	It IS possible.

MARTIA	I know how to get outside the shield.
KIRK	Where do we come in?
MARTIA	Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
KIRK	Possibly.
MARTIA	I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
KIRK	Candidate for what?

SCOTTY	Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
KIRK	Energize...

KIRK	Stand down your weapons.
SCOTTY	Captain, if --
KIRK	Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
SCOTTY	Aye, sir.

SCOTTY	This is incredible -
KIRK	WHO ELSE...?

KIRK	As you were. Lieutenant...?
LT. SAAVIK	Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.

LT. SAAVIK	Aft thrusters -
KIRK	Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
LT. SAAVIK	Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?

LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
KIRK	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK	Kronos, sir?
KIRK	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK	Aye, sir.

LT. SAAVIK	Sorry -
KIRK	Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
LT. SAAVIK	We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
KIRK	Right -

LT. SAAVIK	I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
KIRK	You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
LT. SAAVIK	I always wanted to try that.
KIRK	Only don't try putting words in my mouth.

KIRK	Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
LT. SAAVIK	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...

KIRK	I hope you're happy.
LT. SAAVIK	Captain.

KIRK	Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
LT. SAAVIK	Sir?
KIRK	Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?

LT. SAAVIK	Captain, our shields -- !
KIRK	Uhura, signal our surrender.

KIRK	Who is "US?"
LT. SAAVIK	I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
KIRK	Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.

LT. SAAVIK	Just the prototype.
KIRK	You hear that?

SULU	This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
KIRK	Sulu!
SULU	Standing by, Captain Kirk.
KIRK	You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
SULU	I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
KIRK	Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
SULU	The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
KIRK	I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
SULU	Surely not.
KIRK	I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...

SULU	I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
KIRK	When does this conference start?
SULU	According to my information, today.
KIRK	Thank you, Captain Sulu.
SULU	Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

KIRK	Me?
SPOCK	We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.

SPOCK	I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
KIRK	You have personally -

KIRK	WE volunteered?
SPOCK	There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
KIRK	How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
SPOCK	I was asked by my father to open neg-
KIRK	I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
SPOCK	Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
KIRK	DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
SPOCK	They're dying.
KIRK	LET THEM DIE.

SPOCK	Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
KIRK	Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...

KIRK	Never been this close.
SPOCK	The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.

SPOCK	I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
KIRK	Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -

SPOCK	I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
KIRK	I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.

KIRK	What is it?
SPOCK	I am uncertain.
KIRK	Spock, I'm really tired...
SPOCK	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
KIRK	Where?
SPOCK	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
KIRK	From Enterprise?

KIRK	What the -
SPOCK	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -

KIRK	We HAVEN'T fired -
SPOCK	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...

SPOCK	I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
KIRK	I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
SPOCK	Perhaps you're right.

SPOCK	Captain...
KIRK	He was just about to explain the whole damn -

SPOCK	The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
KIRK	So, that's it..

SPOCK	The peace conference.
KIRK	What peace conference?
SPOCK	Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...

SPOCK	I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
KIRK	Why would they give them to us?
SPOCK	The Commander is an old friend of yours.

KIRK	Are you dining on worms?
SPOCK	You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
KIRK	The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.

KIRK	I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
SPOCK	I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
KIRK	You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
SPOCK	I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
KIRK	Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...

SPOCK	Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
KIRK	Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
SPOCK	I SHOULD have been -
KIRK	Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
SPOCK	But I am not human. I am only -
KIRK	Spock, you want to know something?

KIRK	Close enough to beam down?
SPOCK	Not yet... Section 4236...

SPOCK	Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
KIRK	Make ourselves a target?

KIRK	What's she waiting for?
SPOCK	Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.

KIRK	But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
SPOCK	I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
KIRK	Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.

KIRK	The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
SPOCK	... is to trust him.

UHURA	Control tower, reading, Sir.
KIRK	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.

UHURA	Channel open, Captain.
KIRK	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.

UHURA	Captain --
KIRK	WE SURRENDER.
UHURA	This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --

UHURA	It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
KIRK	I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.

UHURA	Gorkon's own man??
KIRK	Who else?

KIRK	Uhura?
UHURA	Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.

UHURA	Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
KIRK	Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.

SPOCK	You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
LT. SAAVIK	Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
SPOCK	I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.

SPOCK	You must have faith.
LT. SAAVIK	Faith...?
SPOCK	That the universe will unfold as it should.

LT. SAAVIK	But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
SPOCK	What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.

LT. SAAVIK	How did you - ?
SPOCK	In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.

SPOCK	Her own father...?
LT. SAAVIK	Such things have happened before, sir.

SPOCK	Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK	Not as yet, sir.
SPOCK	Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
LT. SAAVIK	Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
SPOCK	Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
SPOCK	An omission. After that -

SPOCK	Any progress?
LT. SAAVIK	We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
SPOCK	Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.

LT. SAAVIK	Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
SPOCK	I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.

LT. SAAVIK	A lie?
SPOCK	An error.

SPOCK	If you are logical.
LT. SAAVIK	I don't want to.
SPOCK	I believe you. Please...

SPOCK	But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
LT. SAAVIK	You can't prove any of this...

SPOCK	Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
LT. SAAVIK	You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.

LT. SAAVIK	Direct hit -
UHURA	Confirmed, Captain!

LT. SAAVIK	Trouble?
UHURA	We've been ordered to -
LT. SAAVIK	In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
UHURA	We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.

UHURA	We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
LT. SAAVIK	I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.

OFFICER	Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
SULU	What?
OFFICER	Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
SULU	Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
OFFICER	Sir?
SULU	You having hearing problems, mister?
OFFICER	No, sir.

SULU	According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
SCIENCE OFFICER	Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
SULU	Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...

SCIENCE OFFICER	I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
SULU	Visual!

SULU	Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
SULU	Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"

SCIENCE OFFICER	I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
SULU	What is it?
SCIENCE OFFICER	... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

SULU	Praxis?
SCIENCE OFFICER	What's left of it.

SCOTTY	At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
SPOCK	I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.

SCOTTY	NO WAY!
SPOCK	Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.

SCOTTY	It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
SPOCK	Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
SCOTTY	A computer canna lie, sir.
SPOCK	I think  not.
SCOTTY	You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
SPOCK	We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY	That could take hours!
SPOCK	Nevertheless.
SCOTTY	And if they're still in place?
SPOCK	Then someone forged a data bank entry.

SCOTTY	They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
SPOCK	That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.

SCOTTY	Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
SPOCK	I know precisely where he'll be.

SCOTTY	They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
SPOCK	There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
SCOTTY	Not from us!

SPOCK	Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
SCOTTY	If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
SPOCK	Would they?

SCOTTY	A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
SPOCK	This one can.
SCOTTY	They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
SPOCK	I believe I am.

SCOTTY	- could take weeks, sir.
SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.

SPOCK	They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
SCOTTY	Aye, aye, sir.

SPOCK	They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
UHURA	How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?

SPOCK	I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
UHURA	Yes, sir.

UHURA	Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
SPOCK	He's placing himself in a most awkward position...

SPOCK	An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
UHURA	What exactly does that mean?
SPOCK	It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.

SPOCK	And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
UHURA	Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
SPOCK	I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...

UHURA	I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
SPOCK	Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?

UHURA	You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
SPOCK	At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

SPOCK	I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
UHURA	Maybe we should write them a letter?

SPOCK	Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
UHURA	Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

UHURA	They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
SPOCK	But you didn't join a conspiracy.

DATA	Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
B-9	I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...

B-9	Fuzzy face is gone.
DATA	Yes, please continue.
B-9	I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat


DATA	Do you know who I am?
B-9	You are me.
DATA	No. My name is Data... I am your brother.

DATA	Do you know where you are?
B-9	I am in a room with lights.

DATA	Can you remember our father?
B-9	No.

DATA	Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
B-9	No.
DATA	Is that your final answer?

B-9	Brother. I cannot move.
DATA	No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
B-9	Why?
DATA	Because you are dangerous.
B-9	Why?
DATA	You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
B-9	I do not understand.
DATA	I know.

DATA	Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
B-9	No.
DATA	Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
B-9	No. Can I move now?
DATA	No. I must deactivate you.
B-9	For how long?
DATA	Indefinitely.
B-9	How long is that?

PICARD	I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
BEVERLY	It'll serve you right.

BEVERLY	Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
PICARD	Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
BEVERLY	If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.

PICARD	When was he... created?
BEVERLY	About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
PICARD	I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.

BEVERLY	It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
PICARD	Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.

PICARD	Beverly, come in.
BEVERLY	You're working late.

PICARD	Remember him?
BEVERLY	He was a bit proud as I recall.
PICARD	He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
BEVERLY	He turned out all right.

PICARD	I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
BEVERLY	Is he very much like you were?
PICARD	Yes.

BEVERLY	Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
PICARD	I wish I could believe that, Doctor.

BEVERLY	Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
PICARD	Can you describe it, Deanna?

BEVERLY	The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
PICARD	But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
BEVERLY	As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
PICARD	Dying?

PICARD	How long does he have?
BEVERLY	I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

BEVERLY	But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
PICARD	I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.

PICARD	To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
BEVERLY	That was another time.
PICARD	How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.

BEVERLY	You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
PICARD	Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
BEVERLY	They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
PICARD	Not tonight, I have work here.
BEVERLY	Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.

PICARD	So... To happy endings.
DATA	To happy endings.

DATA	Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
PICARD	I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
DATA	And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
PICARD	Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
DATA	And this makes you "sad"?
PICARD	Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
DATA	That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
PICARD	Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...

DATA	The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
PICARD	You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.

DATA	If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
PICARD	Now, you make a toast.
DATA	To new worlds...
PICARD	New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...

DATA	The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
PICARD	Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.

DATA	The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
PICARD	Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

DATA	He is very observant.
PICARD	I can see that.

PICARD	Data!
DATA	Sorry, sir.

DATA	Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
PICARD	Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.

DATA	Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
PICARD	On my way.

DATA	My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
PICARD	Good work. The download?
DATA	He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.

PICARD	A bit less florid, Data.
DATA	Aye, sir... This way.

PICARD	A weapon.
DATA	It would appear so.

DATA	Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
PICARD	It'll only work for one of us.
DATA	Yes, sir.
PICARD	We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
DATA	There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.

PICARD	Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
DATA	They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
PICARD	While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!

PICARD	What do you imagine this is?
DATA	Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?

PICARD	Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
DATA	Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
PICARD	Well then... only one way to go.

DATA	Do you think this is a wise course of action?
PICARD	We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
DATA	Ready, Captain.
PICARD	Fire!

PICARD	How long until we reach the fleet?
DATA	At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.

PICARD	For now we see but through a glass darkly... He said he's a mirror.
DATA	Of you?
PICARD	Yes.
DATA	I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
PICARD	But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
DATA	He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
PICARD	He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
DATA	No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
PICARD	How can you be sure?
DATA	I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

DATA	We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
PICARD	It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
DATA	Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
PICARD	Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

DATA	We are losing dorsal shields.
PICARD	Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!

DATA	Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
PICARD	Divert power and compensate.

DATA	We are being hailed.
PICARD	Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.

DATA	Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
PICARD	Negative.
DATA	Sir.

HEAD	Why am I looking at me?
DATA	You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
HEAD	You do not look like me.

HEAD	You have a red shirt.
DATA	This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
HEAD	Why?
DATA	Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
HEAD	Why?

DATA	Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
GEORDI	How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
DATA	I thought only me, myself and Lore.

DATA	Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
GEORDI	Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .

GEORDI	Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
DATA	Do you have a name, sir?

DATA	At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
GEORDI	I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
DATA	Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
GEORDI	He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
DATA	I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
GEORDI	An individual more like you, you mean.
DATA	Yes.
GEORDI	Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.

DATA	What purpose does this serve?
GEORDI	It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
DATA	Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
GEORDI	It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
DATA	No, I do not mind.

DATA	But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
GEORDI	Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
DATA	I am not.

DATA	We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
GEORDI	Emergency force fields are holding.

DATA	What is our approximate distance?

DATA	It appears to be...  ... an arm.
WORF	Why is it moving?
DATA	Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.

WORF	It's you.
DATA	The resemblance is... striking.

WORF	No.
DATA	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?

WORF	If you wouldn't mind.
DATA	Thank you.

DEANNA	Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
PICARD	The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
DEANNA	And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
PICARD	The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.

PICARD	May I have this dance?
DEANNA	With pleasure, Captain.

PICARD	Counselor.
DEANNA	Do you have a moment, sir?
PICARD	Of course, sit down.

DEANNA	It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
PICARD	You're speaking of emotional investment?
DEANNA	The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
PICARD	As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
DEANNA	I don't believe that, sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.

PICARD	I'm going to miss you.
DEANNA	And I you.

DEANNA	I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
PICARD	Is he sincere about wanting peace?
DEANNA	I don't know.

DEANNA	Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
PICARD	How could I not?
DEANNA	Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
PICARD	I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!

DEANNA	Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
PICARD	Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...

DEANNA	How can you be certain?
PICARD	I know how he thinks.

DEANNA	Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
PICARD	Counselor?
DEANNA	The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
PICARD	Make it so.

DEANNA	But how can he? He'll kill you.
PICARD	This isn't about me anymore.

DEANNA	I'm only half human.
SHINZON	Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.

SHINZON	Imzadi. This is so good.
DEANNA	No!

SHINZON	He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
DEANNA	This isn't real.
SHINZON	Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?

SHINZON	I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
DEANNA	You sick bastard!

DEANNA	You're not here.
SHINZON	Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.

DEANNA	No.
SHINZON	I can feel your desire, Deanna.

DONATRA	Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
PICARD	Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
DONATRA	The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
PICARD	When this is over, I owe you a drink.

DONATRA	I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
PICARD	Do you have life support?
PICARD	Understood.

PICARD	Open a channel.
DONATRA	This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
PICARD	Thank you, Commander.

GEORDI	It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
PICARD	What do we know about the planet?
GEORDI	Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
PICARD	Theories?

GEORDI	I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
PICARD	What do we know about the population?

PICARD	Cannon fodder.
GEORDI	Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

GEORDI	It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
PICARD	What programs were accessed?
GEORDI	That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
PICARD	Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
GEORDI	There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.

PICARD	I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
GEORDI	Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
PICARD	As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.

GEORDI	It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
PICARD	And that's exactly what he's going to do.

GEORDI	He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
PICARD	What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?

GEORDI	What's he doing?
PICARD	He wants to look me in the eye.

PICARD	He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
GEORDI	Sir?
PICARD	Weve got him!

PICARD	Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
GEORDI	Aye, sir.
PICARD	Deanna, on my mark.
GEORDI	Ready, sir!

PICARD	How long until he can fire?
GEORDI	The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

PICARD	Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
GEORDI	Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
PICARD	That's an order, Commander.

PICARD	You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
GEORDI	Aye, sir.

GEORDI	Sir, we're being hailed.
PICARD	On screen.

PICARD	Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
GEORDI	I'll take care of it, sir.
PICARD	Number One.  You have the bridge.

PICARD	Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
PICARD	With or without the rest of the fleet?
JANEWAY	A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
PICARD	New Praetor?
JANEWAY	There's more... as always. He's Reman.

JANEWAY	 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
PICARD	Understood.
PICARD	Not with the Romulans.
PICARD	Just lucky, Admiral.
JANEWAY	Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.

VICEROY	Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
PICARD	Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
VICEROY	I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.

VICEROY	So, human... you've met your better self!
PICARD	What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
VICEROY	I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
PICARD	That will never happen.
VICEROY	Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...

VICEROY	It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
PICARD	There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
VICEROY	I look forward to the sport.  Take him.

WORF	I won't do it.
PICARD	Wont do what, Mister Worf?
WORF	Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
PICARD	Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?

WORF	I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
PICARD	What sort of signature?

WORF	To find the head, sir?
PICARD	If you don't mind.

WORF	Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
PICARD	Not yet, Mister Worf.

PICARD	No!
WORF	Captain!
PICARD	Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
WORF	Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.

WORF	We're being hailed.
PICARD	On screen.

WORF	Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
PICARD	Who was it?

PICARD	Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
WORF	Aye, sir

WORF	Sir, we're being hailed.
PICARD	On screen.

PICARD	Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
WORF	Aye, sir.

WORF	Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
PICARD	On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.

PICARD	What's this?
WORF	Your new chair, sir.

RIKER	Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
PICARD	Still well on our side...

PICARD	I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
RIKER	Thank you, sir...
PICARD	Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if youll excuse me.  Ill be in the gym.

RIKER	Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
PICARD	I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
RIKER	Sir --
PICARD	Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.

RIKER	Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
PICARD	Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.

RIKER	We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
PICARD	A coup d'etat?
RIKER	The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.

RIKER	Why don't they answer our hails?
PICARD	It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
RIKER	It's working.
PICARD	Counselor?

RIKER	Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
PICARD	Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.

RIKER	She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
PICARD	She's a predator.

RIKER	Not very chatty.
PICARD	Away team. Transporter room four.

RIKER	He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
PICARD	Can anything be done for him?

RIKER	Sir?
PICARD	His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
RIKER	Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
PICARD	And the Romulans invade.

RIKER	Strength in numbers?
PICARD	We can only hope so.

PICARD	Report.
RIKER	He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.

PICARD	Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
RIKER	Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
PICARD	Agreed.

PICARD	The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
RIKER	She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.

RIKER	But she's not the Enterprise.
PICARD	I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
RIKER	Anything.
PICARD	When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
RIKER	I intend to.

RIKER	Serving with you has been an honor.
PICARD	The honor was mine. Captain Riker.

SHINZON	I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
PICARD	Praetor Shinzon?

PICARD	And you're not as we imagined you.
SHINZON	No?

PICARD	Praetor?
SHINZON	I've never met a human woman.

SHINZON	I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
PICARD	Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.

SHINZON	On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
PICARD	Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
SHINZON	Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
PICARD	I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
SHINZON	Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.

SHINZON	I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
PICARD	And the Senate supports you?
SHINZON	I have dissolved the Senate.

SHINZON	Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
PICARD	Yes.
SHINZON	And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.

SHINZON	But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
PICARD	Yes.
SHINZON	Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.

SHINZON	No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
PICARD	You know I do.

PICARD	We need to talk, just you and I.
SHINZON	Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
PICARD	You know I need to verify this.
SHINZON	I know.

SHINZON	And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
PICARD	What happened?
SHINZON	As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.

SHINZON	Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
PICARD	You'll acquire a taste for it.

SHINZON	It's not quite the face you remember.
PICARD	Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
SHINZON	A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
PICARD	Yes. The eyes have it.
SHINZON	Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
PICARD	How did you end up on Remus?
SHINZON	They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.

SHINZON	For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
PICARD	You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
SHINZON	No race should be a slave to another.

SHINZON	You don't trust me.
PICARD	I have no reason to.
SHINZON	Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
PICARD	And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
SHINZON	All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.

SHINZON	I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
PICARD	There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
SHINZON	Were we always explorers?
PICARD	No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
SHINZON	Looking up at the stars.
PICARD	Yes.
SHINZON	And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
PICARD	New worlds.

PICARD	After you, Praetor.
SHINZON	Age before rank, Jean Luc.

PICARD	So I'm not as tall as you expected?
SHINZON	I always hoped I would hit two meters.
PICARD	With a full head of hair.
SHINZON	There is that.

PICARD	Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
SHINZON	I know.
PICARD	If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
SHINZON	I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.

SHINZON	In time, Jean Luc.
PICARD	In time.

SHINZON	Hello, Jean Luc.
PICARD	Why am I here?
SHINZON	I was lonely...

PICARD	What are you doing?
SHINZON	I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 

PICARD	All of this so you could capture me?
SHINZON	Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.

SHINZON	Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
PICARD	What's this all about?
SHINZON	It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
PICARD	You're not Reman.
SHINZON	And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
PICARD	I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
SHINZON	I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
PICARD	I won't defend my life to you.
SHINZON	My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
PICARD	If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
SHINZON	Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
PICARD	Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
SHINZON	It amazes me how little you know yourself.
PICARD	I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
SHINZON	I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.

SHINZON	You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
PICARD	We are.
SHINZON	It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
PICARD	Why are you here?
SHINZON	To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
PICARD	And what of the Enterprise?
SHINZON	I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
PICARD	You know that's not possible.
SHINZON	I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
PICARD	Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.

PICARD	I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
SHINZON	Long ago.
PICARD	Not so long.
SHINZON	Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
PICARD	I see more than what you are.

PICARD	The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
SHINZON	He is what his life has made him!

SHINZON	Yes.
PICARD	So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
SHINZON	I don't know.
PICARD	But you want to.

SHINZON	That's your life... not mine.
PICARD	Please.
SHINZON	Its too late.
PICARD	You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
SHINZON	I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!

SHINZON	I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
PICARD	I am.
SHINZON	Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?

REMAN OFFICER	Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
SHINZON	On my way.

SHINZON	Report!
REMAN OFFICER	Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!

SHINZON	Target disruptors. Destroy them.
REMAN OFFICER	Disruptors are off-line, sir.

SHINZON	Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
REMAN OFFICER	What about Picard?
SHINZON	Our greater goal is more important, brother.
REMAN OFFICER	But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...

RIKER	Well, that sounds relaxing too.
WORF	It is... invigorating.

RIKER	So theyve got him up and running.
WORF	He's a very unusual android.
RIKER	Runs in the family.

RIKER	My God...
WORF	Should I raise shields?

WORF	Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
RIKER	Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.

RIKER	Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
WORF	We're being hailed.

WORF	Intruder alert!
RIKER	Let's go.

SHINZON	Are we prepared?
VICEROY	Yes, Praetor.

VICEROY	This is a mistake.
SHINZON	He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
VICEROY	Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
SHINZON	My time. I'll spend it how I choose.

VICEROY	The bond is broken.
SHINZON	Find her again.
VICEROY	No -- this is wasting time.
SHINZON	Do as I tell you!

VICEROY	It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
SHINZON	Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'

SHINZON	How long?
VICEROY	A matter of hours now.

SHINZON	How long until we reach the Rift?
VICEROY	Seven minutes.

SHINZON	Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
VICEROY	What?!
SHINZON	You heard me.

VICEROY	Praetor...
SHINZON	FULL STOP AND FIRE !

SHINZON	What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
VICEROY	She is here.

SHINZON	Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
SURAN	They're holding position.
SHINZON	And?
SURAN	They will obey, Praetor.
SHINZON	It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.

SURAN	How many Warbirds will you need?
SHINZON	None.

SURAN	Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
SHINZON	The Scimitar will serve my needs.
SURAN	But surely...
SHINZON	I came this far alone ...

SURAN	Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
SHINZON	You don't have to understand.
SURAN	And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
SHINZON	I have a purpose.
SURAN	Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
SHINZON	Silence, Romulan!

SHINZON	You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
SURAN	Praetor.
SHINZON	Now go. I have some personal business.

SHINZON	The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
SHINZON	I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
SURAN	And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--

SHINZON	Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
SURAN	For the moment.
SHINZON	And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!

BEEMER	Yeah, that's right.
LENNY	I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
BEEMER	Bullshit politics.
LENNY	It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
BEEMER	Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
LENNY	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
BEEMER	I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
LENNY	Just not the eyes.

LENNY	Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
EDUARDO	What's all this squid shit?

LENNY	Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
EDUARDO	Hey, fuck you, man.
LENNY	Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
EDUARDO	Yeah, right.

LENNY	Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
EDUARDO	No problem.
LENNY	A star is born.

FAITH	We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
TRAN	Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.

TRAN	Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
FAITH	Leave him alone, Tran.
TRAN	He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
FAITH	You're too goddamned paranoid.
TRAN	Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.

FAITH	Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
TRAN	A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?

FAITH	I made my choice, Lenny.
TRAN	You're going down.

FAITH	You said you were going to get her out of this.
TRAN	Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
FAITH	He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
TRAN	I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--

TRAN	The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
FAITH	Fuck you.
TRAN	Maybe later.

FAITH	Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
TRAN	Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
FAITH	I live for the moment.

MAX	This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
FAITH	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
MAX	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
FAITH	What're you going to do?

FAITH	You can't just... kill him.
MAX	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
FAITH	Jesus.
MAX	Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.

MAX	Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
FAITH	My God.

MAX	You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
FAITH	I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
MAX	I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
FAITH	Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'

MAX	And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
FAITH	'We might as well make the best of it.'

FAITH	Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
LENNY	Watch and see.

FAITH	I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
LENNY	I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.

FAITH	I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
LENNY	Forget it's there.
FAITH	Make me forget it, baby.

FAITH	Cut it out, Tran.
LENNY	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.

FAITH	I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
LENNY	I just got to talk to you for one second.

LENNY	Faith, call me, okay?
FAITH	No, Lenny.

LENNY	Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
FAITH	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
LENNY	I'm already hurting.

FAITH	You have to go.  I mean it.
LENNY	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
FAITH	You talked to Iris?  When?
LENNY	Tonight.
FAITH	Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
LENNY	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
FAITH	Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
LENNY	It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
FAITH	That's a good one, coming from you.
LENNY	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
FAITH	He has his uses too.
LENNY	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
FAITH	Maybe.
LENNY	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.

LENNY	Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
FAITH	Damn right.
LENNY	It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.

FAITH	You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
LENNY	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
FAITH	Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
LENNY	Can't do it.
FAITH	You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.

FAITH	You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
LENNY	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

FAITH	Who did it?
LENNY	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
FAITH	Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
LENNY	I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
FAITH	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
LENNY	Tell me.

FAITH	What's going on?
LENNY	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
FAITH	Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.

LENNY	How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
FAITH	We should talk alone.
LENNY	No.  Mace is in this.

FAITH	So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
LENNY	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
FAITH	You think Tran killed her?
LENNY	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
FAITH	What a nightmare.

KEITH	I understand.  No, I'm not.
LENNY	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
KEITH	That's right.

KEITH	No.
LENNY	A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
KEITH	Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
LENNY	I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
KEITH	Clips.
LENNY	That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
KEITH	What kind of things exactly?
LENNY	Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.

KEITH	Sounds good.
LENNY	I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
KEITH	Talk to me about costs, here.
LENNY	Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
KEITH	What?  Right Here?
LENNY	Step into my office.

KEITH	Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
LENNY	You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--

MAX	You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
LENNY	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
MAX	Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
LENNY	Least you can do.

MAX	Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
LENNY	Thanks, Max.
MAX	D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
LENNY	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
MAX	That's not sayin' much.
LENNY	It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.

LENNY	You were lucky, Max.
MAX	Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!

LENNY	Naw.  She won't call me.
MAX	Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
LENNY	Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.

MAX	I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
LENNY	Hey, Iris, you okay?

MAX	See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
LENNY	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
MAX	An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

MAX	I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
LENNY	Shutup a second!

LENNY	Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
MAX	I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
LENNY	You should feel like shit.
MAX	I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
LENNY	Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
MAX	I'm on her.

MAX	You alright?  Y'okay?
LENNY	Yeah.  No, not really.
MAX	Let's work it.
LENNY	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
MAX	Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
LENNY	He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
MAX	And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
LENNY	He records himself raping and killing her--
MAX	But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
LENNY	So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
MAX	So've I.  Too much.
LENNY	But this is a bad one.
MAX	Top ten.
LENNY	He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.

MAX	That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
LENNY	Why me?

MAX	Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
LENNY	W'sup, Max?

LENNY	Faith OK?
MAX	Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
LENNY	Looks like she was holding out.
MAX	Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
LENNY	He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
MAX	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.

MAX	Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
LENNY	You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

LENNY	He's been cooked-off
MAX	Is he dead?
LENNY	No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.

LENNY	Whattya mean?
MAX	All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
LENNY	What stuff?
MAX	Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.

LENNY	Jesus.
MAX	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
LENNY	Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!

MAX	Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
LENNY	Okay... what about Strickland?
MAX	No.  Bad idea.

MAX	He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
LENNY	What do you mean?
MAX	Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
LENNY	This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
MAX	Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?

LENNY	2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
MAX	I intend to.

LENNY	No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
MAX	Only way I could stand your ties.

MAX	I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
LENNY	Where's Faith?
MAX	I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
LENNY	What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?

MAX	You just did.
LENNY	Jesus!
MAX	You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.

LENNY	So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
MAX	That's pretty much the way it happened.

LENNY	Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
MAX	That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
LENNY	Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
MAX	You bet.  Did you like it?

MAX	Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
LENNY	I won't say anything.
MAX	I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.

MAX	Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
LENNY	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
MAX	No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
LENNY	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
MAX	You got froggy on me a couple times.

LENNY	So there never was a death squad.
MAX	Naawww.
LENNY	Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
MAX	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.

LENNY	How did you hook up with Faith?
MAX	This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...

TICK	Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
LENNY	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
TICK	Sorry.

LENNY	How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
TICK	With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
LENNY	Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
TICK	I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
LENNY	Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
TICK	Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
LENNY	I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
TICK	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
LENNY	So lay it off to somebody else.
TICK	Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...

TICK	Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
LENNY	Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
TICK	Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.

LENNY	Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
TICK	Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
LENNY	I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
TICK	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
LENNY	What else you got?

TICK	Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
LENNY	Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
TICK	Well... the guy's fucked up.

TICK	Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
LENNY	What?
TICK	Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
LENNY	Who was just here?
TICK	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
LENNY	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
TICK	Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
LENNY	What clip?  What was it?
TICK	I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
LENNY	She never gave me a tape.

TRAN	You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
LENNY	You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
TRAN	I already got everything I need from you.

TRAN	Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
LENNY	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
TRAN	I always do.
LENNY	Faith, can I talk to you a second?

TRAN	About what?
LENNY	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?

LENNY	Charm.
TRAN	Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?

LENNY	It's alright.  He means it.
TRAN	I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?

STRICKLAND	Nero.
LENNY	Strickland.
STRICKLAND	Commissioner Strickland.
LENNY	Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
STRICKLAND	Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
LENNY	I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.

STRICKLAND	I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
LENNY	Your sex life?
STRICKLAND	Your existence.

MACE	Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
LENNY	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?

LENNY	Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
MACE	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
LENNY	Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
MACE	Sleaze to peddle.
LENNY	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
MACE	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
LENNY	Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
MACE	Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.

MACE	Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
LENNY	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
MACE	Driving Mr. Lenny.

MACE	So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
LENNY	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
MACE	Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
LENNY	Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
MACE	Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
LENNY	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
MACE	Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
LENNY	Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
MACE	Lenny, this shit's illegal.
LENNY	Define illegal.
MACE	Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
LENNY	Yeah, but that was for love.
MACE	Define love.

LENNY	What's his name?
MACE	Fumitsu.
LENNY	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.

MACE	What the fuck are you doing?
LENNY	Coming with you.
MACE	You will not live to see the morning.

MACE	Are we having a bad night?
LENNY	Let's talk in the car.

LENNY	Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
MACE	I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
LENNY	In LA?  Are you crazy?

LENNY	I need my case.  It's still in the back.
MACE	Get it.

LENNY	That would be no.
MACE	I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
LENNY	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?

LENNY	I thought we were friends.
MACE	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
LENNY	So am I.  Just trying to get by.
MACE	No, you're just trying to get off.
LENNY	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
MACE	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
LENNY	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
MACE	Look, I gotta get some sleep.
LENNY	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?

MACE	Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
LENNY	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
MACE	Jesus, Lenny.
LENNY	Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
MACE	Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.

LENNY	Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
MACE	Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
LENNY	Rams... that's football, right?

MACE	Forget her.
LENNY	She still loves me.
MACE	She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
LENNY	She's my destiny.
MACE	Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
LENNY	You'll see.

MACE	You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
LENNY	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
MACE	What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
LENNY	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

MACE	What's that?  Present from Faith?
LENNY	No idea.

MACE	What is it?
LENNY	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!

MACE	My God, Lenny.  What is it?
LENNY	Black.  Jack.
MACE	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
LENNY	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
MACE	Are you sure it's real?

MACE	And gives it to you.
LENNY	Wants to share.

MACE	Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
LENNY	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.

LENNY	Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
MACE	This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.

LENNY	Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
MACE	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--

LENNY	Is this great fabric or what?
MACE	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
LENNY	Never really thought about it.

LENNY	He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
MACE	So that gives you something.
LENNY	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.

MACE	Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
LENNY	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...

MACE	No more, Lenny.
LENNY	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

LENNY	She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
MACE	It's not your fault.

LENNY	See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
MACE	But that doesn't add, does it.
LENNY	No it doesn't.
MACE	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.

LENNY	She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
MACE	So the guy's not a sicko.
LENNY	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
MACE	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
LENNY	Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
MACE	That's where it gets a little strange.
LENNY	And what about the guy that was following me?
MACE	Now you're really getting paranoid.

LENNY	The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
MACE	Sure.

LENNY	How's Zander?
MACE	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.

MACE	I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
LENNY	S'okay.  I know you still love me.

MACE	Whatup Lenny?
LENNY	Jesus, Mace!

MACE	Where we going?
LENNY	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.

MACE	What is it?
LENNY	This tie doesn't go with blue!

MACE	Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
LENNY	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
MACE	You better keep a low profile for a while.
LENNY	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

MACE	Lenny, have you lost it completely?
LENNY	Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.

MACE	Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
LENNY	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
MACE	Something in your car...

MACE	Lenny, give them the tape.
LENNY	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...

LENNY	Shit!
MACE	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
LENNY	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
MACE	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.

LENNY	Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
MACE	It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.

MACE	This is bad.
LENNY	The gas tank's going to go any second!

LENNY	Are you out of your fucking mind?!
MACE	Fire's out, isn't it?

MACE	I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
LENNY	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.

LENNY	Those two guys were cops.
MACE	You sure?
LENNY	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.

MACE	Tell me.
LENNY	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
MACE	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
LENNY	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.

LENNY	Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
MACE	I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
LENNY	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?

LENNY	We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
MACE	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
LENNY	I've got a good idea, yeah.
MACE	People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
LENNY	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.

LENNY	So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
MACE	Well, look at the plus side.
LENNY	There's a plus side?
MACE	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
LENNY	It was a tough call.
MACE	I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
LENNY	I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
MACE	Why?
LENNY	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.

LENNY	He's totally cut off from the outer world.
MACE	How long does it last?  Oh.

MACE	The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
LENNY	Yeah, right, blow it open.

MACE	Who's Strickland?
LENNY	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.

LENNY	Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
MACE	Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.

LENNY	Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
MACE	I'm not going.
LENNY	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
MACE	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.

MACE	Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
LENNY	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
MACE	I guess.
LENNY	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
MACE	No.  It didn't.

LENNY	I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
MACE	You never told me.
LENNY	But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
MACE	No, it's not.

LENNY	Mace... you're a girl.
MACE	Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.

LENNY	Got your ticket?
MACE	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.

LENNY	You see Tran?
MACE	Uh unh.

LENNY	Alright.  We're going up.
MACE	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
LENNY	I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...

MACE	That's the original.  There are no copies.
LENNY	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.

LENNY	Take it to him.
MACE	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
LENNY	No.  Trust me.

MACE	Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
LENNY	Then we'll be right where we are now.
MACE	Yeah, right.  Fucked.

MACE	Are we under arrest?
LENNY	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

MACE	Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
LENNY	Yeah.  We did.

MACE	Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
LENNY	See you downtown.
MACE	Yeah.  See you there.

ZANDER	Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
MACE	Just Lenny.
ZANDER	Right.  That explains it.
MACE	Are you going to make me beg?

MACE	What is that?
ZANDER	Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
MACE	Well give me some then... I'm starving.

MACE	We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
ZANDER	Aw, Mom!

MACE	No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
MAX	Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

MACE	Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
MAX	Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
MACE	But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
MAX	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.

MAX	He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
MACE	Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?

MAX	Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
MACE	Take the tape to the cops.

MAX	Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
MACE	This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
MAX	There's more to this whole thing than you think.

MACE	So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
MAX	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
MACE	Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
MAX	You really want that on your head?

GOODSPEED	Had a close one.
CARLA	You want to talk about it?

GOODSPEED	Not really.
CARLA	You know how I feel about what you do.

GOODSPEED	Could we change the subject?
CARLA	That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
GOODSPEED	Hey!  Now there's some good news.
CARLA	You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
GOODSPEED	Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.

GOODSPEED	Stick with Carla.
CARLA	Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.

CARLA	Don't stop...  do no stop.
GOODSPEED	Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.

GOODSPEED	Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...

GOODSPEED	Thank you.
SANCHEZ	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED	I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work."

SANCHEZ	Spit it out.

SANCHEZ	What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!

GOODSPEED	Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
SANCHEZ	Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.

GOODSPEED	I'm a field agent.
MASON	Tell me what you really do.

GOODSPEED	I don't understand....
MASON	During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
GOODSPEED	Well yes I suppose ...
MASON	You suppose?
GOODSPEED	Yes.  You'll be outside.

MASON	John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
GOODSPEED	Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.

GOODSPEED	Motor oil?
MASON	For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.

GOODSPEED	Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
MASON	For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
GOODSPEED	Wait.  Where're you going?

GOODSPEED	I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
MASON	No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?

MASON	Limp dick?
GOODSPEED	It's all I could think of.

MASON	Wrong.
GOODSPEED	What, vou?
MASON	I'm not the chemical weapons expert.

GOODSPEED	Mason.  Mason?
MASON	It's about time.

MASON	You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
GOODSPEED	The cell, Mason.

MASON	Surprise, surprise.
GOODSPEED	I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
MASON	An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.

GOODSPEED	Partners?
MASON	Partners.

GOODSPEED	Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
MASON	Womack ripped it up, right?
GOODSPEED	You knew?  All this time?
MASON	I'm not a fool, Billy.
GOODSPEED	All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.

GOODSPEED	God's speed.
MASON	Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.

MASON	St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
GOODSPEED	What's that?  Mason?

CHARLIE	I'll bet!
MAVERICK	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.

CHARLIE	Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
MAVERICK	It's not that.

CHARLIE	It isn't?
MAVERICK	Well, it is. It is that, too.
CHARLIE	That's a big comfort to me.
MAVERICK	I could be, too.
CHARLIE	How so?
MAVERICK	Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
CHARLIE	And on to a bigger one with you?

MAVERICK	Yeah, most likely.
CHARLIE	Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
MAVERICK	I heard of one once.

MAVERICK	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
CHARLIE	I'm with someone.

MAVERICK	I thought he'd never leave.
CHARLIE	Yeow!

MAVERICK	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
CHARLIE	What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
MAVERICK	It would have been really embarrassing!
CHARLIE	How did you know this was my car?
MAVERICK	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
CHARLIE	That's all!
MAVERICK	And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.

CHARLIE	I beg your pardon.
MAVERICK	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
CHARLIE	Why not?
MAVERICK	I saw one.
CHARLIE	You saw a MiG 21?
MAVERICK	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
CHARLIE	Where did you see that?
MAVERICK	It's classified.

CHARLIE	It's what?
MAVERICK	It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

CHARLIE	Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
MAVERICK	Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
MAVERICK	Yes, ma'am.
CHARLIE	Where were you?
MAVERICK	On his six.

CHARLIE	He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
MAVERICK	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.

CHARLIE	If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
MAVERICK	I was inverted.

MAVERICK	Two.
CHARLIE	Two miles.
MAVERICK	Two meters.

CHARLIE	The what?
MAVERICK	You know. The finger.

CHARLIE	It never came up.
MAVERICK	You let me make a fool of myself.
CHARLIE	You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
CHARLIE	No.
MAVERICK	What would?
CHARLIE	You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.

MAVERICK	What would you say, too fast...too quick...
CHARLIE	And far too aggressive.
MAVERICK	It is combat. Every second counts.

MAVERICK	Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
CHARLIE	For what?
MAVERICK	That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
CHARLIE	Apology acknowledged.
MAVERICK	Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
MAVERICK	Um. You.
CHARLIE	There you go with those moves again.
MAVERICK	Too aggressive?
CHARLIE	I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
MAVERICK	I'm special.
CHARLIE	Yes. I'll give you that!
MAVERICK	Give me a break, I'm asking you out.

CHARLIE	I can't.
MAVERICK	I thought there was something... That night in the club...
CHARLIE	Lieutenant...
MAVERICK	Evan... or Maverick.
CHARLIE	Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
MAVERICK	The what?
CHARLIE	Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
MAVERICK	What are you talking about?
CHARLIE	You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
MAVERICK	I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
MAVERICK	Harmless!
CHARLIE	Uh hum.
MAVERICK	What if he's not?
CHARLIE	You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

CHARLIE	And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
MAVERICK	Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
CHARLIE	How about what?
MAVERICK	How about anything, anything you want to do.
CHARLIE	Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
MAVERICK	A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
CHARLIE	What about the plane?
MAVERICK	What plane.
CHARLIE	Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
CHARLIE	Used to what?
MAVERICK	I'm different.
CHARLIE	I'm starting to sense that now.

MAVERICK	Let's make it at eight.
CHARLIE	Make what?
MAVERICK	Anything.
CHARLIE	Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.

CHARLIE	Why'd you do that?

MAVERICK	It dies. We live.
CHARLIE	You're an animal.
MAVERICK	That's true. What are you?
CHARLIE	I don't enjoy watching things suffer.

CHARLIE	No!
MAVERICK	It's not suffering anymore.
CHARLIE	You're horrible
MAVERICK	You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
CHARLIE	You don't have to kill it.
MAVERICK	Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
CHARLIE	You ever think about killing another human being?
MAVERICK	About as much as they think about killing me.

CHARLIE	Does it bother you?
MAVERICK	They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.

MAVERICK	You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
CHARLIE	You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
MAVERICK	That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
CHARLIE	Winston Churchill.

CHARLIE	What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
MAVERICK	All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
CHARLIE	What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
CHARLIE	Are you really that brave?
MAVERICK	I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
CHARLIE	It's just as I thought.
MAVERICK	What?

CHARLIE	You're totally insane.
MAVERICK	Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.

MAVERICK	Come on.
CHARLIE	Where?
MAVERICK	You want to go ballistic?
CHARLIE	I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

MAVERICK	I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
CHARLIE	And now?
MAVERICK	And now I want you.
CHARLIE	You always get what you want?
MAVERICK	I don't know yet.

CHARLIE	I want it understood.
MAVERICK	Anything.
CHARLIE	No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
MAVERICK	Why?
CHARLIE	I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.

MAVERICK	Food...and you...my F-14!
CHARLIE	In that order?
MAVERICK	Well no...inverse order.
CHARLIE	I'm still second best.
MAVERICK	You ever fly an F-14? 
CHARLIE	I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.

CHARLIE	Danger?
MAVERICK	. Yeah!
CHARLIE	Doesn't it ever bother you?
MAVERICK	Why, what's gonna happen?

MAVERICK	Lucky charm.
CHARLIE	What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
MAVERICK	Just good luck.
CHARLIE	Where'd you get it.
MAVERICK	Pawn shop. What's to eat?

CHARLIE	...they say you're alright.
MAVERICK	I'm fine.
CHARLIE	This is it, then.
MAVERICK	What?
CHARLIE	The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
MAVERICK	He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
CHARLIE	That's not what I hear.
MAVERICK	I was flying...my responsibility.
CHARLIE	That's what you get flight pay for.
MAVERICK	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
CHARLIE	Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
MAVERICK	Not to me.
CHARLIE	You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.

MAVERICK	Where are we?
CHARLIE	Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
MAVERICK	You don't have to do this.
CHARLIE	Do what, show you a good time?
MAVERICK	I'm not good company. I should be alone.
CHARLIE	I don't think so, but if that's what you want...

MAVERICK	No.
CHARLIE	What do you want?
MAVERICK	I want it back.
CHARLIE	What?
MAVERICK	Yesterday.

CHARLIE	You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
MAVERICK	That's what I want.
CHARLIE	Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.

CHARLIE	You don't believe that.
MAVERICK	Hardly ever.
CHARLIE	Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
MAVERICK	It does.
CHARLIE	Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.

MAVERICK	What do you do when you come here?
CHARLIE	I sit. I think. I play games.
MAVERICK	What kind of games?
CHARLIE	I like to play "reality".

MAVERICK	How do you play reality.
CHARLIE	It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
MAVERICK	Strip reality! How do you play that?
CHARLIE	It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
MAVERICK	You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
CHARLIE	Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...

CHARLIE	Want to play the game?
MAVERICK	How does it go?
CHARLIE	You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
MAVERICK	What truth?
CHARLIE	The big one. The one that's most on your mind.

MAVERICK	Goose is dead.
CHARLIE	True.
MAVERICK	Now?
CHARLIE	Take something off.
MAVERICK	Off me or off you?
CHARLIE	That's up to you.

MAVERICK	What does it mean?
CHARLIE	That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!

CHARLIE	You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
MAVERICK	That's three.
CHARLIE	And that's one!

MAVERICK	One more.
CHARLIE	Your watch.

CHARLIE	Looks like a tie.
MAVERICK	Who's gonna win?
CHARLIE	We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...

CHARLIE	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
MAVERICK	I was, later.
CHARLIE	Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
MAVERICK	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
CHARLIE	I know exactly what you mean.
MAVERICK	How could you?
CHARLIE	I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
MAVERICK	...Something like that.

CHARLIE	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
MAVERICK	Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
CHARLIE	Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
MAVERICK	I hope you find him.
CHARLIE	I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.

CHARLIE	Well?
MAVERICK	Well what?
CHARLIE	You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
MAVERICK	Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
CHARLIE	I live here, remember?
MAVERICK	Right on the flight line?

CHP	Well... What   is   it?
MAVERICK	Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!

MAVERICK	Yes sir. I do, Sir.
CHP	Well?
MAVERICK	Sir. I was going Mach point one five.

CHP	One SIXTH the speed of sound!
MAVERICK	Yes sir.
CHP	Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
MAVERICK	F-14's sir.
CHP	Tomcats?
MAVERICK	Yes sir!

CHP	Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
MAVERICK	No sir! But you have to be ready.

MAVERICK	Yes, Sergeant?
CHP	Remember one thing.
MAVERICK	Sir?
CHP	Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
MAVERICK	Yes sir!

COUGAR	Can't shake him.
MAVERICK	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
COUGAR	Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.

MAVERICK	I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
COUGAR	I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
MAVERICK	ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.

COUGAR	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
MAVERICK	EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.

COUGAR	MAVERICK.
MAVERICK	YEAH, COUGAR?

COUGAR	YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
MAVERICK	NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
COUGAR	I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.

GOOSE	I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
COUGAR	It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
GOOSE	Let's hope you're right!
COUGAR	What is he doing?
GOOSE	He's pissing me off!

GOOSE	That's missile lock!
COUGAR	He better be kidding!
GOOSE	Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!

COUGAR	We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
GOOSE	These guys are getting on my nerves.

GOOSE	Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
COUGAR	You.

COUGAR	Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
GOOSE	Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
COUGAR	This is crazy!
GOOSE	What is?
COUGAR	Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
GOOSE	What?  What is it?
COUGAR	Were upside down!
GOOSE	You're crazy. We're level.
COUGAR	Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
GOOSE	You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
COUGAR	They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
GOOSE	We're not! Trust me! We're okay.

COUGAR	I'm pulling up.
GOOSE	No! Now we're inverted!

GOOSE	We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
COUGAR	It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
GOOSE	TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.

COUGAR	OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
GOOSE	You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.

FUNGUS	WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
MAVERICK	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
FUNGUS	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
MAVERICK	NO. NO GOOD.

FUNGUS	What are you doing?
MAVERICK	Saving them some paperwork.
FUNGUS	Since when did you care about paperwork?

FUNGUS	If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
MAVERICK	Not anymore.
FUNGUS	So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.

FUNGUS	Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
MAVERICK	Okay, okay.
FUNGUS	Don't tell me okay. Do it!

FUNGUS	BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
MAVERICK	BREAKING LEFT!

FUNGUS	THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
MAVERICK	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
FUNGUS	AND HE'S GUNNING.

FUNGUS	Ohhh Mother!
MAVERICK	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.

FUNGUS	Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
MAVERICK	Roger, I've got it.

FUNGUS	Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
MAVERICK	Yawing right.
FUNGUS	I know!
MAVERICK	Rudder's left, stick's forward.
FUNGUS	Swell! Passing ten thousand!

MAVERICK	I've got it -- hold on!
FUNGUS	Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
MAVERICK	I can recover. Hold on!

FUNGUS	5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
MAVERICK	Okay.

MAVERICK	No! Not again!
FUNGUS	What are you talking about, we gotta go!
MAVERICK	I'm not losing it again!

FUNGUS	Gotta go, man.
MAVERICK	280, 290, 300 knots.
FUNGUS	3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
MAVERICK	You go. I'm staying with it.
FUNGUS	I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...

FUNGUS	Is there something I should know?
MAVERICK	Just relax.
FUNGUS	Is it the plane?
MAVERICK	The plane is fine.
FUNGUS	Is it you?
MAVERICK	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!

FUNGUS	You're not supposed to...
MAVERICK	But I have to!
FUNGUS	Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MAVERICK	MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.

FUNGUS	You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
MAVERICK	Well what?
FUNGUS	What do you want?
MAVERICK	What do I want?
FUNGUS	What do you want?
MAVERICK	Any more MiGs?

MAVERICK	Let me do the talking.
FUNGUS	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!

GIRL	Why do you all have such funny names?
WOLFMAN	You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
GIRL	Why do they call you Wolf?

WOLFMAN	Well, I don't know. That depends.
GIRL	On what?
WOLFMAN	Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
GIRL	Like what?
WOLFMAN	Oh...I'll think of something.

GOOSE	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
ICE	What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
GOOSE	Did what?
ICE	Got you here.
GOOSE	We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.

ICE	That's not what I heard.
GOOSE	We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
ICE	Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?

GOOSE	Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
SLIDER	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
GOOSE	The list is long, but distinguished.
SLIDER	So's my Johnson.
GOOSE	This is Maverick.

SLIDER	So I've heard.
GOOSE	Who's your pilot?
SLIDER	Tom Kazansky.
GOOSE	No shit. The Iceman....
SLIDER	Mister to you.

GOOSE	You think you can stay up with us.
SLIDER	I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
GOOSE	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
SLIDER	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.

SLIDER	What was that?
GOOSE	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.

SLIDER	How was it?
GOOSE	Could use a dash more jet fuel.

SLIDER	Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
GOOSE	Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!

GOOSE	Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
MAVERICK	COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.

GOOSE	What are you doing?
MAVERICK	Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?

GOOSE	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
MAVERICK	Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
GOOSE	Gotta keep track of the competition.

MAVERICK	You ever done this before?
GOOSE	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!

GOOSE	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
MAVERICK	Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.

MAVERICK	What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
GOOSE	Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

MAVERICK	I've lost him -- where is he?
GOOSE	On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!

GOOSE	Great move. Great
MAVERICK	He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.

MAVERICK	We did it!
GOOSE	Look, Ma, top of the world!

GOOSE	Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
MAVERICK	Right.

MAVERICK	It's a victory roll.
GOOSE	I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.

GOOSE	Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
MAVERICK	Come on, relax...
GOOSE	You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
MAVERICK	Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
GOOSE	Just once, if they take your plane away.

GOOSE	Come on, we're next.
MAVERICK	What?
GOOSE	Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.

GOOSE	Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
MAVERICK	I've had enough...for now.

GOOSE	What the hell is this?
MAVERICK	Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.

GOOSE	Something bothering you?
MAVERICK	Nothing. Let's just go fight.

MAVERICK	STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
GOOSE	Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!

GOOSE	Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
MAVERICK	I'm gonna take him, Goose.
GOOSE	Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
MAVERICK	I want him!

GOOSE	What what are you doing? We're cover!
MAVERICK	Wood's okay. I want Viper.

GOOSE	Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
MAVERICK	I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
GOOSE	Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...

MAVERICK	I'm pinned to the panel.
GOOSE	Time to go.
MAVERICK	I can't eject.

GOOSE	3000 feet. I'll do it.
MAVERICK	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!

GOOSE	1000.
MAVERICK	Let's go. Eject.

HOLLYWOOD	That's Kazanski.
GOOSE	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
HOLLYWOOD	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.

GOOSE	Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
HOLLYWOOD	Come on. I died enough for one night.

HOLLYWOOD	I was a victim of circumstance.
GOOSE	They should have warned you about that one.
HOLLYWOOD	She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
GOOSE	What'd you do?
HOLLYWOOD	Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.

GOOSE	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
STINGER	Don't.

GOOSE	He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
STINGER	Was.

STINGER	Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
GOOSE	Skipper, you can't do this!
STINGER	I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...

GOOSE	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
STINGER	Well, you'll just have to make do with him .

GOOSE	Mav's a great flyer but....
STINGER	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!

WOLFMAN	A plaque?
HOLLYWOOD	It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.

WOLFMAN	No, we...got our butts kicked.
HOLLYWOOD	Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.

WOLFMAN	It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
HOLLYWOOD	That's because you don't have any women.
WOLFMAN	Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
HOLLYWOOD	The girl with the purple fingernails?
WOLFMAN	That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.

HOLLYWOOD	Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
WOLFMAN	I didn't ruin her.

HOLLYWOOD	Hear about Ice?
WOLFMAN	What now?
HOLLYWOOD	He won again.

WOLFMAN	I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
HOLLYWOOD	GOT 'EM.

ICE	ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
MAVERICK	SHIT!!

MAVERICK	COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ICE	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.

ICE	GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
MAVERICK	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
ICE	GET LOST!
MAVERICK	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
ICE	IT'S MY SHOT.

MAVERICK	COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
ICE	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
MAVERICK	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.

MAVERICK	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
ICE	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.

MAVERICK	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ICE	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.

MAVERICK	OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ICE	LOOK OUT!

ICE	ON THE NOSE?
MAVERICK	GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

MAVERICK	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
ICE	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
MAVERICK	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
ICE	WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
MAVERICK	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2

ICE	I guess I owe you one.
MAVERICK	You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
ICE	You saved our lives. You did it!
MAVERICK	We did it.
ICE	You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
MAVERICK	No. You can be mine!

ICEMAN	Figured it out yet?
MAVERICK	Figured out what?
ICEMAN	Who is the best.
MAVERICK	Nope.
ICEMAN	Need a hint?
MAVERICK	I think I can work it out on my own.
ICEMAN	You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
MAVERICK	I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
ICEMAN	And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.

VIPER	The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
JESTER	Just below ten thousand.
VIPER	But you continued to fight.

JESTER	I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
VIPER	Tell me one thing.

JESTER	He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
VIPER	Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"

VIPER	WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
JESTER	NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.

JESTER	He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
VIPER	It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
JESTER	I've seen this before.
VIPER	So have I.
JESTER	Some guys never get it back.

JESTER	Who's the hell is that?
VIPER	Three guesses.
JESTER	Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.

MAVERICK	Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
WIZARD	Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
MAVERICK	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?

MAVERICK	I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
WIZARD	What the hell you doing?
MAVERICK	Helping him in.
WIZARD	What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.

WOLFMAN	You won?!!!
MAVERICK	Didn't everybody?

MAVERICK	It was bad.
WOLFMAN	Bad?
MAVERICK	The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.

MAVERICK	You didn't help.
WOLFMAN	No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?

MAVERICK	Morning, Coogan.
WOLFMAN	How's it goin', Coog?

MAVERICK	He's a good pilot.
STINGER	I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.

STINGER	Was going.  Now you are.
MAVERICK	Me?

STINGER	You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
MAVERICK	Sir?
STINGER	That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
MAVERICK	Yes sir!

MAVERICK	Yes sir..
STINGER	The wings..

VIPER	Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
MAVERICK	Yes sir.
VIPER	I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.

VIPER	Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
MAVERICK	Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
VIPER	You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
MAVERICK	Yes sir.
VIPER	A good man. Good flyer.

MAVERICK	I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
VIPER	Is that how you remember it?

VIPER	Why?
MAVERICK	We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
VIPER	The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?

MAVERICK	I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
VIPER	Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!

VIPER	SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
MAVERICK	ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

VIPER	Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
MAVERICK	I lost.
VIPER	Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.

MAVERICK	I can take care of myself.
VIPER	Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
MAVERICK	It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
VIPER	Then why are you here?
MAVERICK	For the same reason you are.
VIPER	Oh, you mean the thrill!
MAVERICK	The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.

VIPER	How do you feel?
MAVERICK	All right.
VIPER	Goose is dead.
MAVERICK	I know. I was there.

MAVERICK	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
VIPER	My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.

MAVERICK	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
VIPER	No bother.
MAVERICK	I called your house.
VIPER	My wife's house.
MAVERICK	She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?

VIPER	We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
MAVERICK	Or....
VIPER	Or you can quit.
MAVERICK	I don't know...
VIPER	I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.

VIPER	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
MAVERICK	You think I should quit?!
VIPER	I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.

VIPER	Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
MAVERICK	I know.
VIPER	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
MAVERICK	I'm nothing like him.
VIPER	You may not think so, but you are.
MAVERICK	He was by the book, all the way.
VIPER	They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
MAVERICK	I never heard that.
VIPER	Not something they tell dependents.
MAVERICK	It's not true.

MAVERICK	How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
VIPER	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
MAVERICK	You think I shouldn't fly.
VIPER	I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
MAVERICK	Would you take me back? Would they?
VIPER	I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.

QUAID	What's wrong with this one?
BENNY	He ain't got five kids to feed.

QUAID	Where's yours?
BENNY	Over there man.
QUAID	You got the job.

BENNY	Welcome to Mars.
QUAID	What was that?  An accident?

QUAID	What to the rebels want?
BENNY	Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.

BENNY	So, where to?
QUAID	The Last Resort.
BENNY	You're getting off to an early start.

BENNY	First time on Mars?
QUAID	Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
BENNY	Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not

QUAID	Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
BENNY	Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
QUAID	What happened to them?
BENNY	Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.

BENNY	Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
QUAID	Why not?
BENNY	I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
QUAID	And you get a kickback.

BENNY	Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
QUAID	Take me to the hotel.

QUAID	What happened to number five?
BENNY	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!

BENNY	Need a ride?
MELINA	The Last Resort!  Quick!

MELINA	Shut up and drive!
BENNY	Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!

BENNY	And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
MELINA	But maybe you can change all that.
BENNY	I think my grampa might be here.

MELINA	How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
BENNY	Hey, I got four kids to feed.

QUAID	What do you want?
CALLER	They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

CALLER	Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
QUAID	Who are you?
CALLER	Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
QUAID	How'd you find me?
CALLER	I'd advise you to hurry.

CLERK	Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
QUAID	Thank you.
CLERK	Would you like the same suite?
QUAID	Definitely.

CLERK	Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
QUAID	Get it, please.
CLERK	Identification?

CLERK	I'll go encode your room key.
QUAID	Thank you.

CLERK	There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
QUAID	May I use your pen?

COHAAGEN	Well, my boy, you're a hero.
QUAID	Fuck you.
COHAAGEN	Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.

COHAAGEN	You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
QUAID	He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
COHAAGEN	That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
QUAID	Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
COHAAGEN	He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
QUAID	So why am I still alive?
COHAAGEN	We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...

COHAAGEN	The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
QUAID	Sorry.  Too perfect.
COHAAGEN	Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.

QUAID	Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
COHAAGEN	Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
QUAID	Who is it this time--my mother?

QUAID	The guy's a fucking asshole.
COHAAGEN	Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.

QUAID	Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
COHAAGEN	My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.

QUAID	What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
COHAAGEN	Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
QUAID	Do you expect me to believe you?
COHAAGEN	Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...

COHAAGEN	I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
QUAID	I am Quaid.
COHAAGEN	You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.

COHAAGEN	What the fuck is going on down there?!
RICHTER	I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
COHAAGEN	If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
RICHTER	We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
COHAAGEN	Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
RICHTER	That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
COHAAGEN	Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.

COHAAGEN	Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
RICHTER	No, sir.
COHAAGEN	Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.

RICHTER	He had help.  From our side, sir.
COHAAGEN	I know that.
RICHTER	But I thought...
COHAAGEN	Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
RICHTER	Yes, sir.

COHAAGEN	Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
RICHTER	Yes, sir.
COHAAGEN	Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.

COHAAGEN	Stop fighting and get out.
RICHTER	They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
COHAAGEN	Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
RICHTER	Yes, sir.

RICHTER	I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
COHAAGEN	Don't be an idiot.

COHAAGEN	Kill him.
RICHTER	It's about goddamn time.

DR. LULL	Bob?
MCCLANE	What is it?
DR. LULL	You better get down here.

MCCLANE	I'm with an very important client.
DR. LULL	Looks like another schizoid embolism.

MCCLANE	What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
DR. LULL	It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.

DR. LULL	Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
MCCLANE	Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
DR. LULL	I'm afraid that's not possible.
MCCLANE	Why not?
DR. LULL	We haven't implanted it yet.

MCCLANE	Oh shit....Oh shit...
DR. LULL	I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.

MCCLANE	Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
DR. LULL	I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
MCCLANE	Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
DR. LULL	Come on...put his head in place.

DR. LULL	Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
QUAID	Nice to meet you.

QUAID	Two-headed monsters?
DR. LULL	Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.

DR. LULL	So, been married long?
QUAID	Eight years.
DR. LULL	I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
QUAID	Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.

DR. LULL	Your sexual orientation?
QUAID	Hetero.
DR. LULL	Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?

DR. LULL	Blonde, brunette, redhead?
QUAID	Brunette.
DR. LULL	Slim, athletic, voluptuous?

DR. LULL	Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
QUAID	Sleazy...and demure.
DR. LULL	Forty-one A, Ernie.

QUAID	What do you want?
EDGEMAR	This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
QUAID	I'm listening.
EDGEMAR	I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.

QUAID	Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
EDGEMAR	I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.

QUAID	Amazing.  Where are we?
EDGEMAR	At Rekall.

EDGEMAR	You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
QUAID	Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
EDGEMAR	Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
QUAID	Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
EDGEMAR	I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
QUAID	How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
EDGEMAR	Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
QUAID	Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
EDGEMAR	What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
QUAID	She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
EDGEMAR	Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
QUAID	That's right.

QUAID	You open it.
EDGEMAR	No need to be rude.  I'll do it.

QUAID	Suppose I do...then what?
EDGEMAR	Swallow this.

QUAID	What is it?
EDGEMAR	It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

EVERETT	Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
RICHTER	Any news of Quaid?
EVERETT	Not since you lost him.
RICHTER	Watch your mouth, Captain.

RICHTER	Quaid!  That's Quaid!
EVERETT	Where?
RICHTER	There!  The woman!

RICHTER	HER!
EVERETT	Arrest that woman!

EVERETT	Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
RICHTER	This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.

RICHTER	Pull them out.
EVERETT	O.K., everybody pull out!

GEORGE	Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
QUAID	Relax, you'll live longer.

GEORGE	If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
QUAID	We don't have much choice then, do we?

GEORGE	Sit down.
QUAID	Where's Kuato?
GEORGE	On his way.
GEORGE	You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
QUAID	Yeah.
GEORGE	Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
QUAID	What, aliens?
GEORGE	You tell me.
QUAID	I don't know.
GEORGE	Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
QUAID	You're Kuato, right?
GEORGE	Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.

GEORGE	Shit!
QUAID	C'mon!

GEORGE	They found us!  Everybody out!
QUAID	Melina!

QUAID	Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
HARRY	Rekall?
QUAID	They sell fake memories.
HARRY	Oh, Rekall.
QUAID	Yeah.
HARRY	RekallRekallRekall.  You thinkin' of goin' there?

QUAID	I don't know.  Maybe.
HARRY	Well don't.

QUAID	Why not?
HARRY	A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
QUAID	No shit...
HARRY	Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.

HARRY	Hey, Quaid!
QUAID	Harry!
HARRY	How was your trip to Mars?

QUAID	What trip?
HARRY	You went to Rekall, remember?
QUAID	I did?
HARRY	Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
QUAID	What are you, my father?
HARRY	Let me buy you a drink.
QUAID	No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.

QUAID	Harry, what the hell is this?
HARRY	Come on, let's go have that drink.
QUAID	What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
HARRY	You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
QUAID	Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.

HARRY	You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
QUAID	Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
HARRY	Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.

RICHTER	Where?
HELM	Up to the right.

RICHTER	I want that fucker dead.
HELM	I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
RICHTER	Are you saying she liked it?
HELM	I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.

RICHTER	What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
HELM	I've got Quaid.

RICHTER	Where is he?
HELM	Level 2.  Galleria.
RICHTER	He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.

RICHTER	Shit!
HELM	What is it?

HELM	That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
RICHTER	I've got him.  The guy in the turban.

HELM	I've got a weak signal over there.
RICHTER	Split up.  Find him.

HELM	He's not at ground level.
RICHTER	Up!

HELM	I've got a lock!  There!
RICHTER	Come on!

HELM	Look at this shit.
RICHTER	What the hell is this?

JOHNNY	I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
QUAID	How did I get in this taxi?!
JOHNNY	The door opened.  You got it.

JOHNNY	Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
QUAID	Drive!  DRIVE!!

JOHNNY	Would you please repeat the destination?
QUAID	Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!

JOHNNY	The fare is eighteen credits, please.
QUAID	Quit while you're ahead.
JOHNNY	Thanks for taking Johnnycab.

LORI	Is that better?
QUAID	Mmmm.....
LORI	Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.

QUAID	Who?
LORI	The brunette.  The one you told me about.
QUAID	Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!

LORI	Who is she?
QUAID	Nobody.
LORI	Nobody?!  What's her name?
QUAID	I don't know.
LORI	Tell me!

LORI	It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
QUAID	But I'm always home by morning.

LORI	Let me go!
QUAID	Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.

LORI	...You mean it?
QUAID	You know I do.

QUAID	Lori...
LORI	Yeah, sweetheart?
QUAID	Let's do it.
LORI	Do what?
QUAID	Move to Mars.

LORI	Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
QUAID	Just think about it.
LORI	Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
QUAID	Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
LORI	And you believe him?
QUAID	All right, forget about it.

LORI	Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
QUAID	Lori, move.
LORI	There's lots nicer places than Mars.

LORI	Well...What do you say?
QUAID	I'm late.

LORI	Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
QUAID	Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.

LORI	You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
QUAID	Bye.

LORI	What are you doing?
QUAID	Some men just tried to kill me!

LORI	Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
QUAID	No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!

QUAID	Harry from work...He was the boss.
LORI	Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
QUAID	I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
LORI	Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
QUAID	I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
LORI	You went to those brain butchers?!
QUAID	Let me finish!
LORI	What did they do to you?  Tell me!
QUAID	--I got a trip to Mars.
LORI	Oh God, Doug.
QUAID	Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
LORI	Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
QUAID	They did!  But I killed them!

QUAID	You call this a paranoid delusion?!
LORI	Doug...

QUAID	Not talk!  I said TALK!!
LORI	I'm not your wife.
QUAID	The hell you're not.
LORI	I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
QUAID	You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
LORI	It was implanted by the Agency.
QUAID	And falling in love?
LORI	Implanted.
QUAID	Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
LORI	The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
QUAID	Bullshit.

QUAID	O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
LORI	Beats me.  I just work here.

LORI	But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
QUAID	I'm honored.
LORI	You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
QUAID	I didn't know you were so kinky.
LORI	It's time you found out.

QUAID	Clever girl.
LORI	Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
QUAID	Yeah.  Some of it was fun.

QUAID	I suppose you're not here either.
LORI	I'm here at Rekall.

LORI	I love you.
QUAID	Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
LORI	Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
QUAID	Bullshit.

QUAID	Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
LORI	Doug, don't!

MCCLANE	Doug...Bob McClane.
QUAID	Nice to meet you.
MCCLANE	Good to see ya. Right this way.

MCCLANE	Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
QUAID	Mars.
MCCLANE	Right.  Mars.
QUAID	That a problem?
MCCLANE	To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
QUAID	I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
MCCLANE	Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.

MCCLANE	Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
QUAID	What's in the two week package?
MCCLANE	First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
QUAID	How real does it seem?
MCCLANE	As real as any memory in your head.
QUAID	Come on, don't bullshit me.
MCCLANE	I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
QUAID	What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
MCCLANE	You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.

QUAID	All right.
MCCLANE	Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
QUAID	No options.
MCCLANE	Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?

QUAID	I give up.
MCCLANE	You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
QUAID	I'm not interested in that.
MCCLANE	You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.

QUAID	Secret agent...How much is that?
MCCLANE	Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...

QUAID	Go on.
MCCLANE	I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?

QUAID	They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
MCCLANE	What's he talking about?
QUAID	Let me go!

QUAID	I love you.
MELINA	I love you.

MELINA	Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
QUAID	Blondes.
MELINA	I think it's still hungry.

MELINA	I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
QUAID	I guess he didn't.
MELINA	You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?

MELINA	...What?
QUAID	There's something I have to tell you...

QUAID	I don't remember you.
MELINA	What are you talking about?
QUAID	I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.

MELINA	What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
QUAID	Hauser left me a note.
MELINA	Hauser?  You're Hauser.
QUAID	Not any more.

MELINA	Hauser, you're lost your mind.
QUAID	I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
MELINA	This is too weird.
QUAID	Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
MELINA	Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?

QUAID	She wasn't really my wife.
MELINA	Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
QUAID	Forget I said wife.
MELINA	No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
QUAID	Why would I lie to you?
MELINA	Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
QUAID	Don't be ridiculous.
MELINA	You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
QUAID	Inside what?

MELINA	I think you better leave.
QUAID	Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
MELINA	I'm not falling for it.
QUAID	He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
MELINA	Get out!

MELINA	I said get out!
QUAID	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.

QUAID	I thought you didn't like me.
MELINA	If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.

QUAID	So you dropped by to apologize?
MELINA	Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!

QUAID	Now what?
MELINA	Jump!

QUAID	By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
MELINA	I used to model for 'em, why?
QUAID	Just wondering.

QUAID	Not bad, for a hooker.
MELINA	I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.

MELINA	The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
QUAID	I saw them.

QUAID	What can I do?
MELINA	Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
QUAID	Like what?
MELINA	All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
QUAID	I don't need Kuato for that.
MELINA	Oh, since when?

QUAID	He's lying.
MELINA	You two-faced-bastard.

QUAID	Are you all right?  Are you still you?
MELINA	I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?

MELINA	Where are you going?!
QUAID	The reactor.
MELINA	What reactor?!
QUAID	The one in the mine!
MELINA	People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!

MELINA	Where's this "reactor" come from?
QUAID	Aliens built it.
MELINA	Aliens?!

MELINA	You sure about this?
QUAID	It's just up ahead.

QUAID	Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
MELINA	Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.

QUAID	The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
MELINA	Enough for everybody to breathe?

MELINA	What's wrong?
QUAID	I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
MELINA	Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.

STEVENS	This is the suitcase you gave me.
QUAID	I gave you?
STEVENS	I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.

QUAID	Wait!
STEVENS	What?
QUAID	...Who are you?
STEVENS	We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
QUAID	What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!

EARL	Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
BURT	Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."

EARL	Or a big mother slug maybe?
BURT	Some kind of mutation...?

BURT	You guys all set?
EARL	Ready as we'll ever be.
BURT	Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.

BURT	You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
EARL	One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.

EARL	Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
BURT	No problem.
EARL	Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...

EARL	Yeah, like they got a plan...
BURT	Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
EARL	Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.

BURT	Yeah, still got one poking around.
EARL	That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
BURT	Roger that.

BURT	What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
EARL	You can't fight'em that way...
BURT	You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?

BURT	How much you think?
EARL	I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?

EARL	What the hell is that, anyway?
BURT	Cannon fuse.
EARL	What do <u>you</u> use it for?
BURT	My cannon.

BURT	Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
HEATHER	Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.

HEATHER	I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
BURT	Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?

HEATHER	You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
BURT	Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.

HEATHER	Knock it off, Burt!
BURT	I think I scared it!

BURT	What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
HEATHER	I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.

BURT	A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
VAL	We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!

BURT	What the hell you doing back already?
VAL	You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...

BURT	Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
VAL	Burt, can you hear me now?
BURT	Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.

VAL	Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
BURT	Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
VAL	Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
BURT	What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
VAL	Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!

VAL	Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
BURT	In a minute.

BURT	That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
VAL	Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!

VAL	Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BURT	Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?

BURT	She's got my vote.
VAL	Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.

VAL	BACK OFF, BURT...!
BURT	Well, who put you two in charge?

EARL	Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
RHONDA	Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
EARL	No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.

EARL	Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
RHONDA	I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
EARL	I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
RHONDA	Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.

EARL	Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
RHONDA	Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.

RHONDA	There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
EARL	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.

RHONDA	I might have an idea...
EARL	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
RHONDA	Well, I was wondering if we could...

EARL	I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
RHONDA	Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
EARL	You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.

EARL	You know, up the jeep trail.
RHONDA	The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.

RHONDA	Well, we can take my truck then.
EARL	No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.

RHONDA	Oh my God.
EARL	Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...

EARL	He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
RHONDA	VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!

RHONDA	We're not going over there, right?
EARL	No.  We go straight.

EARL	So...now what?
RHONDA	Could we make it to the mountains?

EARL	Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
RHONDA	Nope, there!  That's one.

RHONDA	Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
EARL	Howdy, Rhonda.
RHONDA	You're really leaving, huh?
EARL	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
RHONDA	Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.

EARL	You didn't cook breakfast?
VAL	Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
EARL	No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
VAL	Hell you did.  Your turn.

VAL	How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
EARL	I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.

VAL	If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
EARL	I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
VAL	Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
EARL	Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.

VAL	Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
EARL	Has a lot of rain.

EARL	You're gonna get us hung up.
VAL	Do not talk to the driver.

EARL	Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
VAL	Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
EARL	Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?

VAL	Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
EARL	Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
VAL	The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!

EARL	You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
VAL	What the hell do we know about seismographs?
EARL	Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
VAL	Why?
EARL	Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
VAL	Well, sure.
EARL	...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

VAL	Tammy Lynn Baxter.
EARL	Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
VAL	Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
EARL	I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.

EARL	Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
VAL	Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.

VAL	Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
EARL	You gotta ask <u>that</u>?

VAL	So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
EARL	We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
VAL	So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
EARL	Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
VAL	Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.

VAL	Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
EARL	Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!

VAL	What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
EARL	In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
VAL	I'll call that little bluff.  How close?

EARL	Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
VAL	Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

EARL	She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
VAL	That's the plan.

EARL	We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
VAL	Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!

VAL	So long, cactus!
EARL	Adios, bridge!

VAL	Jeez, look at that guy.
EARL	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
VAL	Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.

EARL	You're full of shit.
VAL	He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.

EARL	Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
VAL	If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
EARL	Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
VAL	Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
EARL	Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?

VAL	Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
EARL	You got that right.

VAL	Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
EARL	Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
VAL	I'll go with that plan.

EARL	Oh, Jesus!!
VAL	What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!

VAL	Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
EARL	Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.

VAL	Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
EARL	Val!  Val!

VAL	Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
EARL	You're hung up again.
VAL	I am not!

VAL	Fuck you!
EARL	Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!

EARL	It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
VAL	Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!

EARL	Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
VAL	Fifteen lousy bucks.
EARL	A man who plans ahead.

VAL	Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
EARL	Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
VAL	Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.

EARL	You want the rifle or the Smith?
VAL	The rifle.

EARL	That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
VAL	Great.  Thank you.

EARL	Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
VAL	Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?

EARL	Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
VAL	That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
EARL	<u>Why</u> would they do it?

EARL	Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
VAL	Oh shit!

EARL	What the hell are they?
VAL	Sons of bitches!

EARL	This is one big mother!
VAL	So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?

EARL	Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
VAL	Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!

EARL	Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
VAL	You got <u>that</u> right!

EARL	Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
VAL	Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.

VAL	We'll take your word for it.
EARL	Yeah.  Where's your truck?

EARL	Prairie dog burrow...
VAL	Little sons of bitches.

VAL	God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
EARL	Okay, now, how far's your truck?

VAL	I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
EARL	I think we wait right here.

EARL	Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
VAL	Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
EARL	Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

VAL	Son of a bitch!
EARL	Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
VAL	It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...

EARL	You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
VAL	Me, too.

EARL	Well, folks, what's the plan?
VAL	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

EARL	Don't he have a home to go to?
VAL	Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

EARL	Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
VAL	Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...

EARL	You go north, I'll go south.
VAL	Right.

EARL	You're right, don't matter where they come from.
VAL	Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.

EARL	I'm gonna kick his ass!
VAL	I'm gonna help you.

EARL	Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
VAL	Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.

VAL	How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
EARL	Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
VAL	We need another plan.

EARL	Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
VAL	Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
EARL	Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.

VAL	But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
EARL	A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
VAL	Its tires are flat...
EARL	Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
VAL	Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
EARL	We got a plan!

VAL	<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
EARL	Like hell you are.
VAL	Get real.  I'm faster than you.
EARL	<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
VAL	Only if something happens to me.

VAL	Watch your ass, shithead.
EARL	Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

VAL	Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
EARL	I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.

VAL	Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
EARL	Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

EARL	Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
VAL	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.

VAL	Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
EARL	Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...

VAL	They're...they're trying to make us move!
EARL	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
VAL	It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.

EARL	Use the fucking bomb!
VAL	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
EARL	I want to live for the three days.

EARL	What the hell are you doing?!!
VAL	I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

EARL	Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
VAL	Not yet, not yet...

EARL	Road's in!
VAL	Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
EARL	<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
VAL	Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
EARL	Yeah...but no ties.
VAL	No ties.

EARL	Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
VAL	Civil?  I'm civil.
EARL	You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.

VAL	Somebody paying you to do this?
EARL	She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

EARL	Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
VAL	What?
EARL	She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
VAL	You are so full of shit...
EARL	Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.

OLD FRED	How's she doing?
EDGAR	She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.

OLD FRED	Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
EDGAR	Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
OLD FRED	Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
EDGAR	If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

OLD FRED	We playing cards tonight?
EDGAR	I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
OLD FRED	I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
EDGAR	You bet.

HEATHER	Hi, guys, what you been up to?
VAL	Ran into the new college student, Rona.

HEATHER	Down, honey, down.
VAL	Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.

VAL	Burt!  Heather!
HEATHER	Yeah, Val.
VAL	We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.

HEATHER	We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
VAL	They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!

HEATHER	Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
VAL	Yeah, Heather, we got you.

JIM	I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
MEGAN	We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
JIM	The con...!  Oh my God.
MEGAN	Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
JIM	What?
MEGAN	That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
JIM	Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.

MEGAN	Well, what's wrong with it?
JIM	It's...gone...!

MEGAN	You sure this is where it was?
JIM	Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.

MEGAN	Come on.  Get away from it!
JIM	God, what a stink!

PHAM VAN	Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
VAL	Could be.

PHAM VAN	And I appreciate it.
VAL	You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.

VAL	I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
PHAM VAN	I didn't do it!  What's going on?

VAL	Twenty.
PHAM VAN	Okay, ten dollars.

PHAM VAN	I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
VAL	Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!

RHONDA	Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
VAL	Yeah, geography.
RHONDA	Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.

RHONDA	Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
VAL	Around here?  Why would they?
RHONDA	Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
VAL	Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
RHONDA	Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.

RHONDA	Darn it!
VAL	You okay?
RHONDA	Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.

VAL	Think it's still following us?
RHONDA	Let's assume that it is.

RHONDA	Ready?
VAL	Yeah.  One, two, three...

VAL	Rhonda's got an idea about that.
RHONDA	Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.

VAL	You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
RHONDA	It does.

VAL	What's it doing?
RHONDA	Why do you all keep asking me?

RHONDA	Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
VAL	They're working together, too.

VAL	What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
RHONDA	You guys do all the odd jobs.

RHONDA	Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
VAL	Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!

RHONDA	Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
VAL	Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.

VAL	I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
RHONDA	Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
VAL	Good point.

RHONDA	It worked!  There they go!
VAL	LET'S DO IT!

ALONZO HOGUE	Looks almost cold now, don't it?
WASH PERRY	That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
ALONZO HOGUE	Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
WASH PERRY	Let's go.

WASH PERRY	It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
ALONZO HOGUE	Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
WASH PERRY	It's no meteor, that's for sure!
ALONZO HOGUE	Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!

WASH PERRY	We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
ALONZO HOGUE	We'd be in all the papers!
WASH PERRY	Hey, how about that!
ALONZO HOGUE	We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!

WASH PERRY	Hey, there - open up!
ALONZO HOGUE	Come on out!  We're friends!

SECRETARY	That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
CHIEF OF STAFF	Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
SECRETARY	The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?

CHIEF OF STAFF	Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
SECRETARY	All right - I've seen enough!

SECRETARY	There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
CHIEF OF STAFF	Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
SECRETARY	I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.

M.P. DRIVER	Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
CLAYTON	I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
M.P. DRIVER	There's nobody left around here now.
CLAYTON	We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!

M.P. DRIVER	Hurry up!  Jump in!
CLAYTON	There was a girl with them...If I could find her....

M.P. DRIVER	You look kinda lost yourself.
CLAYTON	But I think I know where she'll be....

CLAYTON	Is that it over there?
SYLVIA	Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.

SYLVIA	Did you see it come down?
CLAYTON	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
SYLVIA	You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
CLAYTON	Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
SYLVIA	It hit sideways and skidded in.

CLAYTON	What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
SYLVIA	He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!

CLAYTON	You seem to know a lot about him.
SYLVIA	Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
CLAYTON	Did it do you any good?
SYLVIA	Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
CLAYTON	I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
SYLVIA	Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
CLAYTON	Aw, he isn't that good...!
SYLVIA	How can you say that when you don't know him!

CLAYTON	I do know him...slightly.
SYLVIA	What's he like?
CLAYTON	Like...ah...

SYLVIA	Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
CLAYTON	I didn't know how to stop you...!
SYLVIA	I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
CLAYTON	They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.

SYLVIA	They've all stopped at the same time.
CLAYTON	There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?

SYLVIA	How does it happen cars are running?
CLAYTON	Automobile ignitions are insulated.

CLAYTON	The troops are certainly moving in here!
SYLVIA	Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
CLAYTON	I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
SYLVIA	You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!

CLAYTON	Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
SYLVIA	Would you like some coffee, General?

CLAYTON	We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
SYLVIA	Can you handle one of these?
CLAYTON	Sure...get in!

SYLVIA	You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
CLAYTON	No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!

SYLVIA	I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
CLAYTON	I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.

SYLVIA	Is that... machine...?
CLAYTON	It's gone now.
SYLVIA	Where are we?
CLAYTON	Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!

CLAYTON	I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
SYLVIA	Don't you live at home?
CLAYTON	No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
SYLVIA	I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
CLAYTON	I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.

CLAYTON	A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
SYLVIA	It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
CLAYTON	We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
SYLVIA	But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
CLAYTON	If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!

CLAYTON	I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
SYLVIA	I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.

SYLVIA	I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
CLAYTON	I liked him.

SYLVIA	He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
CLAYTON	But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.

CLAYTON	How long was I out?
SYLVIA	Hours.  I've been so scared...!

CLAYTON	Nothing there now.
SYLVIA	It was...  ...one of them!
CLAYTON	What was it like?
SYLVIA	I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
CLAYTON	We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.

CLAYTON	Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
SYLVIA	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
CLAYTON	Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.

SYLVIA	They've blocked it!
CLAYTON	It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!

SYLVIA	Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
CLAYTON	Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
SYLVIA	Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
CLAYTON	I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
SYLVIA	My kid brother has one.  You know why?
CLAYTON	Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
SYLVIA	How'd you guess?
CLAYTON	That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!

CLAYTON	The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
SYLVIA	I wonder if they're going through this too...?

SYLVIA	I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
CLAYTON	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
SYLVIA	Don't let's lose each other.

CLAYTON	That's what knocked the phones out, too.
SHERIFF	How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
CLAYTON	Have you got a pocket compass?

SHERIFF	That needle ain't pointing north!
CLAYTON	It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.

SHERIFF	What is that gizmo?!
CLAYTON	I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
SHERIFF	We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!

CLAYTON	This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
GRATZMAN	It might give us something.

CLAYTON	A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
GRATZMAN	It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
CLAYTON	I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.

CLAYTON	We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
GRATZMAN	If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...

CLAYTON	Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
GRATZMAN	No.  I thought you had them.
CLAYTON	All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.

FIDDLER	I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
CLAYTON	Right.
FIDDLER	Looks like the fishing was good.

FIDDLER	It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
CLAYTON	Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
FIDDLER	That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
CLAYTON	I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.

COLONEL	There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
PASTOR COLLINS	So is the town, I notice!
COLONEL	I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
PASTOR COLLINS	I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.

PASTOR COLLINS	Colonel - shooting's no good!
COLONEL	It's always been a good persuader.
PASTOR COLLINS	Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?

COLONEL	General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
GENERAL MANN	I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.

GENERAL MANN	That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
COLONEL	Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
GENERAL MANN	And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.

COLONEL	We will, sir!
GENERAL MANN	From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?

COLONEL	My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
GENERAL MANN	That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
COLONEL	Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
GENERAL MANN	They'll probably move at dawn.

PASTOR COLLINS	That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
SYLVIA	It was nearer than that.

SYLVIA	Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
PASTOR COLLINS	Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!

SYLVIA	They don't do much of anything...!
PASTOR COLLINS	There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.

PASTOR COLLINS	They are living creatures out there.
SYLVIA	But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
PASTOR COLLINS	If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!

SYLVIA	Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
PASTOR COLLINS	I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.

RANGER	Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
RADIO VOICE	D.O. to number three..come in.
RANGER	We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
RADIO VOICE	Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
RANGER	I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
RADIO VOICE	Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?

WASH PERRY	Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
SALVADOR	We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!

WASH PERRY	Must be somebody in there.
SALVADOR	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
WASH PERRY	How would I know...!

SALVADOR	Maybe these are not men - not like us.
WASH PERRY	Everything human don't have to look like you and me....

SALVADOR	What'll we say to 'em?
WASH PERRY	Welcome to California!

WASH PERRY	They'll understand us, all right!
SALVADOR	Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.

BAIN	Is there a problem?
RATH	No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
BAIN	Right.

BAIN	Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
RATH	Where?
BAIN	What?
RATH	What restaurant?
BAIN	Uh, Fontella's
RATH	So you're from around here?
BAIN	No.  No I'm not.

RATH	Where you from?
BAIN	What is this?
RATH	Not too good at small talk, eh?
BAIN	Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
RATH	I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.

BAIN	Why?  What happened?
RATH	Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
BAIN	No shit.
RATH	Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
BAIN	Yeah.
RATH	But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
BAIN	Probably.
RATH	I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.

BAIN	What are you doing?
RATH	What?
BAIN	That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
RATH	You're right.  Talking too much again.
BAIN	Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
RATH	What?  You think I'm running you up?
BAIN	Just do your job.

BAIN	What are you doing?
RATH	Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
BAIN	You can't --
RATH	The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!

RATH	Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
BAIN	No fucking way.
RATH	Okay, don't.

BAIN	Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
RATH	What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
BAIN	Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.

BAIN	Bain.  Michael Bain.
RATH	How long have you been freelance?
BAIN	Two years.  Two long fucking years.

BAIN	Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
RATH	It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
BAIN	Sounds like chickenshit --

BAIN	You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
RATH	We both know what you were doing.

BAIN	Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
RATH	Tachlinkov.
BAIN	Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?

BAIN	Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
RATH	After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
BAIN	Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.

BAIN	So what happens now?
RATH	We go around once.
BAIN	Bullshit.

RATH	Okay.
BAIN	What?  What's okay?

BAIN	What are you doing?
RATH	There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.

BAIN	No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
RATH	I know you're going to jump.

BAIN	How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
RATH	I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
BAIN	What does that fucking mean?
RATH	It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.

RATH	Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
BAIN	I ain't scared of you.
RATH	Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
BAIN	If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
RATH	All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.

BAIN	Five million dollars?
RATH	That's right.
BAIN	Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.

RATH	Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
BAIN	What?
RATH	You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
BAIN	Oh, yeah.
RATH	What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.

BAIN	You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
RATH	You would be.
BAIN	You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
RATH	Why don't you tell me.
BAIN	I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
RATH	Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.

BAIN	Game over, bitch!
RATH	Bain!

BAIN	I'm on the scent.
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	You're too late.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Michael?
BAIN	No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
BAIN	What?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Such language in front of a lady.
BAIN	I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --

BAIN	How in the fuck do you know that?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Do you want Rath or not?

RATH	Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
CABBY	Sure.

RATH	Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
CABBY	Yes, sir.

RATH	No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
CABBY	Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
RATH	No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
CABBY	I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
RATH	Take us there.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Where have you been, Robert?
RATH/SCREEN	Sick.  The flu.
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	I don't believe you.

RATH/SCREEN	Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	I'm worried about you, Robert.

RATH/SCREEN	What?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	The contract was stolen.

RATH/SCREEN	Who?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.

RATH/SCREEN	How did he know?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Know what?
RATH/SCREEN	The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.

RATH/SCREEN	I don't know what the fuck you are.
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	I know.  It was a joke.

RATH/SCREEN	Deadline?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.

RATH/SCREEN	Who is the mark?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Hello, Robert.
RATH/SCREEN	The contract?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Paid in full.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
RATH	Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	I know what happened.
RATH	I bet you fucking know!
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	It cost us.

RATH	I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	He stole another contract.

RATH	Is this how it went, Nick?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	Robert?  Robert?

RATH	You think this is a fucking joke?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	$1,000,000.

RATH	A player?
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN	We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'

ELECTRA	What?
RATH	He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
ELECTRA	Um, five.
RATH	One hour per man.

RATH	Get on the expressway.
ELECTRA	Where are we going?

RATH	Nikita?  She helped me find you.
ELECTRA	What?  How did you know I had a cat?
RATH	Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
ELECTRA	Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
RATH	I work for the government.
ELECTRA	Yeah?

ELECTRA	Bullshit.
RATH	Yeah.
ELECTRA	You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
RATH	I'm part of the game, just like you.

RATH	Twenty large?  That's all?
ELECTRA	What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
RATH	The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.

RATH	I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
ELECTRA	Ten million --
RATH	Now you understand why I'm here.

ELECTRA	Now what?
RATH	Turn off the engine.

ELECTRA	You want me to pump?
RATH	No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.

ELECTRA	Okay.  How did you find me?
RATH	You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
ELECTRA	You didn't know anything about me.

ELECTRA	Nikita?
RATH	Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.

ELECTRA	You're one of them, aren't you?
RATH	'Them'?
ELECTRA	An assassin?
RATH	Until a minute ago.
ELECTRA	What does that mean?
RATH	If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.

ELECTRA	Who is that other guy?
RATH	Another contractor.
ELECTRA	Someone hired both of you?
RATH	No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
ELECTRA	So this is something between you and him?
RATH	He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because he is trying to retire me.
ELECTRA	He wants to kill you?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
ELECTRA	And you want to use me to get him?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	Forget it!
RATH	We don't have a choice.

ELECTRA	Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
RATH	Right.
ELECTRA	I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
RATH	It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
ELECTRA	I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
RATH	If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.

ELECTRA	I don't need the money.
RATH	This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
ELECTRA	Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
RATH	If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
ELECTRA	You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
RATH	No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
ELECTRA	How?
RATH	Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.

ELECTRA	Oh Jesus Jesus...
RATH	He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.

ELECTRA	Listen -- I don't even know your name.
RATH	Rath.  Robert Rath.
ELECTRA	Electra.
RATH	Just Electra?
ELECTRA	Yeah.
RATH	As in daughter of Agamemnon?
ELECTRA	No.  Just Electra.

ELECTRA	What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
RATH	What do you want to know?
ELECTRA	If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?

RATH	No.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because I'm done.
ELECTRA	This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?

ELECTRA	With computers.
RATH	It's not the same, is it?
ELECTRA	Better than playing with yourself.

ELECTRA	Had?
RATH	He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.

ELECTRA	It looks like white's game.
RATH	We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
ELECTRA	Why didn't you finish this game?

RATH	He was... taken.
ELECTRA	He was killed.

RATH	I killed him.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
ELECTRA	Where you wanted to be?
RATH	Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
ELECTRA	How did you get into the business?
RATH	The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
ELECTRA	The C.I.A.?
RATH	More or less.
ELECTRA	How old were you?
RATH	They recruited me when I was in high school.
ELECTRA	Jesus -- why?
RATH	Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
ELECTRA	You were like a boy genius?
RATH	Some people said that.  I never thought so.
ELECTRA	Why not?
RATH	I was just different.
ELECTRA	You went from high school to the Agency?
RATH	No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
ELECTRA	They didn't give you a choice, did they?
RATH	No, they didn't.
ELECTRA	But you knew what they were training you for?
RATH	Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
ELECTRA	Ahhhh...
RATH	They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
ELECTRA	The exotic women.
RATH	Women?  No... not really.
ELECTRA	Why not?
RATH	Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because you are a women.
ELECTRA	Why did you leave the Agency?
RATH	The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
ELECTRA	They tried to kill you?
RATH	Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
ELECTRA	Then you went freelance?
RATH	The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
ELECTRA	Tell me about the first time.
RATH	My first take?
ELECTRA	Yes.
RATH	Why?
ELECTRA	Because I want to know.
RATH	It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
ELECTRA	Are they usually like that?
RATH	No.  Just the first one.
ELECTRA	After that?
RATH	They become complicated... messy.
ELECTRA	Did it ever bother you?
RATH	Did it ever bother James Bond?
ELECTRA	That's fiction.
RATH	This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
ELECTRA	Does that mean it didn't bother you?

RATH	Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
ELECTRA	No.  Something honest.

RATH	It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
ELECTRA	You said you didn't trust it.
RATH	I don't.

RATH	Do you have a passport?
ELECTRA	Several.
RATH	Good.
ELECTRA	Where is it?
RATH	Mexico.

ELECTRA	Hey, where are you?
RATH	Thinking.
ELECTRA	About?
RATH	Nothing.

ELECTRA	I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
RATH	I don't know.
ELECTRA	You were there?

RATH	That's where he'll be.
ELECTRA	What?
RATH	I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.

RATH	No.
ELECTRA	Why not?
RATH	It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
ELECTRA	Oh.  What do you think about?
RATH	Work.  The things I need to get done.

ELECTRA	Do you think about the game?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	But you've never figured out a way to win.
RATH	No.
ELECTRA	Not even a stalemate?
RATH	No.
ELECTRA	What happens if you do?

ELECTRA	What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
RATH	I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
ELECTRA	That sounds nice.

ELECTRA	I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
RATH	You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.

ELECTRA	Do you think he's here?
RATH	Here?
ELECTRA	In Costa Blanca.
RATH	Yes.

ELECTRA	What do you think he's doing?
RATH	I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.

RATH	Breakfast.
ELECTRA	Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.

ELECTRA	I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
RATH	Okay.
ELECTRA	Really?
RATH	He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
ELECTRA	Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.

RATH	You should knock.
ELECTRA	Sorry.
RATH	How was the beach?
ELECTRA	The beach?  It was nice.

ELECTRA	Where did you learn it?
RATH	Taiwan.
ELECTRA	Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
RATH	Thank you.
ELECTRA	I've always wanted to learn something like that.
RATH	You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.

ELECTRA	Two way?
RATH	Transmits and receives.
ELECTRA	Cheap as shit.

RATH	I paid a lot for these.
ELECTRA	They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
RATH	It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
ELECTRA	Fine.

RATH	This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
ELECTRA	Check.
RATH	He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
ELECTRA	But he won't shoot you right then?
RATH	No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.

RATH	You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
ELECTRA	Okay.  Then what?
RATH	Then, we wait.
ELECTRA	Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
RATH	It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.

RATH	The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
ELECTRA	Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
RATH	He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
ELECTRA	What?  What if he brings it with him?

RATH	He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
ELECTRA	That means you won't have a gun.
RATH	That's right.
ELECTRA	And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
RATH	If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
ELECTRA	You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
RATH	I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
ELECTRA	We split the money?
RATH	Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
ELECTRA	Sounds pretty well figured out.
RATH	I've been thinking about it for a long time.
ELECTRA	Except --
RATH	What?
ELECTRA	Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
RATH	I told you, he will.
ELECTRA	You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
RATH	I was.

RATH	Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
ELECTRA	For Nicholai?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?

ELECTRA	What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
RATH	I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
ELECTRA	I don't believe that.
RATH	It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
ELECTRA	Ten years ago.
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	What happened?
RATH	I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
ELECTRA	What did he want?
RATH	He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
RATH	What did he say?
RATH	He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
ELECTRA	Was that it?
RATH	Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
ELECTRA	You didn't take it.
RATH	No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
ELECTRA	Ten years later, here you are again.
RATH	Yes.  Here I am again.

ELECTRA	Do you have ulcers?
RATH	No.
ELECTRA	I think I got one today.
RATH	Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.

RATH	Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
ELECTRA	I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
RATH	They're worth less points.
ELECTRA	So?

ELECTRA	Did you think they were newlyweds?
RATH	I didn't notice them.
ELECTRA	When I first saw them I thought they were married.
RATH	How do you know they're not?
ELECTRA	I went into their room this afternoon.
RATH	What?
ELECTRA	It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
RATH	Jesus, if someone had --
ELECTRA	Nobody ever sees me.
RATH	Why in the hell would you take that chance?
ELECTRA	I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.

ELECTRA	She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
RATH	Thank you.
ELECTRA	Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
RATH	No.
ELECTRA	No?
RATH	It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
ELECTRA	I know.  It makes me crazy.
RATH	Why?
ELECTRA	I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
RATH	And you were drilling these holes...?
ELECTRA	So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
RATH	Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
ELECTRA	He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
RATH	Did he explain how this happened?
ELECTRA	He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.

RATH	What are you doing?
ELECTRA	What?
RATH	That's a ridiculous move.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Because, I'll take it.
ELECTRA	I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.

ELECTRA	Can I ask you something?
RATH	I'm sure you will.
ELECTRA	Am I attractive?

RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	Are you attracted to me?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	Why?
RATH	Why?  I don't know.
ELECTRA	Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
RATH	Both.

ELECTRA	Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
RATH	I didn't want to complicate the situation.
ELECTRA	Attraction is a complication?
RATH	It can be.
ELECTRA	It happened to you before?
RATH	Yes.
ELECTRA	Who was she?
RATH	Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
ELECTRA	What happened to her?
RATH	She was taken.
ELECTRA	Did you --
RATH	No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
ELECTRA	Was she the only one?
RATH	After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
ELECTRA	Is this becoming complicated?
RATH	I'm not sure that I care anymore.

ELECTRA	Were you attracted to me right away?
RATH	No.
ELECTRA	When did it start?
RATH	Honestly?
ELECTRA	Uh-huh.
RATH	When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
ELECTRA	Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
RATH	Why?
ELECTRA	That doesn't sound normal.
RATH	I'm not normal.
ELECTRA	I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.

RATH	Martin.
ELECTRA	Martin.

RATH	Four minutes.
ELECTRA	What?
RATH	I waited another four minutes.
ELECTRA	Shit.
RATH	Wait until he is on the stairs.
ELECTRA	Right.
RATH	I'm taking off my mike.
ELECTRA	Okay.
RATH	Electra --
ELECTRA	What?
RATH	Last night --

ELECTRA	Was nice.
RATH	Yes.

RATH	He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
ELECTRA	Oh, God.  I see it!

ELECTRA	I wasn't watching television.
WOMAN	The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
ELECTRA	I thought it was interesting --
WOMAN	God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
ELECTRA	Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
WOMAN	Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
ELECTRA	I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
WOMAN	Electra --
ELECTRA	A pleasure doing business with you.

ESCORT	Hi.  Did you call --
RATH	Yes.  Please come in.

RATH	I prefer it like this.
ESCORT	How can a beautiful man like you be shy?

RATH	Would you like a drink?
ESCORT	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.

RATH	Why are you working today?
ESCORT	Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.

RATH	You're very good at this aren't you?
ESCORT	I think you're supposed to answer that question.

ESCORT	That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
RATH	I called because I just want... I need to talk.

ESCORT	For what?
RATH	Honesty.

RATH	Do you ever regret things you've done?
ESCORT	Everyone regrets something.
RATH	But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
ESCORT	Sometimes.
RATH	Do you think about their wives or their families?
ESCORT	No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.

RATH	Do you ever think about starting over?
ESCORT	All the time.
RATH	Can you tell me about it?

ESCORT	Then, I'll sail alone.
RATH	Do you believe that?
ESCORT	Are you asking me if I believe in another life?

ESCORT	Is that all you want?
RATH	Yes.

RATH	Thank you.
ESCORT	Anytime.

KETCHAM	How much farther?
RATH	Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.

KETCHAM	Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
RATH	Sure.
KETCHAM	Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
RATH	Why not?
KETCHAM	I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.

KETCHAM	I think I've heard of you.
RATH	It's possible.
KETCHAM	You're pretty famous aren't you?
RATH	I hope not.
KETCHAM	I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
RATH	It's a common question.
KETCHAM	Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
RATH	A dime.
KETCHAM	One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
RATH	Average.
KETCHAM	Shit... oh well.

KETCHAM	I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
RATH	Taken.
KETCHAM	'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
RATH	Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
KETCHAM	That's exactly what I told myself.

RATH	Don't know.  That's how it works.
KETCHAM	That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
RATH	Right.
KETCHAM	I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
RATH	What are you thinking about?
KETCHAM	I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
RATH	And an R.C.

KETCHAM	Can I ask you something?
RATH	Go ahead.
KETCHAM	What do other guys do?

RATH	Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
KETCHAM	Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
RATH	Some.
KETCHAM	When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
RATH	Can I ask you a question?
KETCHAM	Anything.
RATH	Why didn't you fade?
KETCHAM	You mean quit?
RATH	Yeah.
KETCHAM	I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
RATH	Yeah.

KETCHAM	Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
RATH	No.

OFFICIAL	You wish to close this account today?
RATH	That's correct.
OFFICIAL	How would you like the funds?
RATH	American currency.
OFFICIAL	This will take some time.
RATH	I have all day.

OFFICIAL	Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
RATH	I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
OFFICIAL	Of course, senor.
RATH	Thank you.

ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
BRUCE	No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.

BRUCE	It's cold.
ALFRED	It's vichyssoise, sir.
BRUCE	Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?

ALFRED	I suppose you feel better now, sir.
BRUCE	No, actually I feel worse.

BRUCE	Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
ALFRED	Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
BRUCE	'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
ALFRED	I will relay the message.
BRUCE	Alright, thanks.

BRUCE	Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
BRUCE	Affair ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
ALFRED	I think I'll take the stairs.

ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
BRUCE	I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
ALFRED	Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
BRUCE	You'll never guess.

BRUCE	I guess this mean we won.
ALFRED	Yes, I suppose that we did.

ALFRED	Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
BRUCE	Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."

CATWOMAN	Where's the fire?
BATMAN	Shreck's.  You --

CATWOMAN	How could you?  I'm a woman...
BATMAN	I'm -- sorry, I --

CATWOMAN	As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
BATMAN	Hanging on every word.
CATWOMAN	Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?

BATMAN	A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
CATWOMAN	Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
BATMAN	I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...

CATWOMAN	I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
BATMAN	...four, five.

CATWOMAN	Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
BATMAN	We do.

BATMAN	A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
CATWOMAN	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.

CATWOMAN	You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
BATMAN	I tried to grab you -- save you --
CATWOMAN	Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.

BATMAN	First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
CATWOMAN	Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
BATMAN	Wrong on both counts.

BATMAN	Admiring your handiwork?
PENGUIN	Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
BATMAN	You're not the Mayor.
PENGUIN	Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.

BATMAN	Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
PENGUIN	Better than you know, Bat-boy.
BATMAN	What're you really after?
PENGUIN	Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
BATMAN	Things change.

PENGUIN	I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
BATMAN	Maybe you're right.

BRUCE	We've met.
SELINA	Have we?

BRUCE	Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
SELINA	You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
BRUCE	Didn't I say that?
SELINA	Yes and no ...

SELINA	You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
BRUCE	No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
SELINA	Well that's a ... long story ...
BRUCE	Well, I could ... free up some time...
SELINA	I'm listed.
BRUCE	I'm tempted.

SELINA	Pouring myself into my work.
BRUCE	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
SELINA	Oh.  "Kyle."

BRUCE	Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
SELINA	Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
BRUCE	I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
SELINA	Treat to be here.

SELINA	The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
BRUCE	And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
SELINA	I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?

SELINA	You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
BRUCE	I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
SELINA	-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.

BRUCE	You almost sound enthusiastic.
SELINA	I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
BRUCE	You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
SELINA	No darker than yours, Bruce.
BRUCE	Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
SELINA	Yeah?  Me too...

BRUCE	... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
SELINA	We?  You and...
BRUCE	... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
SELINA	Yes and no...

SELINA	I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
BRUCE	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
SELINA	Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
BRUCE	Had one.  Didn't work.
SELINA	What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
BRUCE	Nope, I told her everything.
SELINA	And the truth frightened her?
BRUCE	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
SELINA	Vicki.  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
BRUCE	Photojournalist.
SELINA	Sure.

SELINA	Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
BRUCE	If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.

SELINA	It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
BRUCE	Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.

BRUCE	I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
SELINA	Nor I, on the second.
BRUCE	What're you doing three dates from now?

BRUCE	Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
SELINA	'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
BRUCE	No hard feelings?

SELINA	There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
BRUCE	Y'mean take off our costumes?
SELINA	Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
BRUCE	Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
SELINA	You first.

SELINA	Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
BRUCE	Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
SELINA	I don't know anymore, Bruce ...

SELINA	A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
BRUCE	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.

SELINA	... What do we do?
BRUCE	I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.

BRUCE	Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
MAX	Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
BRUCE	No.  No glass on the inside.
MAX	Weird, huh?

MAX	I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
BRUCE	Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.

MAX	If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
BRUCE	Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
MAX	Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
BRUCE	I'm not scared of you, Max.

BRUCE	Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
MAX	Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
BRUCE	Oswald is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
MAX	Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --

BRUCE	What happened?
MAX	Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?

MAX	Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
BRUCE	Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
MAX	I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
BRUCE	It does to me.
MAX	Yawn.

MAX	I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
CATWOMAN	Your blood, Max.
MAX	My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
CATWOMAN	A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.

MAX	Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
CATWOMAN	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
MAX	Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.

MAX	Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
CATWOMAN	He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
MAX	Was.

CATWOMAN	You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
MAX	One way to find out?

PENGUIN	I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
CATWOMAN	Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
PENGUIN	Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
CATWOMAN	Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
PENGUIN	Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?

PENGUIN	Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
CATWOMAN	I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
PENGUIN	Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.

PENGUIN	We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
CATWOMAN	He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.

PENGUIN	Y'mean frame him?
CATWOMAN	You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.

PENGUIN	Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
CATWOMAN	You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.

CATWOMAN	He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
PENGUIN	Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
CATWOMAN	I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...

PENGUIN	Let's consummate our fiendish union!
CATWOMAN	I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
PENGUIN	I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
CATWOMAN	Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!

CATWOMAN	Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
PENGUIN	The name is Oswald Cobblepot.

MAX	Son!
CHIP	Dad!  Save yourself!

MAX	I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
CHIP	She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
MAX	Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
CHIP	PMS.

CHIP	You buy this "blurry" business?
MAX	Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.

FAT CLOWN	Ten, nine...
PENGUIN	The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
FAT CLOWN	... eight, seven...
PENGUIN	Silent night, violent night...
FAT CLOWN	All is shrill, all is blight...

FAT CLOWN	Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
PENGUIN	But who could've ... no, don't say it.
FAT CLOWN	My lips are sealed.

PENGUIN	Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
MAX	My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
PENGUIN	Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?

MAX	What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
PENGUIN	No, just give you a splitting headache.
MAX	Well it's not working.

PENGUIN	Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
MAX	And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?

MAX	Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
PENGUIN	What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
MAX	If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.

PENGUIN	A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
MAX	Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --

MAX	You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
PENGUIN	You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

MAX	Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
PENGUIN	A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?

PENGUIN	Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
MAX	Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
PENGUIN	Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?

PENGUIN	Wonder if it's worth my time.
MAX	We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
PENGUIN	I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
MAX	Oswald:  We need one more thing.
PENGUIN	A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
MAX	That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
PENGUIN	You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot.  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"

MAX	Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
PENGUIN	... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...

PENGUIN	I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
MAX	Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
PENGUIN	Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
MAX	Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...

PENGUIN	He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
MAX	Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...

PENGUIN	Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
MAX	I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.

PENGUIN	You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
MAX	Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
PENGUIN	I don't.  So, no.
MAX	I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
PENGUIN	Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.

MAX	Working late?  I'm touched.
SELINA	No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --

MAX	Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
SELINA	Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...

SELINA	Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
MAX	And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?

MAX	... Where did curiosity get the cat?
SELINA	I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
MAX	And a very, very good one.
SELINA	Too good?

SELINA	It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
MAX	I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.

SELINA	Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
MAX	Actually, it's a lot like that.

MAX	Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
SELINA	That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
MAX	Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.

SELINA	Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
MAX	I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
SELINA	Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.

BARBARA	How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
ALFRED	Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.

ALFRED	Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
BARBARA	Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
ALFRED	Eventually she married a young physician.

ALFRED	You certainly will not.
BARBARA	Oh no, those things frighten me.

BARBARA	I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
ALFRED	You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.

BARBARA	I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
ALFRED	I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
BARBARA	It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
ALFRED	As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.

BARBARA	I'm sorry.  I was too late.
ALFRED	Too late for what, dear child?
BARBARA	I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
ALFRED	I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.

ALFRED	Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
BARBARA	What is it?
ALFRED	It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.

BARBARA	Uncle Alfred?
ALFRED	In spirit only, I'm afraid.
BARBARA	The boys need help.

BRUCE	He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
ALFRED	Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
BRUCE	Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
ALFRED	Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.

ALFRED	I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
BRUCE	No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.

BRUCE	You have?
ALFRED	Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?

BRUCE	Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
ALFRED	There's a lovely inn just down --

ALFRED	Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
BRUCE	Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.

ALFRED	Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
BRUCE	Thanks.

ALFRED	Is there something wrong, sir?
BRUCE	Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
ALFRED	Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.

BRUCE	But I can't can I?
ALFRED	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.

ALFRED	I am as well as can be expected.
BRUCE	Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
ALFRED	I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.

BRUCE	Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
ALFRED	Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
BRUCE	Not all heroes wear masks.

BRUCE	Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
ALFRED	Yes?

BRUCE	I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
ALFRED	Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.

BRUCE	I love you, old man.
ALFRED	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.

BRUCE	Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
ALFRED	Right here, sir.

BRUCE	It's good to see you.
ALFRED	What seems to be the problem?
BRUCE	Women.
ALFRED	That, sir, does not compute.
BRUCE	First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
ALFRED	Specify, please.
BRUCE	Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
ALFRED	Coming on line now, sir.

ALFRED	Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
BRUCE	Pheromones?
ALFRED	Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
BRUCE	Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.

BRUCE	What is it?
ALFRED	It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.

BRUCE	Alfred, are you...?
ALFRED	Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.

BARBARA	I'm on break from-
BRUCE	Oxbridge Academy?
BARBARA	Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
BRUCE	I recognized the accent.

BRUCE	Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
BARBARA	Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
BRUCE	You are going back to school.

DICK	Please be looking for me.
BARBARA	I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-

DICK	Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
BARBARA	My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.

BARBARA	I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
DICK	Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.

BARBARA	This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
DICK	Keep it.
BARBARA	Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
DICK	Hey, what's your problem?
BARBARA	I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.

BARBARA	I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
DICK	You'd be surprised.
BARBARA	Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
DICK	Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.

BARBARA	Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
DICK	What are you talking about?
BARBARA	Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
DICK	Alfred and Bruce are like family.
BARBARA	Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
DICK	Alfred's happy here.
BARBARA	Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.

BATGIRL	Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
ROBIN	Divide and conquer.

ROBIN	Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
BATGIRL	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.

BATGIRL	This is easy.
ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
BATGIRL	Why?

ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number two.
BATGIRL	I'm afraid to ask.
ROBIN	Be ready for anything.

BATGIRL	Pow!  What!  Kazow!
ROBIN	What exactly are you doing?
BATGIRL	I don't know.  It just feels right.

BATGIRL	It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
ROBIN	Damn?  Damn is not good.
BATGIRL	Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.

BATMAN	You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
FREEZE	I hate being lectured.

FREEZE	After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
BATMAN	Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.

FREEZE	Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
BATMAN	We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.

BATMAN	You're loosing your cool
FREEZE	I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.

FREEZE	Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
BATMAN	I didn't kill your wife.

BATMAN	Nice suit.  And today you are?
ROBIN	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
BATMAN	This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
ROBIN	It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.

ROBIN	... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
BATMAN	Mr. Freeze.
ROBIN	The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
BATMAN	The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
ROBIN	Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
BATMAN	No, Robin.  He's going to jail.

ROBIN	I was just hanging around.
BATMAN	I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
ROBIN	How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.

BATMAN	Watch the first step.
ROBIN	Surf's up.

ROBIN	You think Freeze will take the bait?
BATMAN	He'll be here.

BATMAN	You don't have two million.  Three million - -
ROBIN	I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -

BATMAN	Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
ROBIN	I can make it.

ROBIN	She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
BATMAN	I know.  The feeling just vanished.
ROBIN	I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
BATMAN	Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
ROBIN	I'm totally over her.  Positively.
BATMAN	Me too.  Great stems, though.
ROBIN	Umm-hmmmm.
BATMAN	Definitely.

ROBIN	How did you...?
BATMAN	Open Sesame...Chicken.

BATMAN	She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
ROBIN	Can he save her?
BATMAN	No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-

BATMAN	No beauty...
ROBIN	Just the beast.

BATMAN	Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
ROBIN	What are you talking about?
BATMAN	Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
ROBIN	A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!

ROBIN	We gotta get those locks changed.
BATMAN	She knows who we are.
ROBIN	I guess we'll just have to kill her.
BATMAN	Kill her later.  We've got work to do.

BATMAN	No sign of the snowman.
ROBIN	Maybe he melted.

BATMAN	If we could relay the sunlight-
ROBIN	From the other side of the equator-

ROBIN	Winded, old timer?
BATMAN	Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.

BRUCE	They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
PAMELA	Dr. Pamela Isley.
BRUCE	What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
PAMELA	Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
BRUCE	We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
PAMELA	I see you knew him.
BRUCE	That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
PAMELA	I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.

PAMELA	Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
BRUCE	Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
PAMELA	Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
BRUCE	People come first, Dr. Isley.

PAMELA	Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
BRUCE	Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.

PAMELA	Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
BRUCE	I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
PAMELA	Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?

JULIE	No!?
BRUCE	Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
JULIE	But soon...

JULIE	And?
BRUCE	Can I get some help over here?

JULIE	You're not even listening to me.
BRUCE	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
JULIE	We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.

BRUCE	Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
JULIE	I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
BRUCE	Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
JULIE	But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
BRUCE	I wouldn't bet on that.
JULIE	I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.

JULIE	Who's Ivy?
BRUCE	What?
JULIE	You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
BRUCE	I wish I knew.

BRUCE	Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
JULIE	Bruce?  What are you doing?

JULIE	Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
BRUCE	Well...um...her.
JULIE	You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.

DICK	That's gotta hurt.
BRUCE	Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.

DICK	What happened to his wife?
BRUCE	Presumed dead.  No one knows.

BRUCE	He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
DICK	Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?

BRUCE	I need the Wayne Diamonds.
DICK	We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
BRUCE	Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
DICK	Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
BRUCE	Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
DICK	I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?

DICK	I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
BRUCE	You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.

BRUCE	Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
DICK	Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?

BRUCE	He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
DICK	But he's never said a word-
BRUCE	You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
DICK	Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
BRUCE	I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.

DICK	McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
BRUCE	Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
DICK	I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
BRUCE	I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
DICK	Like hell you do.
BRUCE	Dick, don't push me right now.
DICK	Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
BRUCE	Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
DICK	Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
BRUCE	She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
DICK	Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.

DICK	That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
BRUCE	Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
DICK	And she did it all for me.  For love.
BRUCE	She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
DICK	Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
BRUCE	She wants to kill you.
DICK	You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
BRUCE	You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?

DICK	One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
BRUCE	I knew you could handle it.

FREEZE	Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
IVY	Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
FREEZE	I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.

FREEZE	Impressive
IVY	Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
FREEZE	An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
IVY	Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.

IVY	I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
FREEZE	I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.

FREEZE	No gun.  How disarming.
IVY	I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
FREEZE	Dear daisy, don't despair.

FREEZE	My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
IVY	You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.

FREEZE	In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
IVY	You leave Batman and Robin to me.

IVY	Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
FREEZE	Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
IVY	Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-

FREEZE	You will rescue my wife
IVY	OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?

IVY	Make yourself right at home.
FREEZE	Where is my wife?
IVY	There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
FREEZE	You lie!

FREEZE	Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
IVY	Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?

FREEZE	Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
IVY	Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.

IVY	I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
FREEZE	Adam and Evil.

FREEZE	You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
IVY	Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
FREEZE	That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
IVY	As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
FREEZE	One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
IVY	The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
FREEZE	Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
IVY	I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.

FREEZE	Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
IVY	Not good.

MS. B. HAVEN	Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
FREEZE	I find that unlikely.
MS. B. HAVEN	Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
FREEZE	To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
MS. B. HAVEN	What say we turn up the heat?
FREEZE	You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
MS. B. HAVEN	Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
FREEZE	Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.

ROBIN	Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
IVY	At you?  Polly want a kiss?

IVY	I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
ROBIN	I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
IVY	How about dangerous curves?
ROBIN	Of trust. Tell me your plan.
IVY	Kiss me and I'll tell you.
ROBIN	Tell me and I'll kiss you.
IVY	Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
ROBIN	I've got to stop him.
IVY	One kiss, my love.  For luck.

IVY	Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
ROBIN	What do you mean?
IVY	You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
ROBIN	Then you never loved me?
IVY	Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.

IVY	You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
ROBIN	Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.

WOODRUE	What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
PAMELA	What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?

PAMELA	You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
WOODRUE	You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.

WOODRUE	...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
PAMELA	Our work?
WOODRUE	Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...

PAMELA	Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
WOODRUE	Well, I can respect your opinion.

WOODRUE	Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
PAMELA	Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.

BLADE	What?
NYSSA	They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

BLADE	Why?
NYSSA	Survival.

BLADE	Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
NYSSA	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.

NYSSA	Two years.
BLADE	Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
NYSSA	No.  They've been training to hunt you.

BLADE	You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
NYSSA	What the hell are you doing, Blade?
BLADE	We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.

BLADE	Where to first?
NYSSA	The House of Pain.

NYSSA	This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
BLADE	I haven't forgotten.

BLADE	What is it with you people and pain?
NYSSA	We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.

NYSSA	What was that?
BLADE	Nothing.

NYSSA	You're hurt.
BLADE	I'll heal.
NYSSA	What about Nomak?
BLADE	He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
NYSSA	I didn't know.

BLADE	how long since he was bitten?
NYSSA	Minutes.

BLADE	Recognize him?
NYSSA	From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
BLADE	Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
NYSSA	Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
BLADE	Time.

BLADE	No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
NYSSA	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
BLADE	Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.

NYSSA	I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
BLADE	Like cancer with a purpose.
NYSSA	Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --

NYSSA	He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
BLADE	You don't have to hunt to do it.
NYSSA	Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?

NYSSA	Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
BLADE	Fry 'em.

NYSSA	Blade.
BLADE	Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

NYSSA	Each day is a little life.
BLADE	What?
NYSSA	Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.

NYSSA	Anyone else make it?
BLADE	I don't think so.

NYSSA	Thank you.
BLADE	For what?
NYSSA	It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
BLADE	I wouldn't read too much into it.

BLADE	You don't want to go there.
NYSSA	Why?
BLADE	Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
NYSSA	It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
BLADE	Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
NYSSA	If that's true, then why'd you save me?

NYSSA	Why do you hate us so much?
BLADE	I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
NYSSA	Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?

NYSSA	You're hurting me.
BLADE	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?

BLADE	It means "bloodbrother."
NYSSA	I don't understand.

NYSSA	How does it look?
BLADE	Not good.

BLADE	What do you want me to do?
NYSSA	I want to see the sun rise.

BLADE	How do you feel?
WHISTLER	Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.

WHISTLER	You came back for me.
BLADE	Did you think I wouldn't?
WHISTLER	Took you long enough.

BLADE	Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
WHISTLER	You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.

BLADE	I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
WHISTLER	Either that or feeding the worms.

BLADE	What do you think?
WHISTLER	Sounds like a plan.
BLADE	What do you really think?
WHISTLER	These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.

BLADE	He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
WHISTLER	I don't like it.
BLADE	I'm not giving you a choice, old man.

BLADE	I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
WHISTLER	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

BLADE	Where were you, Whistler?
WHISTLER	I'll show you.

WHISTLER	You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
BLADE	I wouldn't worry about it.

WHISTLER	I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
BLADE	Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
WHISTLER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
BLADE	It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?

WHISTLER	Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
BLADE	We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.

WHISTLER	Your security's for shit, kid.
BLADE	Where the hell have you been?
WHISTLER	Just out connecting a few dots.

BLADE	What's your problem, Whistler?
WHISTLER	Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

WHISTLER	I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
BLADE	Then who does he work for?

WHISTLER	Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
BLADE	Blood...

REINHARDT	And so will we.
BLADE	Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
REINHARDT	Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
BLADE	You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.

BLADE	Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
REINHARDT	So?
BLADE	So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.

REINHARDT	Put it back in park, Blade.
BLADE	Thought you were dead.
REINHARDT	Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.

DAMASKINOS	It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
BLADE	For what?

BLADE	You want me to hunt them for you.
DAMASKINOS	Not alone.

BLADE	The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
DAMASKINOS	I should think that would be obvious at this point.

DAMASKINOS	True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
BLADE	Too bad you're out of it.

DAMASKINOS	And why is that?
BLADE	Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.

SCUD	You got something in mind, Blade?
BLADE	Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.

BLADE	Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
SCUD	I don't know about this, man --

SCUD	Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
BLADE	Human?

SCUD	So you're going to do this?
BLADE	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?

SCUD	What's going on?
BLADE	He was here.  Watching us.
SCUD	Nomak?
BLADE	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

BLADE	Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
SCUD	You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.

SCUD	So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
BLADE	Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.

CHUPA	Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
WHISTLER	Getting your attention, Paco.
CHUPA	Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?

CHUPA	Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
WHISTLER	You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.

CHUPA	Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
WHISTLER	Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.

CHUPA	We want to attract them, not scare them off.
WHISTLER	Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?

WHISTLER	What the fuck you doing?
CHUPA	Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.

NYSSA	His name is Jared Nomak.
DAMASKINOS	Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.

DAMASKINOS	I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
NYSSA	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
DAMASKINOS	From his father, of course.
NYSSA	You experimented on your own, son?

NYSSA	We're locked in.
DAMASKINOS	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
NYSSA	Maybe it's better that way.

DAMASKINOS	Yes?
STEVENS	They've made contact with the Reapers.
DAMASKINOS	Any casualties?
STEVENS	Two so far.

DAMASKINOS	An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
STEVENS	No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
DAMASKINOS	Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.

DAMASKINOS	You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
STEVENS	As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?

NURSE	I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
NOMAK	Not that I'm in contact with.
NURSE	Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
NOMAK	No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
NURSE	It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.

NURSE	Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
NOMAK	Us?  What are you talking about?

WHISTLER	Tell me something, Skid --
SCUD	Scud.
WHISTLER	Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
SCUD	The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
WHISTLER	Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
SCUD	Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
WHISTLER	And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.

WHISTLER	Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
SCUD	Look, what's your problem?

SCUD	Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
WHISTLER	Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.

SCUD	This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
WHISTLER	Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?

WHISTLER	The hell are you fiddling with there?
SCUD	Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
WHISTLER	You're wasting your time, already been tried.
SCUD	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
WHISTLER	Nope.  Back then we did not.
SCUD	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
WHISTLER	Going on twenty years now.
SCUD	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
WHISTLER	Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?

WHISTLER	Pretty.
SCUD	I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"

WHISTLER	What about you?  You're not coming?
SCUD	After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.

SCUD	Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
WHISTLER	You little shit.  When did they get to you?
SCUD	Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?

BLADE	Whistler!
WHISTLER	Are we bringing home strays now?

BLADE	She's been bitten.
WHISTLER	You should've killed her, then.
BLADE	She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.

WHISTLER	I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
BLADE	Just do it, old man.

BLADE	Stupidity.
WHISTLER	Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
BLADE	It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.

BLADE	Get in. Youre leaving.
WHISTLER	Wait.

WHISTLER	What took you so long?
BLADE	Don't even start, old man.

WHISTLER	Going somewhere?
BLADE	China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?

BLADE	Don't try to talk --
WHISTLER	Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
BLADE	No, we can treat the wounds --

BLADE	Whistler, I --
WHISTLER	I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.

FROST	Beautiful day, isn't it?
BLADE	How can you be out here?
FROST	I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.

FROST	It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
BLADE	I don't buy it.
FROST	Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
BLADE	Maybe I don't see it that way.
FROST	Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
BLADE	You're wrong.
FROST	Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.

FROST	The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
BLADE	Pass.
FROST	You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.

BLADE	You're not going anywhere.
FROST	Watch me.

FROST	No longer.
BLADE	Frost!!!

BLADE	Who dies first?
FROST	Take him.

BLADE	Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
FROST	You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
BLADE	You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

FROST	You're too human, Blade.
BLADE	It's because I'm human that I can do this.

MIRACIA	Is something wrong, my friend?
BLADE	You're blind --
MIRACIA	There are other ways to see. Sit.

MIRACIA	Hold out your hands.
BLADE	I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
MIRACIA	Show me.

MIRACIA	This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
BLADE	Who is LaMagra?
MIRACIA	The vampire God. This speaks of His return.

MIRACIA	The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
BLADE	The Blood Tide.
MIRACIA	Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
BLADE	How do I stop it?

MIRACIA	I am tired. Dawn is coming.
BLADE	But I just got here --
MIRACIA	You've been here longer than you think.

BLADE	You shouldn't be here.
KAREN	I'm sorry, I --

BLADE	-- he's a vampire.
KAREN	You're joking --

KAREN	Why?
BLADE	Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
KAREN	What happens then?

KAREN	And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
BLADE	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
KAREN	I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
BLADE	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.

KAREN	I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
BLADE	Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
KAREN	That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.

KAREN	How did you know?
BLADE	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
KAREN	You used me as bait?!
BLADE	It worked, didn't it?
KAREN	But, he could've --
BLADE	He didn't. Get over it.

KAREN	But he's a policeman --
BLADE	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?

BLADE	That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
KAREN	Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
BLADE	Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
KAREN	And that's a good thing?
BLADE	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.

KAREN	What are you doing?!
BLADE	Preventive medicine.

KAREN	You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
BLADE	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!

KAREN	Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
BLADE	There is no cure.
KAREN	You don't know that.

KAREN	What are you looking at?
BLADE	What do you see here?
KAREN	Graffiti --
BLADE	Look closer.

KAREN	I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
BLADE	Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?

KAREN	You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
BLADE	He will.

BLADE	Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
KAREN	How can you tell?
BLADE	The way they move, they way they smell --

KAREN	So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
BLADE	There are worse things than vampires out there.
KAREN	Like what?
BLADE	Like me.

KAREN	What is this place?
BLADE	Some kind of archive --
KAREN	Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
BLADE	You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.

KAREN	You're hurt --
BLADE	Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

KAREN	What am I injecting you with?
BLADE	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.

KAREN	It's dark in here.
BLADE	You get used to the darkness.

BLADE	I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
KAREN	Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
BLADE	I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
KAREN	If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.

BLADE	Just get out of here.
KAREN	Blade --

KAREN	I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
BLADE	For your miracle cure?

KAREN	Is he sick?
BLADE	Cancer.

KAREN	You care about him, don't you?
BLADE	We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.

KAREN	My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
BLADE	Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.

BLADE	Any progress?
KAREN	Some. It's been slow --
BLADE	You don't look so good.
KAREN	I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.

BLADE	For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
KAREN	You make it sound like I'm already dead.

KAREN	Are you all right?
BLADE	I've been better --
BLADE	How long have we been driving?
KAREN	I don't know. I woke up just before you did --

KAREN	Is it bad?
BLADE	We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

KAREN	It won't work on you.
BLADE	What are you talking about?

BLADE	Get out of here --
KAREN	I'm not leaving without you.
BLADE	You don't understand. The Thirst --

BLADE	-- tearing me -- apart.
KAREN	I know. Take some of my blood.
BLADE	No --
KAREN	It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.

BLADE	I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
KAREN	Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.

KAREN	I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
BLADE	For them. But for me --

BLADE	How's it going, Kam?
KAM	You're a week early.
BLADE	I was in the neighborhood.

BLADE	Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
KAM	I was afraid that might happen.
BLADE	Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
KAM	There's only one alternative to the serum.

BLADE	But you -- died --
VANESSA	Deacon brought me back.
BLADE	Fight him --

BLADE	Please --
VANESSA	Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.

BLADE	How could you be a part of this?
VANESSA	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
BLADE	You don't have to be.
VANESSA	You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.

VANESSA	I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
BLADE	I don't believe that.
VANESSA	You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.

KAREN	This isn't human blood.
CURTIS	Then what is it?
KAREN	I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --

KAREN	The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
CURTIS	What about the chemistry panel?

KAREN	Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
CURTIS	It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
KAREN	I thought you promised to give me some distance?
CURTIS	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.

KAREN	Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
CURTIS	No problem.

KAREN	You haven't started in on the internal organs?
CURTIS	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.

CURTIS	That's weird --
KAREN	What?
CURTIS	He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --

CURTIS	Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
KAREN	Sometimes --

KAREN	-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
CURTIS	Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --

DRAGONETTI	Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
FROST	You're wrong, Dragonetti.

FROST	The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
DRAGONETTI	Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
FROST	Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?

DRAGONETTI	I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
FROST	Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
DRAGONETTI	He is an abomination!

DRAGONETTI	The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
FROST	Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?

DRAGONETTI	These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
FROST	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
DRAGONETTI	You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
FROST	Perhaps.

FROST	How do you like that? Right on time.
DRAGONETTI	The other elders will never let you get away with this!

KAREN	How many of you are there?
FROST	A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
KAREN	What happens then?
FROST	The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
KAREN	LaMagra --
FROST	That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.

FROST	LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
KAREN	You.
FROST	Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?

KAREN	There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
FROST	What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
KAREN	But you use blood banks --
FROST	Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.

KAREN	You're a monster.
FROST	Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.

KAREN	Blade --
FROST	You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.

FROST	I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
KAREN	Get away from him!

KAREN	What -- ?
WHISTLER	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --

KAREN	Who are you people?
WHISTLER	My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --

KAREN	So what do you use, then? A stake?
WHISTLER	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --

WHISTLER	Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
KAREN	So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
WHISTLER	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.

WHISTLER	We keep in radio contact.
KAREN	You've been listening in the whole time?
WHISTLER	You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.

KAREN	Whistler!
WHISTLER	Go on, I'll be fine!

KAREN	Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
WHISTLER	We weren't sure we could trust you.

WHISTLER	Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
KAREN	What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
WHISTLER	The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
KAREN	No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
WHISTLER	Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.

KAREN	Why do you hunt them?
WHISTLER	Habit, mostly, just like this.

WHISTLER	I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
KAREN	He killed them?
WHISTLER	Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --

KAREN	How did you escape?
WHISTLER	I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.

KAREN	And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
WHISTLER	Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?

WHISTLER	I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
KAREN	I'll take my chances.

KAREN	All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
WHISTLER	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
KAREN	Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?

KAREN	Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
WHISTLER	How?
KAREN	With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.

KAREN	On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
WHISTLER	Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.

KAREN	What happened to the power?
WHISTLER	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.

THEO	Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
2ND DRIVER	Where do you think you're going?
THEO	Any place.
2ND DRIVER	This is one way.
THEO	I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
2ND DRIVER	I don't see anybody in there but you.
THEO	I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.

CAITLIN	Was someone in an accident?
LENORE	Do I hear a woman's voice?

CAITLIN	I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
LENORE	Don't you have children?
CAITLIN	Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.

CAITLIN	What are you doing on Theo's line?
LENORE	Taking messages.
CAITLIN	He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
LENORE	I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
CAITLIN	I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
LENORE	I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.

CAITLIN	Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
KLINGER	That's all we need.  Better let me drive.

KLINGER	Have you got to tell her your life story?
CAITLIN	This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
KLINGER	Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.

CAITLIN	What if they do question the authenticity?
KLINGER	Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
CAITLIN	I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
KLINGER	Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.

CAITLIN	Who's on the phone?
THEO	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.

CAITLIN	What was that for?
THEO	You could've made me lose my call.
CAITLIN	So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
THEO	I didn't hurt you.
CAITLIN	You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.

THEO	Say something ...
CAITLIN	Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
THEO	I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
CAITLIN	He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
THEO	How was I in the wrong?

THEO	I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
CAITLIN	I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
THEO	She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
CAITLIN	Theo wants to talk again.
THEO	Did you have to tell her my name?

CAITLIN	Will you two cut it out?
THEO	This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?

CAITLIN	He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
THEO	Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.

CAITLIN	I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
THEO	Then whose is it?
CAITLIN	You gotta just look the other way.
THEO	I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.

COP'S VOICE	Are you guys all right?
NELSON	You could've killed us.
COP'S VOICE	It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
NELSON	No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
COP'S VOICE	We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
NELSON	I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!

GRILLO	Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
THEO	I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
GRILLO	They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.

THEO	What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
GRILLO	Why would I do that?

GRILLO	Let's have your license, mister.
THEO	I'm going to level with you officer.

GRILLO	What's this?
THEO	See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.

GRILLO	Lady, don't let him do it!
THEO	You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
GRILLO	You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!

THEO	Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
GRILLO	Yes sir.

GRILLO	In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
THEO	Or relieve me of it later.
GRILLO	Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.

THEO	You missed.
GRILLO	Any time you decide to let me in on it.

GRILLO	How do we get back to the freeway?
THEO	Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.

THEO	Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
GRILLO	Can you make him stop!
THEO	Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?

GRILLO	Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
THEO	I'm the one they'd be looking for.

GRILLO	I told you I should've cuffed him.
THEO	I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!

LENORE	He's seen both of us now.
GRILLO	Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
LENORE	What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.

GRILLO	It took you long enough to get my ass out.
LENORE	With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
GRILLO	You can tell she was really worried about me.

LENORE	I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
GRILLO	So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!

GRILLO	Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
LENORE	Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
GRILLO	You never miss a trick.
LENORE	I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.

KLINGER	You switched license plates?
THEO	It's taken care of.
KLINGER	We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
THEO	Not this minute.

KLINGER	That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
THEO	Bullshit.
KLINGER	That's your "rep."
THEO	Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.

KLINGER	What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
THEO	Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.

KLINGER	Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
THEO	That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.

THEO	I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
KLINGER	Just like they say; no fucking self control.
THEO	If you know that just back off.
KLINGER	Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
THEO	And stop with the directions.
KLINGER	Make a "U" and go back.
THEO	That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
KLINGER	<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.

KLINGER	We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
THEO	Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
KLINGER	First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
THEO	I improved on the fucking original.
KLINGER	Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
THEO	It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.

KLINGER	Got your badge?
THEO	Satisfied, Wiseass?
KLINGER	In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
THEO	What do you keep making me out to be?

THEO	Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
KLINGER	Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!

NELSON	I thought you said you could handle him.
LENORE	I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.

LENORE	Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
NELSON	What am I supposed to do?

LENORE	Lose the hardware now.
NELSON	We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.

NELSON	Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
LENORE	Allow me.

LENORE	He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
NELSON	There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.

LENORE	Nels?
NELSON	I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
LENORE	Any minute.
NELSON	I was worried about you.  Both of you.
LENORE	We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
NELSON	Give me 20 minutes at least.

THEO	Do I know you?
LENORE	I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
THEO	If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
LENORE	You don't understand.
THEO	No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
LENORE	Will you let me explain!
THEO	And what're you whispering for?
LENORE	I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.

THEO	Lady, try making some sense.
LENORE	You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
THEO	What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
LENORE	They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
THEO	Who smashed the phone?
LENORE	They're holding my husband downstairs.
THEO	Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
LENORE	They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
THEO	Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
LENORE	I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
THEO	You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
LENORE	I don't believe you.
THEO	You're the one who's not to be believed.
LENORE	My name is --
THEO	I don't want to know --
LENORE	My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
THEO	Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
LENORE	I realize you don't want to be involved.
THEO	I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
LENORE	You won't disconnect.
THEO	Oh won't I?
LENORE	Because you know you'll be killing us.
THEO	Don't lay this on me!
LENORE	Then hang up!  Do it!

THEO	Why would anybody want to hurt you?
LENORE	They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
THEO	Where'd they take you to?
LENORE	I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
THEO	Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
LENORE	No -- nothing.

THEO	Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
LENORE	No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
THEO	The cops could trace this call back to you.
LENORE	One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
THEO	What makes you say that?
LENORE	He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
THEO	Who?
LENORE	Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
THEO	Oh man.  These people mean business.
LENORE	Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
THEO	Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.

LENORE	No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
THEO	I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
LENORE	Please.
THEO	Shit!

THEO	Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
LENORE	I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
THEO	I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 

THEO	I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
LENORE	They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
THEO	Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.

THEO	I'm with two friends now.
LENORE	Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
THEO	Stop throwing names at me.
LENORE	Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
THEO	What do they need her for?
LENORE	They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
THEO	Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.

LENORE	The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
THEO	Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
LENORE	They don't know you.  They won't listen.

LENORE	He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
THEO	He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!

LENORE	Theo?
THEO	Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
LENORE	26th off Wilshire.
THEO	Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
LENORE	She would if she heard my voice on the phone.

LENORE	Why isn't anyone answering me?
THEO	Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.

LENORE	Will you please speak to me! Theo?
THEO	Another minute.

THEO	Hello?  It's just me and you again.
LENORE	What about the others?
THEO	I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
LENORE	What are you doing now?
THEO	What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
LENORE	Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
THEO	Tell me what she looks like.
LENORE	They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
THEO	I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.

THEO	Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
LENORE	How much time do you have left on it?
THEO	I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
LENORE	Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
THEO	I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
LENORE	A woman?
THEO	Hey drop it, okay?
LENORE	I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
THEO	It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
LENORE	And that was the end of it?
THEO	I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
LENORE	I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
THEO	Well you did.

LENORE	What do you do for a living?
THEO	Sometimes I paint.
LENORE	Our house always needs touching up.
THEO	Pictures.
LENORE	I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
THEO	They say my work is somewhat derivative.

LENORE	I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
THEO	Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
LENORE	I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
THEO	Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
LENORE	I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
THEO	A price on everything.
LENORE	I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
THEO	I'm about ten blocks from the school.
LENORE	I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
THEO	That makes two of us.
LENORE	You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?

THEO	There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
LENORE	I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.

LENORE	Make a right.  You can't miss it.
THEO	I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.

THEO	Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
LENORE	I can hear you again, clearly.
THEO	Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.

THEO	Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
LENORE	That's not her.

THEO	Does she wear glasses?
LENORE	No.
THEO	I've got to ask somebody.

LENORE	What's happening?
THEO	She's gone --
LENORE	Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
THEO	I'm trying to.

THEO	He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
LENORE	It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
THEO	I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
LENORE	When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.

THEO	You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
LENORE	The one in Brentwood.
THEO	What bank?
LENORE	The City National on San Vincente.

THEO	Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
LENORE	What do you mean?
THEO	Black Mercedes, 600S.

THEO	I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
LENORE	I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
THEO	Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
LENORE	Even if you found us -- what then?
THEO	I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
LENORE	Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
THEO	Not a chance.
LENORE	Don't say that.
THEO	Do you know what's in that box?
LENORE	I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.

THEO	They'll recognize it's not your husband.
LENORE	Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
THEO	They've still got to be able to sign his name.
LENORE	It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
THEO	I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
LENORE	Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
THEO	You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
LENORE	To hide it from the I.R.S.
THEO	How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
LENORE	Don't talk.  Don't talk!
THEO	What's going on?
LENORE	The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
THEO	I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
LENORE	If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
THEO	It won't be him.
LENORE	Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
THEO	Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
LENORE	But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
THEO	I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
LENORE	Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
THEO	Why tell me this?
LENORE	Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
THEO	You can't give up.
LENORE	When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?

THEO	Did you jiggle the phone?
LENORE	No.
THEO	Did you hear that click?
LENORE	Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
THEO	Or somebody else there is listening in --
LENORE	Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
THEO	Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.

LENORE	No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
THEO	Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.

LENORE	Yes?  Yes?
THEO	Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
LENORE	They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
THEO	Lucky for them they didn't.
LENORE	What did you do?
THEO	I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
LENORE	God, if he doesn't come back --
THEO	I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
LENORE	They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --

LENORE	Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
THEO	Are you okay?
LENORE	They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
THEO	That's coming off.  How about the girl?
LENORE	She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
THEO	Your husband?
LENORE	He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
THEO	You're all three of you in that van?
LENORE	Yes.
THEO	Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
LENORE	Yes sir.
THEO	Put the man back on.

THEO	Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
LENORE	I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
THEO	She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
LENORE	I can't do it.
THEO	Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
LENORE	Yes.
THEO	Can you walk?
LENORE	Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
THEO	They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
LENORE	Why can't it be her?
THEO	She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
LENORE	All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
THEO	Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
LENORE	I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.

LENORE	Rachel -- Oh my God.
THEO	Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.

LENORE	It's locked.
THEO	Shit.  I'm sorry.

LENORE	Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
THEO	She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
LENORE	She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
THEO	Include me in that.

THEO	Now I have -- it's a long story.
LENORE	Why didn't you just shoot them?
THEO	Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
LENORE	You're going to let them get away with this?
THEO	We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
LENORE	They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
THEO	So far they're keeping their part of it.
LENORE	They put their hands all over me.
THEO	Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?

THEO	For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
LENORE	Hand me the phone.

LENORE	He had a gun.  I have it now.
THEO	Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
LENORE	The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?

THEO	You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
LENORE	There isn't any such person.
THEO	Whose money is this?
LENORE	It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
THEO	The guy with the transplant.
LENORE	Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
THEO	Damned if I know.
LENORE	The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
THEO	At least one.
LENORE	Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
THEO	You timed that beautifully.
LENORE	They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
THEO	I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
LENORE	As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
THEO	And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
LENORE	I thought it was inspired.
THEO	There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!

LENORE	Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
THEO	Why pick me to be your "mark?"
LENORE	Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
THEO	You knew about me.

LENORE	Who's in back?
THEO	L.A.P.D.
LENORE	Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.

THEO	Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
LENORE	There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
THEO	Assure them that you're being well treated.

THEO	Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
LENORE	He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
THEO	Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
LENORE	You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
THEO	We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
LENORE	Do you have to point that?
THEO	Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
LENORE	He seems to be headed for Topanga.
THEO	I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
LENORE	The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
THEO	Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
LENORE	I don't hear him moving around anymore.
THEO	Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
LENORE	A typical fuck-up.
THEO	What's that supposed to me?
LENORE	I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
THEO	You, I would've noticed.
LENORE	Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
THEO	You were at the Emerald that night?
LENORE	Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
THEO	I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
LENORE	I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
THEO	You're enjoying this too much.

THEO	Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
LENORE	You could've hit me.
THEO	Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
LENORE	You wouldn't --
THEO	Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
LENORE	Stop talking like that!
THEO	Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!

LENORE	I'm still okay.
THEO	Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
LENORE	He wants 75 back.
THEO	Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
LENORE	Did you hear that?
THEO	Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.

THEO	It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
LENORE	No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
THEO	What's Nels' number?
LENORE	259-7881.
THEO	Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.

LENORE	Do you think they'll walk away?
THEO	Ask them.

LENORE	They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
THEO	That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
LENORE	Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.

THEO	What's happening?
LENORE	I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
THEO	Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
LENORE	The money, Nels ... ?

LENORE	Any idea where you're going?
THEO	I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
LENORE	They did some great job of reforming you.
THEO	That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
LENORE	Think you could do a picture of me?
THEO	I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.

THEO	Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
LENORE	Why are we stopping?
THEO	I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.

THEO	Who'd ever think, to look at you?
LENORE	As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
THEO	You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
LENORE	We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.

THEO	Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
LENORE	Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
THEO	How about "later?"

THEO	What's really on your wicked little mind?
LENORE	The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
THEO	That's a reasonable possibility.
LENORE	He might've heard everything we said in the car.
THEO	What's your point?
LENORE	We can't leave him to repeat anything.
THEO	Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
LENORE	You're the man with the gun.
THEO	Naturally.
LENORE	Naturally.
THEO	Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
LENORE	Only one way to find out.

THEO	I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
LENORE	That's not good enough.
THEO	That's how it's going to be.

THEO	I'm handling it.
LENORE	He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --

LENORE	Both hands on your lap.
THEO	Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.

THEO	Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
LENORE	That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.

THEO	Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
LENORE	Took preparation.
THEO	Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
LENORE	Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.

THEO	Know what else is in here?
LENORE	Take your hand out of there. Slowly.

THEO	Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
LENORE	You won't live to see it.
THEO	It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
LENORE	Pull over!  Pull over someplace.

LENORE	Five ... six.
THEO	Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.

LENORE	I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
THEO	Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
LENORE	-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.

LENORE	I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
THEO	I don't want it.
LENORE	My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
THEO	Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
LENORE	I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...

LENORE'S VOICE	Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
THEO	Who is this?
LENORE'S VOICE	You mustn't hang up.

LENORE'S VOICE	Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
THEO	Didn't we play this scene before?
LENORE'S VOICE	Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
THEO	I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.

MALE VOICE	Who are you working for?
THEO	I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
MALE VOICE	Twenty percent.
THEO	Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
MALE VOICE	Whatever you say.

THEO	You're making it too easy.
MALE VOICE	You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
THEO	They saw you kill the driver.
MALE VOICE	You're up on your details, aren't you?
THEO	You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
MALE VOICE	Keep talking.

THEO	You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
MALE VOICE	There are no guarantees in this life.
THEO	Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.

MALE VOICE	Where do we meet?
THEO	It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
MALE VOICE	Pass.
THEO	A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
MALE VOICE	What time frame have you got in mind?
THEO	It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
MALE VOICE	We can be there.

THEO	I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
MALE VOICE	Some loyalty.
THEO	There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
THEO	Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
MALE VOICE	She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
THEO	Got a phone in that van?
MALE VOICE	Sure.
THEO	Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
MALE VOICE	308-9962.
THEO	Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
MALE VOICE	You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
THEO	I wish it had never been invented.

THEO	I'm here.  Where are you?
MALE VOICE	We don't see you.
THEO	I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
MALE VOICE	Stay there.
THEO	I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
MALE VOICE	It's your call.
THEO	Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
MALE VOICE	Just relax.
THEO	I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
MALE VOICE	You'll see her.
THEO	I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
MALE VOICE	Talk to the man.

MALE VOICE	Satisfied?
THEO	You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
MALE VOICE	I don't know what you mean.
THEO	I still don't see you.
MALE VOICE	We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."

MALE VOICE	We're waiting on you.
THEO	Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
MALE VOICE	It's in the process.
THEO	I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
MALE VOICE	You should've done all this before.
THEO	I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
MALE VOICE	Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
THEO	My pleasure --
MALE VOICE	Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
THEO	Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
MALE VOICE	Negative.
THEO	You'll still have the girl and the husband.
MALE VOICE	And not a nickel.
THEO	Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
MALE VOICE	And then?
THEO	You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
MALE VOICE	And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
THEO	I won't let 'em.

MALE VOICE	I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
THEO	Are you trying to panic the women?
MALE VOICE	That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
THEO	I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?

THEO	Stop the crying.
MALE VOICE	She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
THEO	I'm backing up.

THEO	Count it.
MALE VOICE	Don't worry.
THEO	Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.

MALE VOICE	Seems like it.
THEO	Put the girl on.

MALE VOICE	Yeah.  Why don't we?
THEO	What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.

NELSON	What's he doing?  Answer me!
THEO	Better reassure him.

THEO	Who am I talking to?
NELSON	Call me "Nels."
THEO	Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
NELSON	If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
THEO	I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.

THEO	If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
NELSON	And if you ditch us we get zilch.
THEO	Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.

THEO	You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
NELSON	The fuck I will!
THEO	It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.

THEO	You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
NELSON	There's two police cars now.
THEO	Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
NELSON	You want us to get ourselves killed?
THEO	From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
NELSON	And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
THEO	Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?

THEO	Yeah?
NELSON	I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
THEO	You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.

NELSON	Yeah?
THEO	Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
NELSON	Who's this?
THEO	I thought you'd know me by now.
NELSON	What does it take to kill you?
THEO	I suppose you're in your taxi?
NELSON	Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
THEO	Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
NELSON	That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
THEO	My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!

NELSON	I can see the benefit in that.
THEO	You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
NELSON	Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
THEO	Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.

NELSON	In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
THEO	Take the 405 south.

THEO	How far off are you?
NELSON	Five minutes.
THEO	Where do I turn?
NELSON	Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
THEO	Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
NELSON	And make ourselves a hell of a target.
THEO	We're gonna get there first.
NELSON	How do you know?
THEO	Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.

THEO	Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
NELSON	I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
THEO	Where's the backpack?
NELSON	None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
THEO	At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.

THEO	Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
NELSON	In your dreams.
THEO	Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
NELSON	Are you busting my chops or what?

THEO	Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
NELSON	Stay put!  I know my way around.

THEO	Who were you talking to?
NELSON	Them.  They won't be expecting us.
THEO	Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
NELSON	Nobody can do anything right but you!

THEO	I'm in awe.
NELSON	Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.

THEO	Since when did you guys start changing tires?
OFFICER GRILLO	Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
THEO	Seems not.
OFFICER GRILLO	If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
THEO	Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
OFFICER GRILLO	Mind if I have a look?

THEO	Why are you picking on me for?
OFFICER GRILLO	Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
THEO	Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.

THEO	Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
VOICE	Who are you?
THEO	Let me talk to the lady again.
VOICE	There's no lady here.
THEO	If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
VOICE	Hold on.
THEO	If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
VOICE	Let her tell you.

TRUCKER	I already called for an ambulance.
THEO	You've got a <u>phone</u>?
TRUCKER	Doesn't everybody?

THEO	Can I make a quick call?
TRUCKER	Government business?
THEO	Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.

TRUCKER	What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
THEO	Undercover.
TRUCKER	I thought so.
THEO	Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.

TRUCKER	The 405 is coming up.
THEO	Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?

THEO	Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
TRUCKER	Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!

TRUCKER	You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
THEO	From here on, I dish it out.

BRETT	Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
EVAN	How yo doin', Gabe!

BRETT	Work!  Don't say that word, man.
EVAN	Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
BRETT	Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
EVAN	C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!

BRETT	Did you catch that thunder?
EVAN	No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.

EVAN	It's a perfect day for a monster jump.  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
BRETT	What?
EVAN	Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
BRETT	That woulda been cool.
EVAN	Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.

DELMAR	Answer the man.
HAL	Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.

HAL	C-4?
DELMAR	More bang for the buck.

DELMAR	Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
HAL	Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
DELMAR	Who's shooting?

DELMAR	Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
HAL	Fuck you.
DELMAR	Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.

JESSIE	Hal's signalling he's OK.
FRANK	They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.

JESSIE	He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
FRANK	I don't know.
JESSIE	If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
FRANK	Hal will have my head for this.

JESSIE	And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
FRANK	I admit, I can be bought.

FRANK	Jessie, Jessie, copy?
JESSIE	I copy.
FRANK	Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
JESSIE	If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
FRANK	Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.

FRANK	Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
JESSIE	Where's the radio?

HAL	Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
FRANK	So, what do you see?
HAL	Surprise me.
FRANK	What usually eats a banana?
HAL	A monkey?
FRANK	So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
HAL	Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?

QUALEN	That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
GABE	It can't fly in this weather.
QUALEN	This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.

QUALEN	You know how the airlines are.
GABE	Bags?
QUALEN	Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.

GABE	Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
QUALEN	A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.

QUALEN	Go on, fetch.
GABE	I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.

QUALEN	Tucker?
GABE	Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.

GABE	Jessie!  Are you alright?
QUALEN	I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
GABE	Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
QUALEN	Love's a killer, isn't it?

QUALEN	Where are you, Walker?
GABE	You're getting warmer!

QUALEN	Throw it up or I'll kill her.
GABE	You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
QUALEN	The money!
GABE	WHEN SHE'S SAFE!

HAL	Glad you could drop in.
GABE	Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
HAL	I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
GABE	Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
HAL	I love you, too.
GABE	Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
HAL	Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.

GABE	Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
HAL	Hey, fuck you.

GABE	I'm coming out!
HAL	No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
GABE	The clip's not gonna hold!

GABE	She's losing it!
HAL	Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!

HAL	What the hell are you doing here?!
GABE	I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
HAL	Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
GABE	When we get this group down, I'm gone.
HAL	You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
GABE	I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
HAL	Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
GABE	Look, I know--
HAL	You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
GABE	I did what I thought was right.
HAL	Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
GABE	There wasn't time for anything else.
HAL	We'll never know, will we?
GABE	Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
HAL	What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
GABE	And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!

HAL	No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
GABE	If you want, do it.  I don't care.

HAL	Forget me.  If you can, get away.
GABE	Would you?

HAL	Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
GABE	My pleasure.

GABE	How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
GABE	Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
HAL	Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--

HAL	What are we going to do?
GABE	Give him the money.

HAL	I'm going with you.
GABE	Not on that leg.
HAL	Take the gun.
GABE	You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.

GABE	Room service...Hi, Sarah.
SARAH	Hi, Gabe.

GABE	How're ya feeling?
SARAH	Fine, I guess...
GABE	Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...

GABE	She's tough.
SARAH	Is it really four thousand?

GABE	Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
SARAH	Okay--I don't know about this.

SARAH	Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
GABE	Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
SARAH	Can I count as fast as I like?
GABE	Sure you can.
SARAH	I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.

GABE	There you go.
SARAH	One...

SARAH	Two...
GABE	That's it, you look like a professional.
SARAH	Three...

SARAH	Four...five...
GABE	Nice and easy...
SARAH	Six...

SARAH	Please -- oh, no -- please!
GABE	I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!

GABE	Use your other hand!  Grab it!
SARAH	Help me!  I don't want to die!
GABE	You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!

GABE	Do you see them yet?
JESSIE	Patience my love, patience.
GABE	That's a virtue isn't it?
JESSIE	Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?

JESSIE	Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
GABE	Just hangin' out.

JESSIE	Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
GABE	Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.

JESSIE	He knows it well.
GABE	The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
JESSIE	You can stop right there.
GABE	We spent a night there one night...
JESSIE	Enough.
GABE	Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
JESSIE	Oh, please.

GABE	And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
JESSIE	Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.

JESSIE	The winds are picking up.
GABE	On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?

JESSIE	Hello, Gabriel.
GABE	When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
JESSIE	Where've you been?
GABE	Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
JESSIE	Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
GABE	After the funeral I just had to leave.
JESSIE	Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
GABE	A lot of things fell apart up there.
JESSIE	I know...
GABE	I don't think you do.
JESSIE	Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
GABE	Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
JESSIE	I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
GABE	I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
JESSIE	Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
GABE	I don't expect you to understand.
JESSIE	I don't understand?
GABE	You couldn't.
JESSIE	You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
GABE	Why are you yelling?
JESSIE	Excuse me?
GABE	Why are you yelling?
JESSIE	Did I miss something?
GABE	Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
JESSIE	I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
GABE	Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
JESSIE	Resuscitation?
GABE	--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
JESSIE	Which could maybe what?
GABE	Maybe lead to a flare up...
JESSIE	A flare up...
GABE	Flare up of old emotions...
JESSIE	Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
GABE	From one professional to another, of course.
JESSIE	Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
GABE	No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.

JESSIE	Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
GABE	I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
JESSIE	Where?
GABE	It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
JESSIE	You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
GABE	Like I said, I can't turn it off.
JESSIE	And I can't leave.
GABE	If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
JESSIE	You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
GABE	Jess--you look good.

JESSIE	Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
GABE	Hal knows what he's doing.

JESSIE	If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
GABE	He doesn't want my help.
JESSIE	That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
GABE	He can handle it.
JESSIE	What if he can't?
GABE	I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
JESSIE	You mean the nerve.

JESSIE	I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
GABE	Can't do it.

JESSIE	Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
GABE	I only came back for you.

JESSIE	Gabe!?
GABE	What are you doing here!?
JESSIE	Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
GABE	How'd you get up here?
JESSIE	Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
GABE	You got to go back now!
JESSIE	Where's Hal, what's going on?

GABE	Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
JESSIE	I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
GABE	That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
JESSIE	For the same reason you did, to help.
GABE	Yeah, let's go.

GABE	Let's be creative.
JESSIE	Excuse me?

GABE	They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
JESSIE	You know me, I'm a night person.

GABE	Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
JESSIE	What about you?
GABE	Don't worry about me, just go.

GABE	Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
JESSIE	I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
GABE	I can't believe you just said that.
JESSIE	Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
GABE	Making things real rough for Hal.

JESSIE	You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
GABE	Call me sentimental.
JESSIE	Remember the first time we came up here?
GABE	Of course I do.
JESSIE	It was great.
GABE	You attacked me.
JESSIE	Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
GABE	Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
JESSIE	No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.

JESSIE	Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
GABE	I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.

JESSIE	Gabe...your arm?
GABE	Yeah?
JESSIE	If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
GABE	Sure, just give it back when you're done.

GABE	We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
JESSIE	I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
GABE	A simple yes or no would have done.
JESSIE	Want me to lead?
GABE	Cute.

GABE	Nice view, huh?
JESSIE	Breathtaking.

GABE	What was God thinking when he built this place?
JESSIE	If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.

JESSIE	Gabe!  Are you alright?
GABE	No, not really.  Throw down a rope.

JESSIE	Can you see light?
GABE	Up ahead.

JESSIE	Gabe are you alright?
GABE	For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.

JESSIE	No luck?
GABE	Next time, date only basketball players.

GABE	She's a lyin' bitch!!
JESSIE	Get it!

JESSIE	They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
GABE	We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!

JESSIE	We might be able to go that way.
GABE	Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.

GABE	Pull it apart!
JESSIE	What?
GABE	Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
JESSIE	This rope is sixty years old!
GABE	These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
JESSIE	Never
GABE	Never, what?!
JESSIE	I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
GABE	Helluva time for vanity!

JESSIE	Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
GABE	Jess, c'mon...

JESSIE	Gabe!
GABE	Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!

GABE	Reach up!  Do it!
JESSIE	Don't let me fall!
GABE	Do it, goddammit!

JESSIE	Thanks for holding on.
GABE	We were going together before I ever let go of you.
JESSIE	I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
GABE	I don't know.  I don't know.

GABE	Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
JESSIE	If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
GABE	There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
JESSIE	Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
GABE	Time is money -- please.

JESSIE	My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
GABE	That's exactly what I want you to do.
JESSIE	What about you?

GABE	What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
JESSIE	Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.

GABE	But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
JESSIE	Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
GABE	We don't have time to argue about it!
JESSIE	Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
GABE	Take the rope.
JESSIE	I won't do it.  No way.
GABE	Take the rope.
JESSIE	Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
GABE	Wrap it around that rock twice.
JESSIE	I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
GABE	An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
JESSIE	Forget it!  I refuse!
GABE	Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
JESSIE	Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.

GABE	Just kidding.
JESSIE	Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
GABE	Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!

JESSIE	What about you?!
GABE	RUN, DAMMIT!!

GABE	The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
JESSIE	There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
GABE	And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?

KYNETTE	Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
GABE	Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
KYNETTE	Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
GABE	I burned it.
KYNETTE	What the fuck you mean you burned it?
GABE	Never could save a thing.
KYNETTE	Now you get burned.

QUALEN	Where's the helicopter?
HAL	What the hell's going on?

QUALEN	The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
HAL	Right, all the bullets we can eat.

HAL	He'll freeze.
QUALEN	Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.

QUALEN	What's he doing?
HAL	The best he can since you gave him nothing.

QUALEN	Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
HAL	Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.

QUALEN	Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
HAL	The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.

QUALEN	Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
HAL	No, he's gone.
QUALEN	No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?

HAL	It's up there, on the Tower.
QUALEN	How far?

HAL	For Christ's sake, they're kids.
QUALEN	We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.

HAL	You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
QUALEN	Sue me.

HAL	Murdering, motherfucker...
QUALEN	Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.

QUALEN	You said there was a way across.
HAL	There is.

HAL	He never hurt anybody.
QUALEN	I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.

QUALEN	Travers, you're not running things.
HAL	When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.

QUALEN	Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
HAL	Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
QUALEN	No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
HAL	What are you talking about?

HAL	Yeah...
TRAVERS	Anyone else following?

TRAVERS	What's your names?
HAL	Tucker and Walker.
TRAVERS	Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.

TRAVERS	Have her come up.
HAL	The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.

HAL	On top of the peak.
TRAVERS	It looks like a winding route.

TRAVERS	He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
HAL	Half a day.

TRAVERS	Then where the fuck is!
HAL	There.  You blind?

HAL	Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
JESSIE	Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.

JESSIE	Go after her.
HAL	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.

JESSIE	Got to be Comb Bluff.
HAL	Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.

HAL	You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
JESSIE	Who's going with you?
HAL	You're looking at him.
JESSIE	Where's the rest of the team?
HAL	Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.

JESSIE	You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
HAL	<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.

JESSIE	Oh, my God!
HAL	Climb, Gabe, climb!

HAL	Right.
JESSIE	Then it's a deal.

MATHESON	I don't know about totally.
TRAVERS	Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
MATHESON	Do you always transport through the air?

TRAVERS	What the hell are you doing--
MATHESON	Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
TRAVERS	These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.

TRAVERS	Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
MATHESON	What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!

QUALEN	Travers!  Hurry it up.
TRAVERS	On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.

QUALEN	Why didn't you send the money over?
TRAVERS	Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.

QUALEN	What's the delay?
TRAVERS	Let's move your ass in there!!

TRAVERS	Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
QUALEN	Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
TRAVERS	Why?  What are you going to do?!
QUALEN	The monitor! I never ask twice.

TRAVERS	Don't use my name!
QUALEN	Ask the questions.
TRAVERS	You're both with the mountain rescue team?

QUALEN	Where's the third one, Travers?
TRAVERS	There, what's that place?

TRAVERS	Get off my back, Qualen!
QUALEN	I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.

TRAVERS	Don't give him anything.
QUALEN	We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.

TRAVERS	I don't trust him.
QUALEN	Kill him when he gets down.

QUALEN	Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
TRAVERS	We can't and he knows it.

QUALEN	Man against nature, right Travers.
TRAVERS	What about it?
QUALEN	Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?

TRAVERS	This way.
QUALEN	Then go fetch.

TRAVERS	He's alive!
QUALEN	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!

QUALEN	Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
TRAVERS	We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?

QUALEN	Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
TRAVERS	You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.

TRAVERS	This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
QUALEN	Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.

TRAVERS	Is it set?
QUALEN	Primed to go off right over his head, officer.

TRAVERS	Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
QUALEN	Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.

QUALEN	What's the code, Travers?
TRAVERS	I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
QUALEN	Give me the fucking code!

QUALEN	You got what we need?
TRAVERS	No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
QUALEN	No names, this is an open line!
TRAVERS	I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
QUALEN	Get off the radio!

WRIGHT	Rich...
TRAVERS	Good morning, Walt.
WRIGHT	I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
TRAVERS	Richard Travers.
WRIGHT	Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
TRAVERS	We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
WRIGHT	Appreciate it.
TRAVERS	You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?

WRIGHT	Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
TRAVERS	I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
WRIGHT	I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
TRAVERS	We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.

LIZA	What happened?
COP	Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.

COP	They said send you downstairs.
LIZA	Who?
COP	The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
LIZA	Any special reason?
COP	All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.

JERRY	The sound of love.
CYNIC	Excuse me?

JERRY	That's love.
CYNIC	Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
JERRY	I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.

JERRY	Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
CYNIC	Geronimo?
JERRY	Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
CYNIC	But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
JERRY	Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.

CYNIC	She must be some girl.
JERRY	I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.

JERRY	I never told her.
CYNIC	Why the hell not?
JERRY	I, uh, I have some problems.

CYNIC	Are you crazy?!
JERRY	The guy came right at us!
CYNIC	You turned up a one way street!

JERRY	I was only going one way.
CYNIC	Drop me off here!
JERRY	Look, I'm sorry --
CYNIC	Just drop me off.

FLIP	What're you thinking, Jerry?
JERRY	Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
FLIP	Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
JERRY	Mississippi?
FLIP	Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
JERRY	You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
FLIP	Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
JERRY	I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.

FLIP	<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
JERRY	Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.

FLIP	Saved you last night's, too.
JERRY	Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
FLIP	Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.

JERRY	Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
FLIP	Shut the hell up.

LIZA	I don't see the connection.
JERRY	Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
LIZA	Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
JERRY	Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.

LIZA	I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
JERRY	Do you still ride?
LIZA	Not for years.
JERRY	So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
LIZA	Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?

JERRY	The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
LIZA	Motive?
JERRY	He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
LIZA	<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
JERRY	Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.

JERRY	You going to warn him?
LIZA	I can't promise you anything.
JERRY	You think I'm crazy.
LIZA	I think you're different.
JERRY	You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
LIZA	No.

JERRY	I better get going.
LIZA	You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.

JERRY	What was your horse's name?
LIZA	Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
JERRY	Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.

JERRY	I bit the bastard's nose off.
LIZA	You bit someone's nose off?
JERRY	Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!

JERRY	It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
LIZA	Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
JERRY	You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.

JERRY	What's the charge?
LIZA	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.

LIZA	Just relax.
JERRY	Switch the charts.
LIZA	What?

JERRY	Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
LIZA	I'll see you tomorrow.

JERRY	Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
LIZA	What is?
JERRY	Love.

LIZA	People do have heart attacks.
JERRY	Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?

JERRY	It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
LIZA	You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
JERRY	You switched the charts; you tell me.
LIZA	I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
JERRY	Really?

JERRY	I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
LIZA	For what?
JERRY	You saved my life.
LIZA	<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.

LIZA	He says a dog bit his nose.
JERRY	Arf... You gotta help me.
LIZA	I can't promise you anything.

JERRY	Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
LIZA	Don't tell me you're naked back there.
JERRY	Figure of speech.  Could we go?

JERRY	What took so long?  You were in there all day.
LIZA	That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
JERRY	Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
LIZA	Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
JERRY	If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
LIZA	Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
JERRY	Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
LIZA	Them who?
JERRY	Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.

JERRY	Flat, wraparound headlights?
LIZA	Yeah.
JERRY	Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
LIZA	As opposed to?
JERRY	People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
LIZA	You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
JERRY	Yes.
LIZA	That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
JERRY	I noticed.

LIZA	See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
JERRY	Nothing is easy.
LIZA	How long have we known each other, Jerry?
JERRY	Six months.  Eleven days.
LIZA	Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?

LIZA	You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
JERRY	Yeah.  I think so.

LIZA	Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
JERRY	Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...

JERRY	More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
LIZA	What is it with you and the space program?
JERRY	And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'

JERRY	Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
LIZA	Do they have a secret handshake?

LIZA	That's it?
JERRY	I have no idea.

LIZA	So why are they after you?
JERRY	I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
LIZA	What newsletter?

JERRY	So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
LIZA	You're certifiable.
JERRY	You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
LIZA	Believe you about what?

LIZA	You okay?
JERRY	Flesh wound.  No big deal.

JERRY	You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
LIZA	Surprise me.
JERRY	The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.

JERRY	You want something to drink?
LIZA	Um, coffee.  If that's okay?

JERRY	If my universe had a hub...
LIZA	This would be it?

LIZA	Equitation.
JERRY	I've been reading up on it.
LIZA	Are these yours?

JERRY	Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
LIZA	'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
JERRY	Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
LIZA	Can you prove any of this?
JERRY	Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.

LIZA	'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
JERRY	Pretty scary, huh?
LIZA	Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
JERRY	Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
LIZA	You got a list?

LIZA	You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
JERRY	Who?
LIZA	Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
JERRY	Never heard of him.
LIZA	You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
JERRY	I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?

LIZA	What are you doing?
JERRY	Getting rid of my hub!

LIZA	Was that who I thought it was?
JERRY	Uh huh.
LIZA	Has this happened to you before?
JERRY	Never, but I've been practicing.
LIZA	Who are you, Jerry?
JERRY	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

JERRY	You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
LIZA	Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
JERRY	Shoot.
LIZA	It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
JERRY	I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
LIZA	It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
JERRY	So what's the question?
LIZA	How is it possible?

LIZA	I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
JERRY	Is this your dad?
LIZA	That was him.
JERRY	Is he dead?
LIZA	Please put it down.
JERRY	How'd he die?
LIZA	He was murdered.

JERRY	He's why you punish yourself.
LIZA	Not this again.
JERRY	You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
LIZA	You watch me, don't you?

JERRY	Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
LIZA	Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.

JERRY	Did you see the van back there?
LIZA	What van?
JERRY	Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
LIZA	Where'd you get your subscribers?
JERRY	I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
LIZA	Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
JERRY	You haven't been bothering them, have you?
LIZA	They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
JERRY	Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
LIZA	I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
JERRY	Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
LIZA	Realized what?
JERRY	Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.

LIZA	Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
JERRY	There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
LIZA	Cold War's over, Jerry.
JERRY	So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
LIZA	And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
JERRY	Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
LIZA	Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
JERRY	His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
LIZA	Murdered?
JERRY	Right here in Manhattan.
LIZA	It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
JERRY	Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
LIZA	Where then?

JERRY	Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
LIZA	What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
JERRY	I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
LIZA	They're big details, Jerry.
JERRY	Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
LIZA	A water main broke.
JERRY	They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
LIZA	Okay, I will.
JERRY	You will?
LIZA	If that's what you want.  Yes.

JERRY	I don't know what to say.  I love you.
LIZA	What?

JERRY	I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
LIZA	Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
JERRY	I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
LIZA	I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
JERRY	Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
LIZA	Jerry, I --
JERRY	What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
LIZA	If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
JERRY	Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
LIZA	Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.

JERRY	You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
LIZA	Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
JERRY	Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
LIZA	Now's not really the time to get into this --
JERRY	It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.

LIZA	Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
JERRY	I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
LIZA	I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
JERRY	I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?

JERRY	You look great.
LIZA	Thanks.

JERRY	Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
LIZA	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
JERRY	It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.

LIZA	What is it?
JERRY	There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.

LIZA	We're going to Queens?
JERRY	Not today.

LIZA	Now what?
JERRY	This way.

JERRY	After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
LIZA	Where are we going, Jerry?
JERRY	Connecticut.
LIZA	What's in Connecticut?

LIZA	What about them?
JERRY	How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
LIZA	John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
JERRY	Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.

LIZA	My father's house.
JERRY	Come on.

JERRY	How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
LIZA	You go.  Send me a postcard.

JERRY	Liza?
LIZA	Did you kill him?
JERRY	Is that what they told you?
LIZA	Did you kill my father?

LIZA	Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
JERRY	He gave it to me.
LIZA	I don't understand.
JERRY	Where were you the day he died?
LIZA	At a horse show.
JERRY	That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
LIZA	Did you kill my father?!
JERRY	No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.

LIZA	Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
JERRY	Yeah.  I know what it's like.
LIZA	Then tell me what happened.
JERRY	Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
LIZA	Love at first sight?
JERRY	I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
LIZA	Back where?
JERRY	To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.

LIZA	Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
JERRY	He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
LIZA	Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
JERRY	Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
LIZA	Why not?

LIZA	<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
JERRY	Because he believed me.

LIZA	How'd you get the picture?
JERRY	Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.

LIZA	I believe you.
JERRY	You do?

LIZA	You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
JERRY	They'll trace it.
LIZA	I'm sorry.
JERRY	It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.

JERRY	Blue moon... Blue moon...
LIZA	Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.

JERRY	Blue moon...
LIZA	You saw me standing alone ...

JERRY	Without a song in my heart.
LIZA	Without a love of my own.

JERRY	Blue moon...
LIZA	You knew just what I was there for.

JERRY	Liza?
LIZA	Where are you?

LIZA	How did you know?
JERRY	I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.

JERRY	Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
LIZA	What about you?
JERRY	Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.

LIZA	Geronimo is down.
JERRY	It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
LIZA	Don't do this.

LIZA	Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
JERRY	I can't promise you anything.

LIZA	You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
JERRY	Top pocket...  Go on.

JERRY	They changed Franklin's portrait.
LIZA	You think it's a conspiracy?
JERRY	Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.

LIZA	I love you, too.
JERRY	Now she tells me.

JERRY	Do I know you?
JONAS	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.

JONAS	I'm a very patient man.
JERRY	That's great.  Good for you.
JONAS	Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
JERRY	Could you be a little more specific?

JERRY	What's that?
JONAS	Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?

JONAS	We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
JERRY	<u>Liza</u>!
JONAS	You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
JERRY	You've never seen her run.

JONAS	Liza Sutton is dead.
JERRY	Then I can't be hurt anymore.

JERRY	Thank you.
LOWRY	You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
JERRY	I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
LOWRY	I'm not sure what you mean.
JERRY	You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
LOWRY	That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
JERRY	You're here because you figured I might show up.
LOWRY	It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
JERRY	I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
LOWRY	Well, I don't know if --

LOWRY	You made your decision yet?
JERRY	I'm leaning toward no.
LOWRY	That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.

JERRY	I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
LOWRY	We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
JERRY	That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
LOWRY	I don't know...
JERRY	Then screw you.  I'll rot.
LOWRY	Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
JERRY	Whatever.

LIZA	Can I ask you something?
JONAS	A dog bit it.
LIZA	Excuse me?
JONAS	You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
LIZA	And you feel bad for it?
JONAS	It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?

JONAS	So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
LIZA	You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
JONAS	And you have no idea where he lives?
LIZA	You've asked me that one three times.
JONAS	Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
LIZA	I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
JONAS	<u>Why you</u>?
LIZA	Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
JONAS	A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
LIZA	Excuse me?
JONAS	Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
LIZA	A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?

LIZA	Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
JONAS	The truth shall make you free.
LIZA	That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
JONAS	Only on the football field.

LIZA	I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
JONAS	We're very specialized.
LIZA	Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
JONAS	Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.

JONAS	If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
LIZA	Fine.  What the hell is going on?
JONAS	Please, sit.

JONAS	What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
LIZA	Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.

JONAS	Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
LIZA	It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
JONAS	A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
LIZA	Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
JONAS	M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
LIZA	As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
JONAS	I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.

JONAS	We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
LIZA	Terminal?
JONAS	As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
LIZA	If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
JONAS	Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
LIZA	Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
JONAS	It was.  It was.

LIZA	Jerry told me he bit your nose.
JONAS	And what did I say?
LIZA	A dog.
JONAS	<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
LIZA	These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
JONAS	Yes, that's right.

LIZA	I'm still listening.
JONAS	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
LIZA	I don't believe you.

JONAS	Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
LIZA	If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
JONAS	So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.

LIZA	Where'd you get it?
JONAS	You do recognize it then?
LIZA	It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
JONAS	I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
LIZA	Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
JONAS	Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
LIZA	You sound so sure.

JONAS	In Jerry's safety deposit box.
LIZA	I don't understand.

LIZA	It's okay.  I'm game.
JONAS	I want this box rigged with a beacon!

LAWYER	So, you doing anything tonight?
LIZA	Working.
LAWYER	Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
LIZA	Working.
LAWYER	Night after that?
LIZA	Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
LAWYER	I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
LIZA	Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'

LAWYER	Liza, settle a bet for us.
LIZA	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?

OPERATOR	Federal Bureau of Investigation.
LIZA	I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
OPERATOR	The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
LIZA	Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?

OPERATOR	Yes.
LIZA	Then this is a goddamn emergency.

OPERATOR	Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
LIZA	Agent Lowry?

WILSON	Ah, your psychotic is here.
LIZA	Not today...

LIZA	Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
WILSON	I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.

WILSON	I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
LIZA	This doesn't make sense.
WILSON	It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
LIZA	I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
WILSON	Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
LIZA	We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
WILSON	I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
LIZA	-- Understood.

LIZA	Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
WILSON	What the hell does that mean?

LOWRY	We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
LIZA	Tell me about it.
LOWRY	While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
LIZA	Wait --

LOWRY	Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
LIZA	You don't understand --

LOWRY	Which way did he go?
LIZA	I don't know.  Didn't see him.

LOWRY	That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
LIZA	I was just thinking that.

LOWRY	You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
LIZA	No.  Not yet.

LIZA	Agent Lowry.
LOWRY	Wasn't my idea.
LIZA	Jonas?
LOWRY	It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?

LIZA	When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
LOWRY	Your call.  Have a good night.

LIZA	Can I talk to you a second?
LOWRY	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.

LIZA	Do you believe me?
LOWRY	Yeah, I do.
LIZA	I want to believe you, too.
LOWRY	What do you mean?

LIZA	Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
LOWRY	You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.

LOWRY	What gave me away?
LIZA	Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?

LOWRY	I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
LIZA	And Jonas?
LOWRY	He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
LIZA	He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
LOWRY	Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
LIZA	Where do you think Jerry is?
LOWRY	No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
LIZA	I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
LOWRY	Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
LIZA	What do you suggest?
LOWRY	That you come with me.
LIZA	I don't think so.

AGENT HADLEY	We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
SAMI	So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
AGENT HADLEY	Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.

AGENT HADLEY	Agent Hadley.
SAMI	Do you know who this is?
AGENT HADLEY	Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
SAMI	If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.

SAMI	What are you doing?
AGENT HADLEY	You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
SAMI	Wired?    I ain't wired.

AGENT HADLEY	Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
SAMI	You killed her!
AGENT HADLEY	No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
SAMI	Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
AGENT HADLEY	You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
SAMI	Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
AGENT HADLEY	Where are the tapes?
SAMI	I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
AGENT HADLEY	A pass.
SAMI	A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
AGENT HADLEY	Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
SAMI	They don't have a murder weapon?
AGENT HADLEY	No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?

SAMI	You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY	I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI	You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
SAMI	What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
AGENT HADLEY	When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
SAMI	And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.

SAMI	What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
AGENT HADLEY	Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

SAMI	You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY	I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI	You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

SOPHIE	Zero.   That's all I know.
AGENT HADLEY	You'll never get out of the city.

AGENT HADLEY	This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
SOPHIE	Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
AGENT HADLEY	I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
SOPHIE	They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
AGENT HADLEY	Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
SOPHIE	I thought you wanted Zammito?
AGENT HADLEY	What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.

AGENT HADLEY	Too many people know about my involvement in this.
SOPHIE	Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.

WAYNE	Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
AGENT HADLEY	Not today.   Where are your friends?
WAYNE	They left about a half hour ago.
AGENT HADLEY	Where did they go?
WAYNE	I dunno.

WAYNE	Hey man, you can't do that!
AGENT HADLEY	What?   This?

WAYNE	Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
AGENT HADLEY	I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
WAYNE	I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.

BASTALDI	Hello?
MARCEL	It's Elvis...
BASTALDI	Who?
MARCEL	It's me...
BASTALDI	Marcel?

MARCEL	Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
BASTALDI	You're there now?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
MARCEL	No.
BASTALDI	You're calling me on is phone?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	My number's going to show up on his bill!
MARCEL	Should I call you back?

BASTALDI	You've already robbed the safe?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	Take what you've got and get out of there.

DANIEL	Where's your brother?
BASTALDI	Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?

BASTALDI	Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
DANIEL	Uh, yeah.
BASTALDI	Good.   I have a job for you in America.

BASTALDI	Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
DANIEL	C'mon, Laurant, America?
BASTALDI	The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.

BASTALDI	I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
DANIEL	What?
BASTALDI	This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
DANIEL	You don't trust me?
BASTALDI	I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.

BASTALDI	Hello?
DANIEL	It's Daniel.
BASTALDI	Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
DANIEL	-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
BASTALDI	A million! I don't have that kind of money.
DANIEL	Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
BASTALDI	I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
DANIEL	Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.

BOBBY BEANS	Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
ZAMMITO	Good.   I'm good.
BOBBY BEANS	Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
ZAMMITO	When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

ZAMMITO	Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
BOBBY BEANS	No thank you.
ZAMMITO	You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
BOBBY BEANS	I'm good.   Really.
ZAMMITO	Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
BOBBY BEANS	Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
ZAMMITO	-- Super what?
BOBBY BEANS	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
ZAMMITO	Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
BOBBY BEANS	I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
ZAMMITO	Okay.   How much?
BOBBY BEANS	I'm not here to negotiate.
ZAMMITO	Why are you here?
BOBBY BEANS	To tell you that we're interested in the property.
ZAMMITO	You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
BOBBY BEANS	I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
ZAMMITO	Yeah -- you do that.

BONANNO	Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
ZAMMITO	No, I'm good, Angelo.

BONANNO	I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
ZAMMITO	Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
BONANNO	And?
ZAMMITO	And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
BONANNO	He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
ZAMMITO	He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
BONANNO	Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
ZAMMITO	I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.

BONANNO	They're gonna be what?
ZAMMITO	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
BONANNO	Good word.

ZAMMITO	Someone else coming?
BONANNO	Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
ZAMMITO	Uh, no --
BONANNO	You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
ZAMMITO	You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.

BONANNO	Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
ZAMMITO	He missed three weeks.
BONANNO	Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
ZAMMITO	I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
BONANNO	But you were there?
ZAMMITO	Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.

BONANNO	Why didn't you tell me about this?
ZAMMITO	You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.

BONANNO	They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
ZAMMITO	Yes.
BONANNO	What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
ZAMMITO	Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
BONANNO	We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?

BONANNO	Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
DANIEL	I guess we're going to find out.
BONANNO	You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
DANIEL	Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?

DANIEL	I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
BONANNO	I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
DANIEL	He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
BONANNO	I assume you want something?
DANIEL	We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
BONANNO	You want me to help you get out of the country?

BONANNO	And for my help I would get what?
DANIEL	Half the tapes.
BONANNO	And the other half?
DANIEL	I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
BONANNO	I only have your word for that.
DANIEL	I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
BONANNO	Where are you staying?

BONANNO	I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
DANIEL	How about if I call you?

BONANNO	This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
DANIEL	Thank you.
BONANNO	You have something for me?

DANIEL	Tonight?
SOPHIE	I know they won't be home tonight.

SOPHIE	I don't know.
DANIEL	If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.

DANIEL	For what?
SOPHIE	Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
DANIEL	What kind of business?
SOPHIE	Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.

DANIEL	You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
RAYMOND	You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.

DANIEL	Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
RAYMOND	No problem.

RAYMOND	Yeah.   We just go home.
DANIEL	We can't.
RAYMOND	I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.

RAYMOND	No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
DANIEL	We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

DANIEL	Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
RAYMOND	She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --

RAYMOND	Why not just steal another one?
DANIEL	Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.

DANIEL	Get that, will you?
RAYMOND	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
DANIEL	Because you're the closest.
RAYMOND	I'm not any closer than you are.

DANIEL	Why is everything an argument with you?
RAYMOND	I'm just setting my boundaries.

DANIEL	Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
RAYMOND	Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
DANIEL	Jesus!

DANIEL	In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
ZERO	Where are you from?

DANIEL	Hopefully no one.
ZERO	No one? Then why is Zero here?

DANIEL	I just want you there in case there's trouble.
ZERO	And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
DANIEL	We'll see.

DANIEL	He said to go fuck yourself.
ZERO	We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.

ZERO	We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
DANIEL	Cops?

DANIEL	Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
ZERO	You want Zero to kill him?
DANIEL	I'm going to kill him myself!
ZERO	What about the money?

DANIEL	Bring me the scissors.
ZERO	And the Vodka.

DANIEL	Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
ZERO	And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.

DANIEL	Turn on the flashlight.
JULIEN	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

JULIEN	Do they come with batteries?
DANIEL	You didn't buy batteries?
JULIEN	I thought they came with batteries.
DANIEL	I can't believe you didn't check.
JULIEN	I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
DANIEL	Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

DANIEL	Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
JULIEN	What for?
DANIEL	We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.

JULIEN	That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
DANIEL	We'll think of something.

DANIEL	Besides, we don't know the city and--
MARCEL	Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!

MARCEL	You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
DANIEL	I think he's already figured that out.

DANIEL	That moron.
MARCEL	It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
DANIEL	Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.

MARCEL	The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
DANIEL	You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.

DANIEL	Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
MARCEL	No.
DANIEL	You're sure?
MARCEL	I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.

MARCEL	Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
DANIEL	Do I?
MARCEL	This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.

DANIEL	You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
MARCEL	Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.

MARCEL	I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
DANIEL	What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?

DANIEL	We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
MARCEL	We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
DANIEL	I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.

DANIEL	We still have to get out of here.
MARCEL	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

DANIEL	This is Zero.
SAMI	Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.

SAMI	After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
DANIEL	Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.

SAMI	We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
DANIEL	Good idea.
SAMI	I'll be Elvis and you--

DANIEL	It's not?
SAMI	That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.

SAMI	How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
DANIEL	I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

SAMI	What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
DANIEL	You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
SAMI	No.   Chicks dig me.

SAMI	They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
DANIEL	You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
SAMI	We have to find Sophie.

SAMI	It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
DANIEL	I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.

SAMI	All right, knock it off.
DANIEL	All you are is a professional ass-kisser.

SAMI	Hadley --
DANIEL	Has to be.

SAMI	It's not your fault, Daniel.
DANIEL	No?

DANIEL	Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
SAMI	Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

DANIEL	Hello?
SAMI	Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

SAMI	What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
DANIEL	He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

SAMI	Anybody hungry?
DANIEL	What'd you get?
SAMI	Some bread and...

SAMI	What?
DANIEL	Can I trust you, Sami?
SAMI	Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
DANIEL	If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
SAMI	No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
DANIEL	You haven't answered my question.
SAMI	Does it really matter what I say?
DANIEL	I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
SAMI	I will.
DANIEL	You better.

SAMI	Did you have to use that much explosive?
DANIEL	I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

DANIEL	I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
LAMAR	What do you want now?
DANIEL	Guns.   Can you get them?
LAMAR	Man, I can get anything.
DANIEL	Don't bullshit me.
LAMAR	I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
DANIEL	I've got a way with people.
LAMAR	I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
DANIEL	I'm from Belgium.
LAMAR	Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
DANIEL	Why haven't you turned us in?
LAMAR	I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?

LAMAR	And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
DANIEL	How much?
LAMAR	A thousand dollars?
DANIEL	Fine.

LAMAR	Yeah?
DANIEL	It's me.
LAMAR	Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
DANIEL	-- Did you set it up?
LAMAR	Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
DANIEL	We had a deal.
LAMAR	We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
DANIEL	Fine.     Ten o'clock.

DANIEL	There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
LAMAR	What?
DANIEL	I'll tell you when it's time.

LAMAR	Okay, we're square now, right?
DANIEL	There's just one more thing I need you to do.

HECTOR	Maybe you should call the police.
RAPHAEL	Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
HECTOR	I just thought that--
RAPHAEL	-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.

HECTOR	-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
RAPHAEL	Hector, don't interrupt me.
HECTOR	He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
RAPHAEL	I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?

RAPHAEL	Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
HECTOR	Hard to say.

ZAMMITO	What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	You said don't do it, boss.
ZAMMITO	That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	Hey boss, it's not a science.
ZAMMITO	Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

ZAMMITO	They were all French guys.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	French guys?    You mean like from France?
ZAMMITO	Yeah, French guys from France.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	What'd they take?
ZAMMITO	Everything.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Everything?
ZAMMITO	Everything.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Boy, you must be pissed.
ZAMMITO	Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
ZAMMITO	You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Okay boss.   Where are they?
ZAMMITO	If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
ZAMMITO	Just find them!
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Okay boss.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
ZAMMITO	Oh, I'm sorry.

ZAMMITO	Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Good song though.
ZAMMITO	Great fuckin' song.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	What'd you guys find?
UNIFORMED COP	Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	And the other car?
UNIFORMED COP	Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
UNIFORMED COP	No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
UNIFORMED COP	A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	What hotel?
UNIFORMED COP	The Holiday Hotel.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	What room number?
UNIFORMED COP	I don't know.     I didn't look.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Go look.

MARCEL	The map said to go left.
JULIEN	Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
MARCEL	Oh yeah.

MARCEL	There has to be.
JULIEN	I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
MARCEL	There must be half a million dollars here though.

JULIEN	What do we do?
MARCEL	I was told to take what we have and go.
JULIEN	Go where?   The police are outside.

SOPHIE	They don't have a wine list.
JULIEN	Oh, then we will have the house wine.

SOPHIE	There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
JULIEN	I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

JULIEN	What about transportation?
SOPHIE	You can use my car.

SOPHIE	No, I didn't.
JULIEN	Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
SOPHIE	Yes.
JULIEN	And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
SOPHIE	No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.

SAMI	I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
JULIEN	What is it you do, Sami?
SAMI	You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
JULIEN	I see.   A master criminal.
SAMI	Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.

SAMI	They don't serve wine here.
JULIEN	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
SAMI	This kind.
JULIEN	Okay.    I will have a beer.

JULIEN	I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
SAMI	C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.

SAMI	No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
JULIEN	This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.

JULIEN	I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
SAMI	Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.

JULIEN	This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
SAMI	Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
JULIEN	Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
SAMI	We've got to get out of here.
JULIEN	That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?

JULIEN	Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
SAMI	It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.

JULIEN	Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
RAYMOND	She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.

RAYMOND	I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
JULIEN	Relax. It will be fine.

JULIEN	I'll drive.
RAYMOND	I'm the driver.
JULIEN	I've never driven a Cadillac before.

JULIEN	This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
RAYMOND	This is the only American car you've ever driven.

RAYMOND	I knew I should have driven.
JULIEN	Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

JULIEN	When we get to the next corner jump out.
RAYMOND	I'm not going to leave you.
JULIEN	We both know I'm already dead.

RAYMOND	A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
MARCEL	Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
RAYMOND	There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
MARCEL	What the hell is he talking about?
RAYMOND	I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
MARCEL	How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?

MARCEL	No.   How much?
RAYMOND	I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

MARCEL	How about Canada?
RAYMOND	What are we going to do, take a taxi?

MARCEL	Going somewhere?
SAMI	Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

MARCEL	Today's your lucky day, Sami.
SAMI	Yeah, I can see that.
MARCEL	Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
SAMI	Me?
MARCEL	You lived there. You know the city.
SAMI	I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

MARCEL	-- I want to be Elvis.
SAMI	It's my idea.
MARCEL	C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
SAMI	Okay.   You can be Elvis.

SAMI	We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
MARCEL	Mr. Taylor?
SAMI	No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

MARCEL	Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

SAMI	Vase with twelve Sunflowers.
MARCEL	Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

SAMI	You guys used to work together?
MARCEL	Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.

SAMI	It's good.
MARCEL	God, I want to go home.
SAMI	Hey, you know you can't this in France.

SAMI	This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
MARCEL	The baseball is mine.
SAMI	No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

MARCEL	Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
SAMI	No.
MARCEL	Give it to me, Sami.
SAMI	No!

ZAMMITO	How's my brother?
NICKY "THE RAKE"	He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
ZAMMITO	I said a clean break.

NICKY "THE RAKE"	Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
ZAMMITO	Get in the car.
NICKY "THE RAKE"	Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

ZAMMITO	What happened?
NICKY "THE RAKE"	They sort of got away.
ZAMMITO	I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.

RAPHAEL	Anybody know about that car outside?
ZAMMITO	Yeah.   It's mine.
RAPHAEL	No.   It's mine.
ZAMMITO	The hell it is.
RAPHAEL	I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
ZAMMITO	And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
RAPHAEL	Fuck you, grease-ball!
ZAMMITO	Fuck me?   Fuck you!

RAYMOND	Mr. Zammito?
VINNY	Uh huh.
RAYMOND	I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
VINNY	I don't know what you're talking about.
RAYMOND	I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
VINNY	How?
RAYMOND	You see that car?

VINNY	Yeah.
RAYMOND	It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
VINNY	No shit?
RAYMOND	The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

RAYMOND	I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
WAYNE	No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
RAYMOND	No thank you.

RAYMOND	Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
WAYNE	Yeah, I dig him.
RAYMOND	Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?

RAYMOND	How are we going to do that?
WAYNE	I know where she went.

RAYMOND	I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
WAYNE	Cool.

SAMI	He speaks about himself in the third person?
RAYMOND	Feel free to correct him if you want.

SAMI	I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
RAYMOND	Watch this.

RAYMOND	I think we went the wrong way.
SAMI	Oh, you think?

SAMI	Holy shit.
RAYMOND	What?

RAYMOND	How do we know what room she's in?
SAMI	Wait here.

RAYMOND	The money isn't here.
SAMI	Where is it, Sophie?

SAMI	I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
RAYMOND	It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.

SAMI	You're not helping.
RAYMOND	Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.

SAMI	I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
RAYMOND	He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?

RAYMOND	The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
SAMI	I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
RAYMOND	J&amp;B?
SAMI	Glenmorangie.
RAYMOND	Glenmorangie is very good.

SAMI	Algeria.
ZERO	And you don't speak French?
SAMI	Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
ZERO	-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?

SAMI	You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
ZERO	Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.

SAMI	I can't even hear myself think.
ZERO	How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?

SAMI	They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
ZERO	What does arresting us get them?
SAMI	You wanna tell him?

SAMI	It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
ZERO	We don't know that for sure.

ZERO	And how do we do that?
SAMI	I don't know.

ZERO	They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
SAMI	He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.

SOPHIE	I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
SAMI	Thanks.

SAMI	When do we go?
SOPHIE	Tonight.

SAMI	You ever hear of jet lag?
SOPHIE	Take a nap.

SOPHIE	You like shoes?
SAMI	No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
SOPHIE	It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.

SOPHIE	So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
SAMI	Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
SOPHIE	The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
SAMI	So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
SOPHIE	They're not nice people.

SOPHIE	Casandra. Old girlfriend?
SAMI	Something like that.
SOPHIE	Did she break your heart?
SAMI	Something like that.
SOPHIE	It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
SAMI	You ask a lot of questions.
SOPHIE	That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
SAMI	I don't remember.    I was drunk.
SOPHIE	You got it in a bar?
SAMI	No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
SOPHIE	Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
SAMI	It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
SOPHIE	I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.

SAMI	Who's gonna see it there?
SOPHIE	The lucky ones.

SOPHIE	Can't sleep?
SAMI	No.
SOPHIE	I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
SAMI	It's not your fault.

SOPHIE	What are you doing?
SAMI	I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
SOPHIE	Sounds boring.
SAMI	It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.

SAMI	I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
SOPHIE	After last night I could say the same for you.

SAMI	Who are you waiting for?
SOPHIE	Stick around and find out.

SAMI	Why?
SOPHIE	Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

VINNY	Frankie, I --
ZAMMITO	-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.

VINNY	Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
ZAMMITO	That's why we're only breaking one arm.

ZAMMITO	She seems pleasant enough.
VINNY	She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
ZAMMITO	That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.

ZAMMITO	So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
VINNY	You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
ZAMMITO	Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
VINNY	Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
ZAMMITO	I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
VINNY	A little?
ZAMMITO	Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
VINNY	You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
ZAMMITO	What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.

ZAMMITO	What's this?
VINNY	A car.
ZAMMITO	Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
VINNY	It's for you.
ZAMMITO	For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
VINNY	I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
ZAMMITO	Okay.    Okay.
VINNY	I'll get you the papers tomorrow.

BENNETT	Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
GALLAGHER	What'cha got, Bennett?
BENNETT	Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
GALLAGHER	Technothugs?
BENNETT	No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
GALLAGHER	I can smell it.

GALLAGHER	That's him.  Simon Doucet.
BENNETT	Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
GALLAGHER	This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
BENNETT	Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
GALLAGHER	I want this bastard brought down.

GALLAGHER	Yeah?
BENNETT	Wade's here.

GALLAGHER	Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
BENNETT	Wade did a little reminiscing.

KIMBERLY	Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
CASSY	What did you say?
KIMBERLY	I'd think about it.

KIMBERLY	Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
CASSY	He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
KIMBERLY	I think he wants more than your cookies.
CASSY	Kimberly!
KIMBERLY	Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.

DUBBS	Who is it?
SANCHEZ	Avon Lady!

SANCHEZ	My man Dubbs.
DUBBS	Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?

SANCHEZ	I want to ask you a few questions.
DUBBS	No, you're not model material.  Anything else?

SANCHEZ	Funny guy.
DUBBS	Fuck you - fuck you.
SANCHEZ	You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
DUBBS	Your mother.

SANCHEZ	Speak up.
DUBBS	It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.

DUBBS	I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
SANCHEZ	Prepare for a change in lifestyle.

DUBBS	It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
SANCHEZ	Put that on your political resume.

WADE	Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
GALLAGHER	Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
WADE	Shucks, and I got all dressed up.

GALLAGHER	Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
WADE	I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
GALLAGHER	Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.

WADE	I'm not on the force anymore.
GALLAGHER	Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
WADE	I want to see my wife and kid.
GALLAGHER	Later.  I want Doucet first.
WADE	I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
GALLAGHER	I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.

WADE	What's this?
GALLAGHER	Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.

GALLAGHER	Mug sheets.
WADE	I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.

GALLAGHER	Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
WADE	He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
GALLAGHER	No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.

WADE	You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
GALLAGHER	We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
WADE	Give it to me.
GALLAGHER	When you bring in Doucet.

GALLAGHER	The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
WADE	I'm going to kill you when this is all over.

GALLAGHER	You're working a partner on this.
WADE	I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.

GALLAGHER	Hello Wade.
WADE	Out of the room.

WADE	Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
GALLAGHER	I'll be alright.

GALLAGHER	You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
WADE	I'm not voting for you.
GALLAGHER	Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.

WADE	I want to stop aging.
GALLAGHER	And I want Doucet.

GALLAGHER	This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
WADE	Remember my promise.
GALLAGHER	Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
WADE	Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?

GALLAGHER	Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
WADE	Where?

WADE	I'm wasting time.
GALLAGHER	You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
WADE	Not anymore.

GALLAGHER	What is it?  I'm about to go on.
WADE	We have to talk.
GALLAGHER	I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
WADE	That wasn't your plan, was it?
GALLAGHER	What are you talking about?

WADE	You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
GALLAGHER	You're crazy.
WADE	<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.

GALLAGHER	I don't want to hear anymore.
WADE	You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.

GALLAGHER	That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
SANCHEZ	I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.

GALLAGHER	Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
SANCHEZ	He could be brought back.

GALLAGHER	Kill him... kill him.
SANCHEZ	Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.

GALLAGHER	Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
SANCHEZ	We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
GALLAGHER	Forget it.  Stick to the program.

GALLAGHER	You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
SANCHEZ	But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
GALLAGHER	I'm thrilled beyond belief.

SANCHEZ	Sir, your transmission's fading.
GALLAGHER	What the hell are you talking about?

GALLAGHER	You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
SANCHEZ	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.

GALLAGHER	What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
WARDEN	It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
GALLAGHER	Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
WARDEN	Telephone repairman.

GALLAGHER	Just great.
WARDEN	NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
GALLAGHER	I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.

PEEBLES	Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
GALLAGHER	Fine.
PEEBLES	I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.

PEEBLES	Sir, your limo's here.
GALLAGHER	Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.

PEEBLES	You okay?
GALLAGHER	How do I look?
PEEBLES	Aces.

PEEBLES	Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
GALLAGHER	Keep 'em busy.

PEEBLES	Sir---
GALLAGHER	Shut up!  Drop it.

KIMBERLY	Need help?
WILLY	I got it.  I got it.
KIMBERLY	You sure?  I can help you.
WILLY	Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
KIMBERLY	Nobody's looking.
WILLY	Go in the house.

KIMBERLY	Maybe I should put on the training whe---
WILLY	Not the 'T' word.
KIMBERLY	Ooops, I forgot.

WADE	You my partner?
SANCHEZ	Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
WADE	Are you a cop?
SANCHEZ	Yes.
WADE	Well, that's good enough for me.

WADE	I drive.
SANCHEZ	Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
WADE	I'm ready.
SANCHEZ	But Sergeant...
WADE	Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.

WADE	Does it drive itself, too?
SANCHEZ	You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
WADE	Got it.  Ejection seat?
SANCHEZ	Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
WADE	Lean year for role models.

WADE	I have to go home, Sanchez.
SANCHEZ	Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.

WADE	No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
SANCHEZ	Doucet killed my partner.

WADE	See those guys?
SANCHEZ	Technothugs.

WADE	They're going to rob that bank.
SANCHEZ	How do you know?
WADE	Some things never change.

SANCHEZ	I'll inform dispatch.
WADE	There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
SANCHEZ	We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
WADE	Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.

SANCHEZ	You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
WADE	I'm not fond of television comedies.

WADE	Wanna come?
SANCHEZ	My insurance won't cover it.

SANCHEZ	Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
WADE	Pass.

SANCHEZ	Can I ask you something?
WADE	Yes.
SANCHEZ	When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?

SANCHEZ	Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
WADE	Bacon cheeseburgers.
SANCHEZ	Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
WADE	Trust me.  You don't want to know.

WADE	Hey, buddy...
SANCHEZ	Relax, let technology do the work.

SANCHEZ	NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
WADE	You can't catch this man with a computer.
SANCHEZ	How then?
WADE	You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.

SANCHEZ	Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
WADE	GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
SANCHEZ	I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
WADE	Drop it.

SANCHEZ	Why?
WADE	I was set up.

SANCHEZ	You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
WADE	'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
SANCHEZ	It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
WADE	Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

WADE	Married?
SANCHEZ	Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
WADE	Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.

SANCHEZ	What's this place?
WADE	This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.

WADE	Yeah.
SANCHEZ	Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.

WADE	She's pretty.
SANCHEZ	Thanks.

SANCHEZ	You need anything else?
WADE	I'll be okay.
SANCHEZ	Good night, Wade.
WADE	Good night.

WADE	I'll have a cup of coffee?
SANCHEZ	Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.

WADE	No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
SANCHEZ	We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
WADE	Hey, I'm eating.
SANCHEZ	I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
WADE	You want to be a good detective?
SANCHEZ	Yes, sir.
WADE	Then find me some cigarettes.

WADE	Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
SANCHEZ	That cost me two weeks' pay.

SANCHEZ	Maybe I should turn myself in.
WADE	Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.

SANCHEZ	Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
WADE	Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
SANCHEZ	I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
WADE	With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
SANCHEZ	You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.

WADE	Wanna try?
SANCHEZ	No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
WADE	You're not pregnant, are you?
SANCHEZ	No, sir.

SANCHEZ	Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
WADE	What else did he get?
SANCHEZ	Wallet, cash, I.D...
WADE	Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.

WADE	Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
SANCHEZ	Simulated one.

WADE	Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
SANCHEZ	<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.

SANCHEZ	Rip Van Winkle.
WADE	How ya feeling?
SANCHEZ	How do I look?
WADE	Not too good.

SANCHEZ	What's this?
WADE	We're partners, aren't we?

WADE	Sanchez...?
SANCHEZ	I'm here.
WADE	You treat her nice.
SANCHEZ	...What are you talking about...?
WADE	Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
SANCHEZ	...Have you been drinking?
WADE	Not yet.

WADE	Yeah.
SANCHEZ	This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
WADE	So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
SANCHEZ	That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.

WADE	You okay?
SANCHEZ	Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
WADE	What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
SANCHEZ	Hospital food.

WADE	What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
SANCHEZ	If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.

SANCHEZ	I just heard.
WADE	He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
SANCHEZ	You be careful.
WADE	I'm signing off.

SANCHEZ	No.  I want to be with you.
WADE	No you don't.

WADE	You should be in hospital.
SANCHEZ	And you should be with your family.

SHEPPARD	Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
SANCHEZ	This is the guy that killed my partner.
SHEPPARD	You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
SANCHEZ	Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?

SHEPPARD	Demolition Man.
SANCHEZ	What's it mean?
SHEPPARD	You never want to find out.
SANCHEZ	Take a look at this.

SANCHEZ	He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
SHEPPARD	He went dirty and they made an example of him.
SANCHEZ	But he was such a good cop.
SHEPPARD	They always are.
SANCHEZ	Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.

WADE	You all right?
WILLY	Yeah.
WADE	Seat's too high.
WILLY	My mom says I'm gonna grow.

WADE	Yes.
WILLY	My granddad was a policeman.

WILLY	I'm going to be a policeman.
WADE	What's your name?
WILLY	William Simpson.  I like Willy.
WADE	Good to know you, Willy.

WILLY	Bye.  Thanks.
WADE	Remember, get the seat fixed.

WHORE	Hi.
WADE	Hi.
WHORE	Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?

WHORE	Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
WADE	This little thing says I can't.
WHORE	You could always take it off.
WADE	It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.

WHORE	Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
WADE	I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.

PITER	My Lord!
BARON	Piter.

PITER	The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
BARON	What does Leto say, Piter?
PITER	He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
BARON	I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.

BARON	It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
PITER	The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
BARON	You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

DUKE LETO	So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
KYNES	I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
DUKE LETO	This is my son, Paul.

DUKE LETO	I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
KYNES	They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.

DUKE LETO	My thanks.
KYNES	With your permission...

DUKE LETO	What happens now?
KYNES	The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

DUKE LETO	What's that you're saying?
KYNES	Nothing.

EMPEROR	A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
REVEREND MOTHER	We felt his presence.
EMPEROR	I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
REVEREND MOTHER	Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
EMPEROR	Yes?
REVEREND MOTHER	Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
EMPEROR	He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
REVEREND MOTHER	I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.

REVEREND MOTHER	Yes, my Lord.
EMPEROR	We are alone...

NAVIGATOR	We have just folded space from Ix...
EMPEROR	Yes?... How was your journey?
NAVIGATOR	Many machines on Ix... new machines.
EMPEROR	Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.

NAVIGATOR	I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
EMPEROR	Yes.

NAVIGATOR	You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
NAVIGATOR	So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
EMPEROR	Yes.

EMPEROR	Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
NAVIGATOR	LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.

EMPEROR	I can assure you...
NAVIGATOR	Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

KYNES	So, this is Leto the Just...
GURNEY	I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
KYNES	Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...

GURNEY	The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
KYNES	Basically...
GURNEY	Sire!

GURNEY	Yes, Sire.
KYNES	It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.

GURNEY	Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
KYNES	That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.

GURNEY	No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
PAUL	Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
GURNEY	Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
PAUL	I'm sorry Gurney.
GURNEY	Not sorry enough.

PAUL	What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
PAUL	Is this what you seek?
GURNEY	Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.

GURNEY	We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
PAUL	Would you really have drawn my blood?
GURNEY	If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.

PAUL	Things have been so serious here lately.
GURNEY	Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.

PAUL	You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
GURNEY	Paul!!  Paul!!
PAUL	Don't you trust your own eyes.
GURNEY	They said you were dead.  They said...

PAUL	Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
GURNEY	My Lord?
PAUL	Let him stand free!

GURNEY	This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
PAUL	The Emperor's blade.

STILGAR	Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
STILGAR	Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
JESSICA	No, but many consider my training valuable.
STILGAR	I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.

STILGAR	Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
JESSICA	Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.

STILGAR	Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
JESSICA	They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
STILGAR	Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
JESSICA	I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?

MAPES	You know the ancient tongues?
JESSICA	I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
MAPES	As the legend says.
JESSICA	That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.

MAPES	Do you know this my lady?
JESSICA	It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
MAPES	Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
JESSICA	Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...

JESSICA	Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
MAPES	My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.

JESSICA	Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
JESSICA	Your Reverence.
PAUL	What does she fear?  What about my Father?
JESSICA	Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

PAUL	Don't touch my mother...
JESSICA	Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.

PAUL	Remove her gag!
JESSICA	Excellent!

PAUL	I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
JESSICA	Where are we do you think?
PAUL	The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...

JESSICA	A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
PAUL	 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...

PAUL	Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
PAUL	The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
JESSICA	Is he....?
PAUL	You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
JESSICA	He knows.
PAUL	You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...

PAUL	It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
JESSICA	 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...

PAUL	Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
JESSICA	I'm ready.

PAUL	Run!
JESSICA	I can't... I can't.

PAUL	Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
JESSICA	Yes...
PAUL	I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.

JESSICA	What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
PAUL	Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.

JESSICA	Man-carved steps.
PAUL	Yes...

JESSICA	Stop him yourself.
PAUL	You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.

PAUL	Are you a Fremen?
KYNES	I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
PAUL	He's hiding something.

KYNES	You've worn a stillsuit before?
PAUL	No.
KYNES	Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
PAUL	No one. It... seemed the proper way.
KYNES	That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.

PAUL	Will we see a worm?
KYNES	Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
PAUL	Always?
KYNES	Always.
PAUL	Why do they come?
KYNES	To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?

PAUL	Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
KYNES	Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.

PAUL	Liet?
KYNES	You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!

STILGAR	You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
PAUL	What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
STILGAR	We call that one Muad'dib.
PAUL	Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
STILGAR	You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.

PAUL	Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
STILGAR	Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...

STILGAR	The Water of Life.
PAUL	The most lethal poison in the Universe.

PAUL	My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
STILGAR	Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.

PAUL	We surprised a band of smugglers.
STILGAR	Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

PAUL	Long live the fighters!
STILGAR	Long live the fighters!

PAUL	What's in the box?
REVEREND MOTHER	Pain.

PAUL	The Voice again.
REVEREND MOTHER	I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
PAUL	Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
REVEREND MOTHER	Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
PAUL	It burns.
REVEREND MOTHER	SILENCE... SILENCE.
PAUL	 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
REVEREND MOTHER	You feel the flesh crisping?

PAUL	THE PAIN!
REVEREND MOTHER	NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!

REVEREND MOTHER	Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
PAUL	I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?

REVEREND MOTHER	Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
PAUL	Not all of them... I know which ones will.
REVEREND MOTHER	Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
PAUL	What is it?
REVEREND MOTHER	The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
PAUL	Where?
REVEREND MOTHER	Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
PAUL	I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
PAUL	Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died....  Jessica!

REVEREND MOTHER	I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
PAUL	I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!

PAUL	Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
REVEREND MOTHER	What can be done has been done.
PAUL	MOTHER! Tell me!

REVEREND MOTHER	... Many men have tried.
PAUL	Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died.

PAUL	Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
REVEREND MOTHER	Stop him, Jessica!

REVEREND MOTHER	You mustn't speak of...
PAUL	SILENCE!

PAUL	I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
THUFIR	Those sounds could be imitated.
PAUL	I'd know the difference.

THUFIR	Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
PAUL	My father sent you to test me. Music then?

THUFIR	Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
PAUL	The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!

THUFIR	Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
PAUL	I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
THUFIR	We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

DEAN	Brill?
BRILL	Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.

BRILL	What happened?
DEAN	It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.

BRILL	DePinto's dead.
DEAN	Oh Jesus.
BRILL	They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?

DEAN	I don't know anything about Zavitz.
BRILL	You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
DEAN	<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.

BRILL	And you were the last one to talk to him.
DEAN	Yes.
BRILL	What'd he say to you?
DEAN	Nothing.
BRILL	What'd he give to you?
DEAN	Nothing.
BRILL	Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
DEAN	I'm telling you, I--

DEAN	I just gave him my card.
BRILL	He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
DEAN	Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

DEAN	Um...who's that?
BRILL	Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
DEAN	Someone else?
BRILL	Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.

BRILL	209 to anyone! I need some help here!
DEAN	Who are you calling?!

DEAN	It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
ALBERT	I don't know what that means.
DEAN	Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
ALBERT	So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
DEAN	I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
ALBERT	You're not.

ALFONSO	Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
ZAVITZ	Listen to me--
ALFONSO	Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
ZAVITZ	Listen--
ALFONSO	Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
ZAVITZ	Turn on CNN.
ALFONSO	They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
ZAVITZ	Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
ALFONSO	Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
ZAVITZ	Do it!

ALFONSO	You've got it on tape?
ZAVITZ	Clear as day.
ALFONSO	Who else have you told?

ZAVITZ	No one. But I'm a little nervous.
ALFONSO	When can you get it here?
ZAVITZ	I'm doing a transfer now.
ALFONSO	Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
ZAVITZ	I'll come straight there.
ALFONSO	Be careful, Danny.

BLAKE	We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
DEAN	Why?
BLAKE	They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.

BLAKE	It is?
DEAN	Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.

BLAKE	Tell us about Rachel Banks.
DEAN	Rachel Banks?

DEAN	What kind of a question is that?
BLAKE	A direct one.
DEAN	I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.

BLAKE	Why don't you just call Brill directly.
DEAN	I don't know who he is.
BLAKE	I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
DEAN	Told by whom?
BLAKE	Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
DEAN	Really?
BLAKE	Yes.
DEAN	Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.

BRILL	You knew the deal. No contact.
DEAN	Who was that other guy?
BRILL	One of many people who would live a word with you.
DEAN	Who are they?
BRILL	You've heard of the National Security Agency?
DEAN	What do they have to do with this?
BRILL	That's who they are.
DEAN	The NSA?
BRILL	Yes.
DEAN	You're crazy.
BRILL	Okay.
DEAN	Wait.
BRILL	You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
DEAN	Yeah.
BRILL	I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.

DEAN	What <u>is</u> that?
BRILL	It's a SAT-tracker.
DEAN	I don't know what that means.
BRILL	Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
DEAN	I don't know what that means.
BRILL	230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
DEAN	I don't know what that means.
BRILL	It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
DEAN	Why are they after <u>me</u>?
BRILL	If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
DEAN	Wait. What do I do?
BRILL	Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.

DEAN	Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
BRILL	They're spooks.
DEAN	I don't know what that--
BRILL	Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
DEAN	I don't know <u>anything</u>.
BRILL	No shit.
DEAN	What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
BRILL	Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
DEAN	What if--
BRILL	Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.

DEAN	What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
BRILL	And you won't. Now move--
DEAN	I'll pay you.
BRILL	They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.

DEAN	How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
BRILL	If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.

BRILL	Get dressed. We're leaving.
DEAN	You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
BRILL	Move it.

BRILL	I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
DEAN	And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
BRILL	I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
DEAN	We said a hundred.
BRILL	The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
DEAN	One-twenty.

BRILL	Did you call anyone?
DEAN	What do you mean?
BRILL	I mean did you call anyone.
DEAN	Look, my wife is understandably--
BRILL	Jesus!
DEAN	I called my wife!
BRILL	What'd I tell you?
DEAN	I didn't use my name.
BRILL	What'd I tell you?
DEAN	I called from a payphone!
BRILL	What'd I tell you?
DEAN	You told me no calls.
BRILL	I told you no calls.

DEAN	Sorry.
BRILL	You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
DEAN	I didn't use my name.
BRILL	Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!

BRILL	The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
DEAN	How do you know so much?
BRILL	None of your business.
DEAN	You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
BRILL	I was a traffic analyst.

BRILL	I intercepted phone calls.
DEAN	How'd you get around the tap orders?
BRILL	They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
DEAN	How'd you have the manpower to--
BRILL	Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
DEAN	Jesus.
BRILL	That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
DEAN	Why'd you leave?
BRILL	It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
DEAN	They come after you?
BRILL	Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.

BRILL	What do you think?
DEAN	Looks like Detroit.
BRILL	Welcome to Santa's Workshop.

BRILL	That is one ugly sunrise.
DEAN	It really is.  Did you find anything?
BRILL	Yeah.  Take a walk with me.

BRILL	Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
DEAN	Yeah.
BRILL	The NSA killed him.
DEAN	Jesus. Do you have proof?
BRILL	Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
DEAN	What's going on?
BRILL	They're here.
DEAN	Who?
BRILL	Them.
DEAN	Where?
BRILL	Here?
DEAN	<u>Here</u>?!
BRILL	In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
DEAN	'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.

BRILL	Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
DEAN	Why?

DEAN	What the fuck?!
BRILL	They shouldn't have come without calling first.

DEAN	Gimme that.
BRILL	You sure?
DEAN	You're driving.
BRILL	Those are Feds.
DEAN	I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?

BRILL	Think we let out enough air?
DEAN	Oh my God...

BRILL	We lost 'em.
DEAN	That wasn't so hard.
BRILL	Fuckin-A.
DEAN	Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
BRILL	Yeah, I can see where that'd--

BRILL	These guys are incredibly persistent.
DEAN	Tell me about it.

BRILL	Drive.
DEAN	We're not gonna hurt you.
BRILL	Drive.
DEAN	Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
BRILL	Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
DEAN	No he won't.
BRILL	Goddammit--
DEAN	We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--

BRILL	Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
DEAN	What about newspapers and magazines?
BRILL	Same thing?
DEAN	So what do we do now?
BRILL	I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
DEAN	What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
BRILL	It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?

DEAN	What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
BRILL	The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
DEAN	Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
BRILL	<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.

BRILL	What if we transmitted it over cellular?
DEAN	Listen--
BRILL	Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
DEAN	What if--
BRILL	If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
DEAN	What if--
BRILL	They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
DEAN	What if--
BRILL	What if <u>what</u>?
DEAN	What if we just fucked with 'em?
BRILL	How?
DEAN	Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
BRILL	Reynolds.
DEAN	No.
BRILL	Who?

BRILL	You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
DEAN	No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.

DEAN	We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
BRILL	How fast can you learn?

DEAN	Pretty fast.
BRILL	We'll have to re-stock some basics.

BRILL	What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
DEAN	I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
BRILL	Shit.

DEAN	What are you dialing?
BRILL	AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?

DEAN	He came in four minutes ago.
BRILL	C'mon.

BRILL	Feeling lucky?
DEAN	Not particularly, no.

BRILL	Baudmore Consultants.
PATRICK	Is Jerry Delsano in?
BRILL	Who's calling?
PATRICK	It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
BRILL	Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
PATRICK	The thing is...it really can't wait.
BRILL	My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.

SENATOR ALBERT	--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
BRILL	A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.

BRILL	Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
SENATOR ALBERT	Well then who can?
BRILL	Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
SENATOR ALBERT	What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
BRILL	The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
SENATOR ALBERT	What are you saying?
BRILL	Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
SENATOR ALBERT	Law enforcement?
BRILL	FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
SENATOR ALBERT	Are you sure about this?

BRILL	I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
SENATOR ALBERT	Oh my God.
BRILL	Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
SENATOR ALBERT	With what?
BRILL	With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
SENATOR ALBERT	Neil, thank you for your help.
BRILL	Anytime.

DYLAN	Hi, Mr. Dean.
DEAN	Hello. Hello, Maria.

DYLAN	Is it okay?
DEAN	You got any money?

DYLAN	Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
DEAN	Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
DYLAN	Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
DEAN	You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

SALES CLERK	Do you see anything you like?
DEAN	I'm married.
SALES CLERK	That's fine.
DEAN	I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
SALES CLERK	You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
DEAN	Yes. I have her permission.
SALES CLERK	It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
DEAN	Can you help me?
SALES CLERK	How 'bout Christian Dior?
DEAN	Is that good?
SALES CLERK	Very good.
DEAN	I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
SALES CLERK	It's a little late for that.
DEAN	I'll say.
SALES CLERK	What size?
DEAN	Pardon?
SALES CLERK	What size?
DEAN	Eight.  Size eight.
SALES CLERK	I'll be right back.
DEAN	Thanks.
SALES CLERK	Remain calm.
DEAN	Okay.

SALES CLERK	I think she'll like this very much.
DEAN	Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
SALES CLERK	For that matter, I think you will too.
DEAN	Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?

DEAN	I know, but--
MEG	<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
DEAN	That's my point.
MEG	<u>What's</u> your point.
DEAN	Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
MEG	Why?
DEAN	Because my life is being ruined.
MEG	Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--

DEAN	Yes?
MORELOS	I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
DEAN	Thanks.  Who are you?

MORELOS	I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
DEAN	Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
MORELOS	Your stuff?
DEAN	The robbery.
MORELOS	No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
DEAN	Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
MORELOS	Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
DEAN	A report?
MORELOS	A police report.
DEAN	That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
MORELOS	You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
DEAN	I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
MORELOS	Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
DEAN	About what?
MORELOS	About the accident.
DEAN	I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
MORELOS	Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
DEAN	What kind of trouble.
MORELOS	You tell me.
DEAN	I can't.
MORELOS	Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
DEAN	I'm not his attorney.
MORELOS	Than why can't you tell me.
DEAN	Because I don't know.
MORELOS	I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
DEAN	Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
MORELOS	Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
DEAN	Somebody took my blender.
MORELOS	We'd appreciate your cooperation.
DEAN	I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.

MORELOS	Did he give you anything?
DEAN	No.
MORELOS	Anything at all?
DEAN	No, sir.
MORELOS	Was he with anyone?
DEAN	Not that I could see.
MORELOS	Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
DEAN	No.
MORELOS	Why'd you go to Harrison's?
DEAN	To buy lingerie.
MORELOS	For your wife?
DEAN	<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
MORELOS	I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.

DEAN	I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
MORELOS	Yes sir.











STACY	Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
L183150	u5016	m333	DEAN	It's not true.
L183149	u5043	m333	STACY	Robert--
L183148	u5016	m333	DEAN	Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
L183147	u5043	m333	STACY	How could you let me find out like this?
L183146	u5016	m333	DEAN	Stacy?
L183089	u5016	m333	DEAN	There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
L183088	u5043	m333	STACY	He's got his priorities?
L183087	u5016	m333	DEAN	Well, you know--
L183086	u5043	m333	STACY	I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
L182959	u5016	m333	DEAN	It's okay.
L182958	u5043	m333	STACY	Sorry.
L182957	u5016	m333	DEAN	No.
L182956	u5043	m333	STACY	Have you been working with Rachel?
L182955	u5016	m333	DEAN	Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
L182954	u5043	m333	STACY	Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
L182953	u5016	m333	DEAN	A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
L182952	u5043	m333	STACY	Who did you work with to get the--
L182951	u5016	m333	DEAN	What do you mean?
L182950	u5043	m333	STACY	How'd you get the information on DePinto?
L182949	u5016	m333	DEAN	Yeah.
L182948	u5043	m333	STACY	Bobby?
L182912	u5016	m333	DEAN	A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
L182911	u5043	m333	STACY	What'd you buy at Harrison's?
L182910	u5016	m333	DEAN	The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
L182909	u5043	m333	STACY	I'm sorry.
L182908	u5016	m333	DEAN	In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
L182907	u5043	m333	STACY	What do you mean?
L182906	u5016	m333	DEAN	I saw a man die.
L182905	u5043	m333	STACY	What?
L182904	u5016	m333	DEAN	Something bad happened tonight.
L182903	u5043	m333	STACY	You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
L182902	u5016	m333	DEAN	I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
L182901	u5043	m333	STACY	You should take this seriously.
L182900	u5016	m333	DEAN	Right.
L182899	u5043	m333	STACY	We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
L182898	u5016	m333	DEAN	Just for the criminals.
L182897	u5043	m333	STACY	So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
L182896	u5016	m333	DEAN	Not a very good one, but--
L182895	u5043	m333	STACY	Bobby!
L182892	u5043	m333	STACY	Listen to him.
L182891	u5016	m333	DEAN	Uh-oh.
L182890	u5043	m333	STACY	This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
L182889	u5016	m333	DEAN	Hey.
L183179	u5016	m333	DEAN	Don't count on it.
L183178	u5018	m333	DESK CLERK	I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
L183177	u5016	m333	DEAN	My suitcase is gone.
L183176	u5018	m333	DESK CLERK	Sir?
L183175	u5016	m333	DEAN	My suitcase--
L183173	u5016	m333	DEAN	Here, you can use this.
L183172	u5018	m333	DESK CLERK	Maybe it's not connected yet.
L183171	u5016	m333	DEAN	It's a brand new card.
L183170	u5018	m333	DESK CLERK	I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
L182765	u5016	m333	DEAN	Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
L182764	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
L182763	u5016	m333	DEAN	That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
L182762	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
L182761	u5016	m333	DEAN	You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
L182760	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
L182759	u5016	m333	DEAN	That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
L182758	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	You don't know who the fuck--
L182757	u5016	m333	DEAN	It's not?
L182756	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	That ain't me.
L182755	u5016	m333	DEAN	I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
L182754	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	Why the hell would I--
L182753	u5016	m333	DEAN	I don't believe it is, no.
L182752	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	Is this a fuckin' joke?
L182751	u5016	m333	DEAN	Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
L182750	u5017	m333	DEPINTO	What can I do for you?
L183197	u5016	m333	DEAN	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
L183196	u5038	m333	SAL	And then what?
L183193	u5016	m333	DEAN	My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
L183192	u5038	m333	SAL	Oh.
L183191	u5016	m333	DEAN	No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
L183190	u5038	m333	SAL	You didn't squeeze DePinto?
L183189	u5016	m333	DEAN	Actually, that's not true.
L183186	u5016	m333	DEAN	I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
L183185	u5038	m333	SAL	I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
L183254	u5036	m333	RACHEL	My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
L183253	u5016	m333	DEAN	Any idea what he looks like?
L183248	u5016	m333	DEAN	Yeah.
L183247	u5036	m333	RACHEL	You're a moron, you know that?
L183246	u5016	m333	DEAN	It's not me?
L183245	u5036	m333	RACHEL	What makes you think it's you?
L183244	u5016	m333	DEAN	I'm sorry about that.
L183243	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
L183242	u5016	m333	DEAN	What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
L183241	u5036	m333	RACHEL	This conversation's over.
L183240	u5016	m333	DEAN	I <u>did</u> care how.
L183239	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
L183238	u5016	m333	DEAN	Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
L183237	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I've never met him?
L183236	u5016	m333	DEAN	You have to.
L183235	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I can't.
L183234	u5016	m333	DEAN	Tell me about Brill.
L183233	u5036	m333	RACHEL	How?
L183232	u5016	m333	DEAN	I'm gonna fix it.
L183231	u5036	m333	RACHEL	We're screwed.
L183230	u5016	m333	DEAN	Rachel--
L183229	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Bullshit.
L183228	u5016	m333	DEAN	That's temporary.
L183227	u5036	m333	RACHEL	You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
L183226	u5016	m333	DEAN	My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
L183225	u5036	m333	RACHEL	For the last four years.
L183224	u5016	m333	DEAN	You being audited?
L183223	u5036	m333	RACHEL	The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
L183222	u5016	m333	DEAN	I know.
L183218	u5016	m333	DEAN	Will you hang on just a second.
L183217	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I gotta go.
L183216	u5016	m333	DEAN	Who's doing this?
L183215	u5036	m333	RACHEL	It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
L183214	u5016	m333	DEAN	You got a minute?
L183213	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Good. You're just what I need right now.
L183096	u5016	m333	DEAN	All right, look--
L183095	u5036	m333	RACHEL	There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
L183094	u5016	m333	DEAN	Why?
L183093	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
L182749	u5016	m333	DEAN	Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
L182748	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Eat your fish.
L182747	u5016	m333	DEAN	Thank you.
L182746	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
L182745	u5016	m333	DEAN	How can I be sure.
L182744	u5036	m333	RACHEL	You're not.
L182743	u5016	m333	DEAN	I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
L182742	u5036	m333	RACHEL	He doesn't work that way.
L182741	u5016	m333	DEAN	I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
L182740	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
L182739	u5016	m333	DEAN	Why would I--
L182738	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Other than me.
L182737	u5016	m333	DEAN	Other than Brill.
L182736	u5036	m333	RACHEL	I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
L182735	u5016	m333	DEAN	Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
L182734	u5016	m333	DEAN	So you've said.
L182733	u5036	m333	RACHEL	Yes.
L182732	u5016	m333	DEAN	Brill?
L182731	u5036	m333	RACHEL	It's how he works.
L182730	u5016	m333	DEAN	Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
DEAN	I've seen it.
STACY	At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks.
DEAN	Yeah...look--

STACY	You <u>swore</u>!
DEAN	I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
STACY	I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
DEAN	I know.
STACY	You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
DEAN	I see her for business.
STACY	You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
DEAN	I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.

STACY	The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
DEAN	It's not real...  That's not me.
STACY	Oh, please--
DEAN	It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
STACY	I think you should leave now, Robert.
DEAN	Stacy--
STACY	Leave this house.

DEAN	Stacy, don't hang up.
STACY	Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
DEAN	Stacy--
STACY	I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
DEAN	I know, but listen--
STACY	Was that doctored-up, too?
DEAN	No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
STACY	I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
DEAN	I know.
STACY	I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
DEAN	It wasn't me.
STACY	This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
DEAN	Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
STACY	My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--

DEAN	Is Eric in school?
STACY	Yes.
DEAN	Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
STACY	Just reporters.
DEAN	I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
STACY	This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
DEAN	I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
STACY	What happened to your head?
DEAN	I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.

STACY	Does that hurt?
DEAN	Well...yeah.
STACY	Good.
DEAN	Stacy--

STACY	I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
DEAN	Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.

STACY	I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
DEAN	That's okay.
STACY	I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
DEAN	You opened the thing?
STACY	The lingerie.
DEAN	That was for Christmas.
STACY	I was missing you.
DEAN	You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--

DEAN	...who root through...uh...presents, and...
STACY	What is it?
DEAN	Oh Christ.

STACY	Are you sure you're safe?
DEAN	Yeah.

STACY	They're saying you killed that policeman.
DEAN	That's gonna end tonight.

STACY	Is it over?
DEAN	It's over.

STACY	It's really over?
DEAN	Albert's gonna get me my job back.
STACY	I'm sorry about Rachel.
DEAN	Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
STACY	Who?
DEAN	A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
STACY	You did good.















RACHEL	How's the trout?
DEAN	It tastes like fish.
RACHEL	It is fish.
DEAN	I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
RACHEL	Do you like fish?
DEAN	Not that much.

RACHEL	Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
DEAN	When do I get to meet him?
RACHEL	DePinto?
DEAN	Brill.
RACHEL	Never.
DEAN	That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
RACHEL	What answer were you--

















DEAN	Yeah?
PRATT	We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
DEAN	Who <u>are</u> you people?
PRATT	I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
DEAN	I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
PRATT	Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
DEAN	He didn't.
PRATT	We believe he did.
DEAN	You're wrong.
PRATT	We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
DEAN	If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
PRATT	We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
DEAN	He didn't <u>give</u> me--
PRATT	--otherwise we may have to--
DEAN	Otherwise you may have to what?
PRATT	We'd rather not--
DEAN	Fuck you. You may have to what?

DEAN	He didn't <u>give</u> me--
PRATT	--otherwise we may have to--
DEAN	Otherwise you may have to what?
PRATT	We'd rather not--
DEAN	Fuck you. You may have to--

DEAN	Jesus! What?! You want money?!
MAN	Shut the fuck up.

MAN	Your shoe.
DEAN	My shoe?
MAN	Gimme the shoe.

DEAN	Hey!
MAN	Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
DEAN	I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
MAN	Seat 74.
DEAN	You're Brill.

DEAN	God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
SILVERBERG	And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
DEAN	I have to go lingerie shopping.

DEAN	Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
SILVERBERG	Merry Christmas, son.

DEAN	Listen--
SILVERBERG	I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
DEAN	I don't under--

SILVERBERG	They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
DEAN	Oh, well, that's true.

SILVERBERG	Robert--
DEAN	Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.

SILVERBERG	What's his name?
DEAN	Brill.

SILVERBERG	Gentlemen--
DEAN	This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
SILVERBERG	Who would do that?
DEAN	Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
SILVERBERG	Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
DEAN	You're firing me.
SILVERBERG	A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
DEAN	Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
SILVERBERG	Bobby--
DEAN	Fuck off.

L.T.	Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
DEAN	Good point.
L.T.	Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
DEAN	L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
L.T.	I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
DEAN	That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
L.T.	I don't under--
DEAN	The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
L.T.	Why would the Union--

DEAN	Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
L.T.	Mr. Dean--
DEAN	My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.

JENNY	Robert--
DEAN	Where's Stacy?
JENNY	She doesn't want to talk to you.
DEAN	What are you talking--
JENNY	She can't talk to you right now.
DEAN	Why?
JENNY	Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.

DEAN	Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
ERIC	Hi, dad.

DEAN	You're learning a cruel lesson.
ERIC	Are those my Christmas presents?
DEAN	Some of 'em.
ERIC	Can I open 'em up?
DEAN	Sure, go ahead.
ERIC	Really?
DEAN	In your dreams.
ERIC	Dad!
DEAN	You staying for dinner?

ERIC	He's kidding.
DEAN	Where's mom?
ERIC	She's in the kitchen.

ERIC	Dad!
DEAN	Do I know you?
ERIC	Where've you been?
DEAN	Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
ERIC	Are you and mom getting a divorce?
DEAN	No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
ERIC	Who won the fight?
DEAN	Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
ERIC	Yeah.
DEAN	Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.

ERIC	How long can you stay?
DEAN	I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.

DEAN	It's okay to use the phone.
ERIC	Alright!
DEAN	No "900" numbers.

DEAN	They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
JERRY	Did they take your clothes?
DEAN	No.
JERRY	You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
DEAN	No.
JERRY	Usually they take clothes.
DEAN	Why don't you give 'em a call.
JERRY	What about jewelry?
DEAN	They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
JERRY	The blender?
DEAN	I love my blender.
JERRY	They didn't take the silverware?
DEAN	No, but they took my blender.
JERRY	Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
DEAN	What?
JERRY	They only took electrical appliances.
DEAN	Serve the ball.

JERRY	Can I talk to you a second?
DEAN	Table 122?
JERRY	That's what I want to talk to you about?
DEAN	I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?

JERRY	The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
DEAN	An investigation? It was a bus accident.
JERRY	He's heard that it's escalated.
DEAN	Into what?
JERRY	Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
DEAN	I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
JERRY	Just be cool.

DEAN	Jerry--
JERRY	Christ!
DEAN	Ssh!
JERRY	Bobby--
DEAN	It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
JERRY	Bobby--
DEAN	The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
JERRY	Calm down.
DEAN	They killed Rachel.
JERRY	Rachel's dead?
DEAN	Yes.
JERRY	Jesus.
DEAN	My stuff's all over her apartment.
JERRY	Bobby--
DEAN	They're framing me.
JERRY	Why would they--
DEAN	I don't know. I mean--
JERRY	Why would the NSA--
DEAN	I don't know!
JERRY	You're tired.
DEAN	Jerry--
JERRY	Listen to me.
DEAN	You gotta--
JERRY	No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
DEAN	No, I--
JERRY	You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
DEAN	I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
JERRY	To the cops?
DEAN	To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
JERRY	Bobby, you're in way over your head.
DEAN	Go to 'em, Jerry.
JERRY	I have a family.
DEAN	So do I!

JERRY	I'm sorry, man.
DEAN	No. No, it's okay.

JERRY	Bobby? Piece of advice?
DEAN	Yeah?
JERRY	Turn yourself in.
DEAN	Jerry?
JERRY	Yeah?
DEAN	Go fuck yourself.

DEAN	It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
ZAVITZ	Bobby--
DEAN	It's been a few years.
ZAVITZ	Yeah.
DEAN	I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
ZAVITZ	I need help.
DEAN	Tell me about it.
ZAVITZ	How can I reach you?
DEAN	Are you okay?
ZAVITZ	Are you still in Crystal City?
DEAN	Yeah, what's going on?

LEVIN	Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
DEAN	The police?
LEVIN	No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
DEAN	You remember Daniel Zavitz?
LEVIN	Yeah.
DEAN	He got hit by a bus.
LEVIN	What does that have to do with you?
DEAN	I honestly don't know.

LEVIN	Was Zavitz in trouble?
DEAN	I don't know.

LEVIN	You think there was a connection to--
DEAN	Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.

FRANKIE	What is it you want?
DEAN	Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.

FRANKIE	Well we'd sure like to help you.
DEAN	You would?
FRANKIE	Yes. But we can't.
DEAN	Why not?
FRANKIE	Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.

REYNOLDS	What's your opinion?
FIEDLER	It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
REYNOLDS	I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
FIEDLER	Yes sir.
REYNOLDS	Then what's your goddam opinion?
FIEDLER	Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
REYNOLDS	Get it.

REYNOLDS	I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars. Revelations II.
HAMERSLEY	What the hell does it mean?
REYNOLDS	It means who's side are you on?
HAMERSLEY	You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
REYNOLDS	It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
HAMERSLEY	Fuck you.
REYNOLDS	What?
HAMERSLEY	I said fuck you.
REYNOLDS	Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
HAMERSLEY	You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
REYNOLDS	There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
HAMERSLEY	We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.

REYNOLDS	What happened?
HICKS	He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
REYNOLDS	What about the tapes?
HICKS	We found the originals.
REYNOLDS	The originals?
HICKS	There was a transfer.
REYNOLDS	Am I to understand--
HICKS	He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
REYNOLDS	Who?
HICKS	Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
REYNOLDS	Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.

HICKS	We'd have to--
REYNOLDS	Get it.

HICKS	He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
REYNOLDS	Hiding something?
HICKS	It was in his bag. Now it's not.
REYNOLDS	Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.

REYNOLDS	30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
HICKS	He had help.
REYNOLDS	Help from whom?  Christ.

REYNOLDS	I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
HICKS	He's clever. He had help.
REYNOLDS	He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
HICKS	Sir--
REYNOLDS	No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
HICKS	I just meant--
REYNOLDS	I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--

HICKS	We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
REYNOLDS	We believe?
HICKS	Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
REYNOLDS	Lyle?!
HICKS	Yes sir.
REYNOLDS	You're kidding me.
HICKS	No sir.
REYNOLDS	Dean's with Lyle.
HICKS	And they have the video. That's confirmed.
REYNOLDS	So they know everything.
HICKS	If they've looked at the video.
REYNOLDS	Oh, let's assume that they have.
HICKS	If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
REYNOLDS	Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!

REYNOLDS	What about--
HICKS	We don't know.
REYNOLDS	Explain that.

HICKS	Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
REYNOLDS	What about the tape?
HICKS	We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
REYNOLDS	And if it wasn't?

HICKS	Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
REYNOLDS	Do you have visual?
HICKS	Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
REYNOLDS	What's your ETA?
HICKS	Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
REYNOLDS	He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.

ZAVITZ	Yes?
MAN'S VOICE	Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
ZAVITZ	Federal Express?
MAN'S VOICE	For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
ZAVITZ	How'd you get in the building?
MAN'S VOICE	The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.

SHAFFER	We're not stupid, Reynolds.
MARSHAL	The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
SHAFFER	This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
MARSHAL	You have any idea what kind of position this--
SHAFFER	He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.

MARSHAL	It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
SHAFFER	I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.

REYNOLDS	Yes?
WAITER	Puffed cheese?
REYNOLDS	No thank you.
WAITER	I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
REYNOLDS	Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
WAITER	No.
REYNOLDS	Then let's assume I don't.
WAITER	Yes sir.

REYNOLDS	Now is that clear?
WAITER	Yes sir.

CRUZ	Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
GIN	There are times when you don't answer the phone.

CRUZ	You didn't answer the beeper either.
GIN	I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
CRUZ	I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
GIN	I don't recall asking your permission.

CRUZ	A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
GIN	Through a window.
CRUZ	The windows don't open.
GIN	Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.

CRUZ	So he popped the pane?
GIN	Bingo.

CRUZ	That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
GIN	He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
CRUZ	Interesting theory. Where's the proof?

CRUZ	You ordering chop suey again?
GIN	Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.

CRUZ	Meaning--
GIN	Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.

CRUZ	And the draft blew over the flowers.
GIN	Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.

GIN	Mac's signature.
CRUZ	Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
GIN	You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
CRUZ	Exactly.

GIN	They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
CRUZ	You got a better idea?
GIN	Yeah. Me.

GIN	We've got to catch him in the act.
CRUZ	Why didn't I think of that?
GIN	It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
CRUZ	With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.

GIN	I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
CRUZ	How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
GIN	I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.

CRUZ	That's doable.
GIN	And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
CRUZ	Which you have in mind.

CRUZ	You don't call, you don't write.
GIN	This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
CRUZ	Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
GIN	We're getting close.
CRUZ	How close?
GIN	I don't know, but close.
CRUZ	This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
GIN	You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
CRUZ	Don't overestimate yourself.
GIN	Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
CRUZ	Where are you at least?
GIN	I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.

CRUZ	Gin? Where the hell are you?
GIN	I'm in the middle.
CRUZ	In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
GIN	He's on to something bigger.
CRUZ	Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
GIN	Too late now.
CRUZ	Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
GIN	I'm going to get him, I promise you.

MAC	I have a question...
GIN	Who am I?
MAC	That is of no interest.

MAC	Why are we speaking Chinese?
GIN	Uh. I'm showing off.
MAC	A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
GIN	No you can't.
MAC	I can't?
GIN	It's sold.

GIN	How about if I try humility.
MAC	How about if you try disappearing.

GIN	Mr. MacDougal.
MAC	You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.

GIN	I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
MAC	Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
GIN	I don't want to waste your time.
MAC	Then don't.
GIN	I have a proposal for you.

MAC	Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
GIN	Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...

MAC	You have a car?
GIN	Uh, yes.
MAC	Meet me in front. Five minutes.

MAC	Seems I am.
GIN	I'll call an ambulance.
MAC	It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.

GIN	You disappeared.
MAC	You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
GIN	Are you...okay?
MAC	It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
GIN	That's good. Terrific.

GIN	I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
MAC	You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.

GIN	Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
MAC	Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
GIN	Like I would have art in my suitcase.
MAC	Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
GIN	Excuse me?

GIN	I've got something...
MAC	I sincerely hope so.

GIN	You're not taking me seriously.
MAC	Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.

GIN	I didn't expect you to be so...
MAC	So what?
GIN	So alive.

MAC	Do you mind?
GIN	You...you can't.
MAC	Of course I can. I have a note from mother.

MAC	You're shaking. Are you nervous?
GIN	No. Why would I be?
MAC	Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.

GIN	I've got something for you.
MAC	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.

MAC	And I thought we were getting on so well.
GIN	We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
MAC	Not interested.

MAC	Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
GIN	Well, no...but...
MAC	Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.

MAC	For God's sake.
GIN	I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.

MAC	The Empress Death Mask.
GIN	The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.

GIN	Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
MAC	That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
GIN	I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
MAC	It's not for sale.

GIN	I know.
MAC	So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.

GIN	But Roki said--
MAC	Roki has a vivid imagination.
MAC	Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
GIN	You can't.
MAC	Oh?
GIN	It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.

GIN	We going somewhere?
MAC	Possibly.
GIN	Maybe I should drive this time.
MAC	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.

MAC	Very nice.
GIN	Not a word.

GIN	You want me to pick up a painting?
MAC	Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
GIN	I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
MAC	If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?

GIN	It's a test.
MAC	That's my girl.

GIN	Fine. What do I do?
MAC	It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.

GIN	How much am I paying?
MAC	I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.

GIN	It's a fake.
MAC	Give him the card.
GIN	But--
MAC	Can you follow simple directions?

GIN	I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
MAC	Look on the back. What do you see?

GIN	A film case.
MAC	That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.

GIN	He says they turned the card down.
MAC	Damn, I knew I forgot something.
GIN	Not funny.

GIN	What the hell do I do now?
MAC	Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.

GIN	What the hell was that?
MAC	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
GIN	You what--?

GIN	Motorcycle.
MAC	Got it.

GIN	It's one way.
MAC	We're only going one way.

GIN	We're going to die, aren't we...
MAC	I'm not the one to ask...

GIN	What about your bags?
MAC	I never carry...baggage.

GIN	Those are my clothes.
MAC	Certainly not mine. Come on.

GIN	You stole my luggage? You--
MAC	I'm a thief. Sue me.
GIN	Where's my bag?

GIN	That's entrapment.
MAC	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.

GIN	I don't believe this.
MAC	What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
GIN	What's my problem? You want a list?
MAC	You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?

MAC	Lose something?
GIN	I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
MAC	And--
GIN	I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
MAC	Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.

GIN	Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
MAC	I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

GIN	Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
MAC	My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.

MAC	You're late.
GIN	<u>I'm</u> dressed.

GIN	And good morning.
MAC	Good morning.
GIN	Nice spot.
MAC	It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.

MAC	I know it well.
GIN	As I recall, you've robbed it before.
MAC	Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
GIN	In a week.

MAC	Only a week?
GIN	They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
MAC	That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.

MAC	So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
GIN	We go underwater?

MAC	We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
GIN	We're doing this together. We're partners.
MAC	Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.

MAC	I go in alone.
GIN	You don't get the Mask code unless I go.

MAC	Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
GIN	Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
MAC	This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.

GIN	You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
MAC	A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
GIN	No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!

MAC	Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
GIN	That's because I wanted them to!
MAC	I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
GIN	I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
MAC	True enough.
GIN	You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.

MAC	The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
GIN	It was perfect.

GIN	Someone was expecting that.
MAC	You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.

GIN	I'll need that.
MAC	No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
GIN	This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.

MAC	Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
GIN	No. It's a down payment.

MAC	On what? Another job?
GIN	We get the Mask I'll tell you.
MAC	A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
GIN	Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
MAC	So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
GIN	Let's just see how we do.

MAC	So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
GIN	Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.

GIN	Why don't we take oxygen?
MAC	We are...for the tools.

GIN	Let's do it again.
MAC	Try laps. Say a hundred.

GIN	Did I hear a car?
MAC	Our equipment has arrived.
GIN	Hmmm.

GIN	All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
MAC	It was a long time ago.

GIN	I didn't mean to get personal.
MAC	Yes you did.

MAC	So how long to pop the floor?
GIN	Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
MAC	And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
GIN	A dozen times.
MAC	The lipstick thermal camera?

GIN	Got it.
MAC	Charged?
GIN	Charged. Receiver?

GIN	That's it. We're ready.
MAC	One more item--not on the check list.

MAC	I trust it's your size.
GIN	It's---beautiful.

GIN	You bought this for me?
MAC	Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.

MAC	Thank you.
GIN	Thank you.

GIN	No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
MAC	It's not a village. There's nothing there.

GIN	Won't take any time.
MAC	Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.

MAC	Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
GIN	I've got something for you.

GIN	Aren't we early?
MAC	Little celebration before we set off.

GIN	To us. To the Mask.
MAC	To our...partnership.

MAC	You're nervous again.
GIN	When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
MAC	You were afraid of heights?
GIN	Terrified. Still am.
MAC	How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
GIN	I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
MAC	Aren't we all.
GIN	My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.

GIN	He wasn't.
MAC	So you had to be your own lifeline.
GIN	Something like that.

GIN	And--
MAC	He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.

MAC	Camera in the--
GIN	Bookshelf. Sensors--
MAC	Popup, on floorboards. And--
GIN	In eye of that painting.

MAC	We're working.
GIN	It's a party.
MAC	Let's mingle a little, shall we?

GIN	One, two, three...
MAC	You're not on the beat.

GIN	Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
MAC	These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
GIN	You can't be too careful.
MAC	Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.

MAC	Ready?
GIN	Ready.

MAC	Can you see the other PIRs?
GIN	Got it.

GIN	They moved it.
MAC	Behind you.

MAC	Be careful not to break the laser beams.
GIN	Duh.

MAC	Careful...careful.
GIN	Shut up.

GIN	We did it.
MAC	The Mask.

MAC	Now's when you tell me who you really are.
GIN	What?

MAC	You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
GIN	No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.

MAC	Okay, you're a thief.
GIN	Yes. Yes.
MAC	What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.

GIN	STOP! You're making...mistake.
MAC	It's your mistake.
GIN	The big job.
MAC	There is no big job.

MAC	What?
GIN	A billion dollars.

GIN	Your share.
MAC	Get the hell in.

MAC	We're living history here.
GIN	You don't know the half of it.

GIN	I like banks.  That's where the money is.
MAC	Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?

MAC	If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
GIN	Okay, 80-20--

MAC	No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
GIN	My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
MAC	It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.

MAC	Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
GIN	Hold the record. Alone.

MAC	Hmmm...44 long.
GIN	I always knew you'd do the job.

MAC	You've got everything planned.
GIN	Everything.

GIN	I'll need the Rembrandt now.
MAC	Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
GIN	I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.

MAC	Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
GIN	Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
MAC	Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.

MAC	Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
GIN	There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.

GIN	The Mask. Where is it?
MAC	You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

GIN	Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
MAC	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?

GIN	Oh my god, I thought--
MAC	I'd taken the Mask?

MAC	What about the rules?
GIN	My job, my rules.

MAC	Well...What are we doing?
GIN	You're being useless. I'm making us rich.

GIN	Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
MAC	Transfer.
GIN	The eight billion. From them to us.
MAC	Right. The eight billion.

MAC	What's that?
GIN	Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.

GIN	Peoples China Bank.
MAC	Where the money is.

GIN	It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
MAC	And the money goes--
GIN	Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
MAC	But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
GIN	Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
MAC	A parting gift from the Empire.
GIN	Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.

GIN	The oscilloscope's already programmed.
MAC	It's no good without the argon gas.

GIN	Got it.
MAC	Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
GIN	That's where the Mask comes in.
MAC	You've thought of everything.

MAC	So how long till we do this?
GIN	We're doing it tonight.

MAC	You can't be serious.
GIN	That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
MAC	You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
GIN	There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
MAC	There's always a surprise.
GIN	I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
MAC	You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
GIN	Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
MAC	For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
GIN	Feeling old?

GIN	How do I look?
MAC	Like a woman of mystery.

GIN	Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
MAC	Can't be too careful.
GIN	Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
MAC	Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.

GIN	Pulse detectors.
MAC	Charged.
GIN	Parachute.
MAC	Packed.

MAC	Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
GIN	Surgically attached.

MAC	No way to take another day or two?
GIN	No. You'll see when we get inside.

MAC	You shouldn't have.
GIN	Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
MAC	There is one more thing.

GIN	You have something in mind?
MAC	Call it a new tradition.

MAC	That was a lifetime ago.
GIN	It was wrong to deceive you.
MAC	But that's all behind us now.

GIN	But would you--would you--
MAC	Have really held you under?

MAC	Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
GIN	Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
MAC	I'm sorry.

GIN	So what are you going to do with your share?
MAC	Oh, I don't care about the money.
GIN	Four billion dollars.
MAC	Seen one billion, seen them all.
GIN	That's because you grew up rich.
MAC	A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.

GIN	Not for me.
MAC	What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?

GIN	I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
MAC	They drive so recklessly there.
GIN	I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.

GIN	The sign of our partnership.
MAC	Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.

MAC	And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
GIN	China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
MAC	They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.

GIN	Jesus God, it's going through.
MAC	Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.

MAC	Relax, don't jam it...
GIN	FUCKING THING!!!

MAC	Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
GIN	We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!

GIN	MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
MAC	The disc is still in there.
GIN	We can't help it, we...we've gotta...

GIN	The door's the only way out!
MAC	I sincerely hope not.

GIN	Jesus.
MAC	You can do it.

MAC	Come on.
GIN	No way.
MAC	Go!

GIN	Hang on.
MAC	Get out of here!

MAC	I cannot get rid of you.
GIN	No, you can't.

MAC	Put this on!
GIN	I'm not leaving without you.

GIN	What's wrong.
MAC	Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.

MAC	Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
GIN	But--
MAC	It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
GIN	What about you?

MAC	You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
GIN	My god--

GIN	--You're a cop.
MAC	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.

GIN	He looks familiar.
MAC	That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.

MAC	They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
GIN	You gave them the eight billion.
MAC	You mean the seven billion.

QUI	A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
GIN	We need to make the trade tomorrow.
QUI	Always in a rush.
GIN	You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
QUI	Gin, really.
GIN	Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.

THIBADEAUX	I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
MAC	Next time I'll use valet parking.

THIBADEAUX	They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
MAC	Which is--
THIBADEAUX	In the van.
MAC	Tina was a wonderful woman.
THIBADEAUX	Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.

MAC	I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
THIBADEAUX	Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
MAC	And you do it so well.

MAC	The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
THIBADEAUX	Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
MAC	The key to success is using the right tools.
THIBADEAUX	You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
MAC	We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
THIBADEAUX	Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
MAC	If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
THIBADEAUX	Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
MAC	You are a miracle worker.

MAC	We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
THIBADEAUX	This is big enough.
MAC	It's never big enough.

THIBADEAUX	Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
MAC	It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.

MAC	Right.
THIBADEAUX	Because I never assume anything.
MAC	I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
THIBADEAUX	That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
MAC	Black of course.

MAC	I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
THIBADEAUX	This better be worth 1t.

MAC	Oh, it is.
THIBADEAUX	It better be worth it for me.

MAC	I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
THIBADEAUX	How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
MAC	You look like George Washington.
THIBADEAUX	I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
MAC	It's too soon.
THIBADEAUX	The early bird gets the damn worm.
MAC	But the second mouse gets the cheese.

MAC	So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
THIBADEAUX	Remind me why.
MAC	Because it pays off.

THIBADEAUX	You two make quite a couple.
MAC	We're supposed to.
THIBADEAUX	You better not be taking on a new partner.
MAC	Suspicious, after all these years?
THIBADEAUX	You change partners, you change the rules.

MAC	Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
THIBADEAUX	You damn well thought wrong.
MAC	I'm terribly sorry old man.

THIBADEAUX	Tonight your league night?
MAC	Check out my ball.

THIBADEAUX	Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
MAC	It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
THIBADEAUX	That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.

MAC	This is just show and tell.
THIBADEAUX	I'm waiting for the tell part.
MAC	She's calling the shots now.
THIBADEAUX	You're impressed with her, aren't you?
MAC	She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
THIBADEAUX	She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.

THIBADEAUX	My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
MAC	It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
THIBADEAUX	You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
MAC	You know where my loyalties lie.
THIBADEAUX	To yourself, that's where.

MAC	You'll just have to have faith.
THIBADEAUX	Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
MAC	She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.

MAC	Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
THIBADEAUX	You're giving them to me?
MAC	Call it an expression of trust.
THIBADEAUX	Thought you had to use some of these.
MAC	You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.

MAC	Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
THIBADEAUX	I figured that out.
MAC	The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
THIBADEAUX	You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
MAC	I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
THIBADEAUX	Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?

MAC	My friend, you always surprise me.
THIBADEAUX	We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...

THIBADEAUX	Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
MAC	Yes it does.
THIBADEAUX	I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.

THIBADEAUX	See you.
MAC	Probably not.
THIBADEAUX	Yeah. Probably not.

ARCHER	Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
WAXY	They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.

ARCHER	Do I look wasted -- asshole?
WAXY	You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.

ARCHER	Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
WAXY	Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
ARCHER	You mean if I get sick?
WAXY	They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --

ARCHER	What did he do?
WAXY	He hit a guard.

LAZARRO	Fine work, Jon.
ARCHER	Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
LAZARRO	I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
ARCHER	... Thanks.
LAZARRO	Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
ARCHER	Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.

ARCHER	He's lying.
LAZARRO	Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
ARCHER	I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
LAZARRO	What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?

SASHA	Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
ARCHER	Yeah -- me.

SASHA	Jesus Christ, Castor.
ARCHER	Drive.
SASHA	The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.

ARCHER	Where am I?
SASHA	My place.
ARCHER	You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
SASHA	Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.

ARCHER	I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
SASHA	Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
ARCHER	I'm not the same person you remember.

ARCHER	Perfect fit.
SASHA	Should be.  It's yours.

ARCHER	Nice-looking kid.
SASHA	Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.

SASHA	Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
ARCHER	How old is he?
SASHA	Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.

ARCHER	Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
SASHA	You're not holding him right ... Caz ...

ARCHER	And this thing can grow it?
DIETRICH	Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
ARCHER	Why would he need more?
DIETRICH	He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
ARCHER	Or reactivated the first one.
DIETRICH	Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.

ARCHER	Hey, bro ...
POLLUX	You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
ARCHER	They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...

ARCHER	Pollux ...
POLLUX	Shut up.

ARCHER	So?
POLLUX	So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?

ARCHER	What do you mean?
POLLUX	You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.

ARCHER	I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
POLLUX	Let me have a look.

ARCHER	Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
POLLUX	You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
ARCHER	I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
POLLUX	A few blanks?  Like what?
ARCHER	Like ...

ARCHER	Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
POLLUX	Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.

ARCHER	Uh -- to kill the doctors?
POLLUX	After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
ARCHER	And I bet I've kept that promise ...
POLLUX	Only one you've never broken.

ARCHER	That's not the worst part.
POLLUX	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
ARCHER	Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.

ARCHER	Thanks, Pollux.
POLLUX	For what?
ARCHER	For being one helluva guy.
POLLUX	Thanks?  I guess they really did fuck you up.

EVE	Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
ARCHER	Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
EVE	She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
ARCHER	Is that what you think?
EVE	Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
ARCHER	We need to talk.
EVE	I'm late for surgery.
ARCHER	It's important.
EVE	So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...

EVE	... I was dreaming ...
ARCHER	Something good?
EVE	We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
ARCHER	Must've been after we got engaged.
EVE	Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
ARCHER	So you had a nightmare.
EVE	Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
ARCHER	Were you there to catch me?
EVE	No.
ARCHER	How come?
EVE	I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.

ARCHER	Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
EVE	And you wouldn't be.

EVE	What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
ARCHER	One last time.  It's important ...
EVE	You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
ARCHER	I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
EVE	You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!

EVE	Is someone there?
ARCHER	Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

EVE	Who is this?
ARCHER	Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
EVE	Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
ARCHER	Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
EVE	Whoever you are, don't call again.
ARCHER	Don't hang up ...

EVE	I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
ARCHER	-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.

EVE	How did he expect to do that?
ARCHER	An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.

EVE	I took it from my fake husband.
ARCHER	Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
EVE	I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
ARCHER	What more proof do you need?
EVE	Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.

EVE	Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
ARCHER	Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --

EVE	He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
ARCHER	Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
EVE	What do you mean?
ARCHER	He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
EVE	-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.

ARCHER	You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
EVE	Jon, what is it?
ARCHER	The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
EVE	Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
ARCHER	I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
EVE	Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
ARCHER	Eve ...

ARCHER	How is he?
EVE	No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
ARCHER	That's what they always say.

EVE	I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
ARCHER	Would it?
EVE	Damn right.

ARCHER	How's Loomis?
TITO	Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
ARCHER	Go on.
TITO	Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...

TITO	We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
ARCHER	He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.

ARCHER	Which ear was it?
TITO	The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

TITO	Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
ARCHER	She doesn't know -- and she never will.
TITO	You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
ARCHER	Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
TITO	Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.

TITO	Now what?
ARCHER	Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.

TITO	This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
ARCHER	Just make sure you're there.  On time.

DR. GARDNER	How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
ARCHER	Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
DR. GARDNER	You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
ARCHER	I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
DR. GARDNER	You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?

ARCHER	One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
DR. GARDNER	I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
ARCHER	I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
DR. GARDNER	You said it, Jon, not me.

CASTOR	Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
ARCHER	And how much will your "fun" net you this time?

CASTOR	What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
ARCHER	You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
CASTOR	What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
ARCHER	Mention my family once more and you're dead.
CASTOR	You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
ARCHER	You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
CASTOR	Don't count on it.

ARCHER	-- Castor?
CASTOR	Not anymore.
ARCHER	It can't be.  It's impossible.
CASTOR	I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.

ARCHER	You killed them?
CASTOR	Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
ARCHER	What are you going to do, Castor?
CASTOR	Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --

ARCHER	What are you going to do!
CASTOR	You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."

ARCHER	Stay away from my family!
CASTOR	Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.

CASTOR	What -- what are you doing?
ARCHER	Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.

ARCHER	I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
CASTOR	Five seconds.

ARCHER	Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
CASTOR	Not if I kill you first ...

ARCHER	Jamie ...
CASTOR	Shoot him!

ARCHER	They're too tight.
WALTON	So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.

WALTON	You'll what?
ARCHER	I'm going to have you fired.

WALTON	You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
ARCHER	Pollux is -- what?
WALTON	Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
ARCHER	Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
WALTON	Or what?  You'll have me fired?

BUZZ	SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
CASTOR	Trust me, he's already here. Get going!

CASTOR	We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
BUZZ	What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
CASTOR	I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.

CASTOR	Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
BUZZ	What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
CASTOR	Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?

CASTOR	Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
JAMIE	Janie?

JAMIE	Clarissa left those here.
CASTOR	I won't tell mom if you don't.
JAMIE	When did you start smoking?
CASTOR	You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.

CASTOR	Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
JAMIE	Like you know anything about it.

CASTOR	What are you -- stupid?
JAMIE	You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
CASTOR	Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
JAMIE	You mean like ... condoms?
CASTOR	I mean like protection.

CASTOR	There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
JAMIE	Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.

KIMBERLY	Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
CASTOR	Well, I saw you -- Kim.
KIMBERLY	Kim?
CASTOR	That's your name, isn't it?
KIMBERLY	You always call me Miss Brewster.
CASTOR	Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?

KIMBERLY	You've got someone in your office.
CASTOR	Get rid of them.
KIMBERLY	The Admiral?

WANDA	You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
CASTOR	What happened?
WANDA	Castor's escaped!
CASTOR	Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.

WANDA	What happened?
CASTOR	What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!

WANDA	Commander, what are you doing here?
CASTOR	Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
WANDA	Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
CASTOR	What?
WANDA	It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
CASTOR	Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!

WANDA	You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
CASTOR	You can't blame me for trying.

POLLUX	You merciless bastard!
CASTOR	Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.

POLLUX	I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
CASTOR	You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?

CASTOR	-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
POLLUX	No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
CASTOR	Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...

POLLUX	Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
CASTOR	You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
POLLUX	Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
CASTOR	Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
POLLUX	I'm just having some fun.
CASTOR	There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.

POLLUX	Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
CASTOR	Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.

CASTOR	We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
POLLUX	Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
CASTOR	All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
POLLUX	Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...

CASTOR	You'll need to recultivate that virus.
POLLUX	No problem.

POLLUX	What about me?
CASTOR	A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
POLLUX	Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!

LAZARRO	Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
CASTOR	Normally, I would.  But today ...

CASTOR	You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
LAZARRO	You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
CASTOR	Just following your example.
LAZARRO	D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
CASTOR	What's that?
LAZARRO	Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
CASTOR	I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...

LAZARRO	You'd have to start immediately.
CASTOR	Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
LAZARRO	Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.

LAZARRO	I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
CASTOR	What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
LAZARRO	I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
CASTOR	No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
LAZARRO	Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.

EVE	What happened to your big "assignment"?
CASTOR	What do you know about it?
EVE	As much as ever.  Nothing.
CASTOR	It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
EVE	The hospital.
CASTOR	The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
EVE	Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
CASTOR	Have fun at work.

EVE	What is with you tonight?
CASTOR	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
EVE	No.

CASTOR	Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
EVE	-- I've got to study.

EVE	Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
CASTOR	They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?

EVE	I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
CASTOR	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
EVE	You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?

EVE	So -- how long will you be gone this time?
CASTOR	Gone?
EVE	Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
CASTOR	I'm not going anywhere.
EVE	You always say that -- then you leave.
CASTOR	Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --

EVE	-- what?
CASTOR	I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
EVE	... That's great.
CASTOR	So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...

EVE	You're wearing your suit --
CASTOR	Call me spontaneous.

CASTOR	What's on your mind?
EVE	Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
CASTOR	I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
EVE	The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
CASTOR	Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.

EVE	I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
CASTOR	Great.
EVE	Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
CASTOR	Oh, that Karl.
EVE	Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
CASTOR	I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...

CASTOR	What are you doing?
EVE	-- Studying.

EVE	Nothing.
CASTOR	I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
EVE	-- Yes.
CASTOR	Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.

CASTOR	Where's Jamie?
EVE	That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.

CASTOR	I'll deal with her later.
EVE	Good.  Because I'm fed up.

EVE	I'm going to the powder room.
CASTOR	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.

EVE	Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
CASTOR	Back then -- who wasn't?
EVE	Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?

MEMPHIS	How's the leg?
ATLEY JACKSON	Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?

MEMPHIS	What are you doing here?
ATLEY JACKSON	Is there someplace we can talk?

MEMPHIS	What about?
ATLEY JACKSON	About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --

ATLEY JACKSON	It's been a long time, Memphis --
MEMPHIS	Six years ...
ATLEY JACKSON	Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
MEMPHIS	Tell me about Kip -

ATLEY JACKSON	He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
MEMPHIS	What kind of job... ?
ATLEY JACKSON	A boost. A big boost ...
MEMPHIS	A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

MEMPHIS	It seems she neglected to mention it
ATLEY JACKSON	Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
MEMPHIS	Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
ATLEY JACKSON	The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.

MEMPHIS	Who was the job for?
ATLEY JACKSON	Who do you think?

ATLEY JACKSON	Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
MEMPHIS	Jesus ...
ATLEY JACKSON	The business has changed...

MEMPHIS	What's with the fish thing -- ?
ATLEY JACKSON	We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
MEMPHIS	Fish.
ATLEY JACKSON	And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
MEMPHIS	Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
ATLEY JACKSON	I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
MEMPHIS	You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
ATLEY JACKSON	I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
MEMPHIS	Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
ATLEY JACKSON	No, but you dress like an asshole ...

MEMPHIS	I think about that night a lot...
ATLEY JACKSON	Me, too. Every time I walk...
MEMPHIS	How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...

ATLEY JACKSON	Yeah -- ?
MEMPHIS	Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on

ATLEY JACKSON	Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
MEMPHIS	My version of "take this job and shove it..."
ATLEY JACKSON	Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?

ATLEY JACKSON	Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
MEMPHIS	Point-five ...

CALITRI	Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
MEMPHIS	How ya doing?

MEMPHIS	It's about my brother ... Kip...
CALITRI	Yes ... Kip ...

CALITRI	Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
MEMPHIS	I don't want him hurt...

CALITRI	My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
MEMPHIS	I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
CALITRI	Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...

MEMPHIS	I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
CALITRI	Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...

MEMPHIS	They gave you only four days?
CALITRI	They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...

MEMPHIS	I'm not interested --
CALITRI	I knew you'd say that.
MEMPHIS	I'm just here about my brother.
CALITRI	I knew you'd say that, too --

MEMPHIS	Sound it out for me.
CALITRI	Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
MEMPHIS	And if he doesn't make it -- ?

MEMPHIS	I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
CALITRI	don't want the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...

CALITRI	This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
MEMPHIS	Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
CALITRI	Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...

MEMPHIS	Get out of here, Ray --
CALITRI	One more night --
MEMPHIS	Get out --
CALITRI	I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...

CALITRI	Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
MEMPHIS	This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
CALITRI	Right there -

MEMPHIS	You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
CALITRI	But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --

MEMPHIS	Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
CALITRI	I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...

CALITRI	Well, that certainly won't do.
MEMPHIS	What do you mean -- ?
CALITRI	Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
MEMPHIS	You got no choice. It's over.
CALITRI	Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	How is he?
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	What for?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I know you --
MEMPHIS	You know my back -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	You want to come along quiet?
MEMPHIS	How's Atley -- ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
MEMPHIS	Let them go --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	How's that?
MEMPHIS	Let them go. And I'll leave ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	You'll leave -- ?
MEMPHIS	You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I don't golf...

MEMPHIS	You have my word...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Get out of here, then. Now.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I know you.
MEMPHIS	You know my back.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
MEMPHIS	A little family emergency --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
MEMPHIS	No...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Or your baby brother. What was his name?
MEMPHIS	Kip.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...

MEMPHIS	And this has what to do with me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I know you.
MEMPHIS	You know my back.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	What are you still doing here, Randall?
MEMPHIS	Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

MEMPHIS	You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Something like that -

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
MEMPHIS	I don't think so, Detective ...

MEMPHIS	I'm on the move -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Your girl works in there ...
MEMPHIS	Not my girl anymore
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
MEMPHIS	What do you want from me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I know you.
MEMPHIS	You know my back.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
MEMPHIS	Consider me gone, Detective --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	I'll catch you later, Randall --
MEMPHIS	Double-meaning intended --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	You betcha --

OTTO	Who is it -- ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Castlebeck.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	What's this -- ?
OTTO	Cadillac.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	What's wrong with it -- ?
OTTO	Needs brightening ...

OTTO	No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
OTTO	Double-meaning intended, right?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK	Right ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	When'd you get to town, Raines?
MEMPHIS	The other day....
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	What for?
MEMPHIS	No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	Where you been, anyway?
MEMPHIS	Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF	You seem a little hinked-up ...
MEMPHIS	Not at all ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	How'd it go?
FREB	Keys were in it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	Well, that defies the point, don't it?

FREB	It just ain't happening --
DONNY ASTRICKY	You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
FREB	What's that?

FREB	I guess ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
FREB	okay ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
FREB	Got it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	Good.

FREB	Diane 1.
DONNY ASTRICKY	Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
FREB	Yeah.
DONNY ASTRICKY	That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	What's the matter?
FREB	It's all microchips and shit ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	Yeah?

DONNY ASTRICKY	So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
FREB	C'mon, man ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	We're partners here --

FREB	You ever feel bad about any of this?
DONNY ASTRICKY	Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
FREB	You mean the poor --
DONNY ASTRICKY	No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!

FREB	Donny --
DONNY ASTRICKY	Donny-nothin'!

FREB	C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
DONNY ASTRICKY	Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?

DONNY ASTRICKY	Lookit Kip. All grown up...
KIP	Hey, Donny --

DONNY ASTRICKY	You guys have any skills at all?
KIP	Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	What about him?
KIP	Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business

DONNY ASTRICKY	For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
KIP	Peugot convertible ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	What color?
KIP	Gray.

KIP	No. That was Higgins ....
DONNY ASTRICKY	Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
MEMPHIS	How you doing, man?
DONNY ASTRICKY	All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
MEMPHIS	You know where the others are?

MEMPHIS	Forget that ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?

DONNY ASTRICKY	Most of 'em are late-model...
MEMPHIS	That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
DONNY ASTRICKY	We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...

DONNY ASTRICKY	Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
MEMPHIS	I know. Weird, huh -- ?

DONNY ASTRICKY	Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
MEMPHIS	And there she is --

MEMPHIS	How's it going -- ?
DONNY ASTRICKY	It's arright ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
MEMPHIS	Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...

DONNY ASTRICKY	A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
OTTO	Dignity...
DONNY ASTRICKY	Yeah...

OTTO	We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
DONNY ASTRICKY	There's no one left ...
OTTO	We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...

DONNY ASTRICKY	Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
OTTO	one minute -- !

OTTO	Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
DONNY ASTRICKY	That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?

DONNY ASTRICKY	Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
OTTO	That's a good one, Donny...
DONNY ASTRICKY	I think so too --

FREB	The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
KIP	He didn't mess up. There it is ...

FREB	How are we supposed to--
KIP	Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

FREB	Any word, Kip -- ?
KIP	No ... And they won't take my calls ...
FREB	What does that mean -- ?
KIP	It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

KIP	That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
FREB	We don't -- ?

FREB	How you know that?
KIP	Remember who my brother is?

FREB	Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
KIP	Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...

HELEN RAINES	You look good...
MEMPHIS	You, too, Ma...
HELEN RAINES	What are you doing back?
MEMPHIS	How's Kip?

HELEN RAINES	Have you seen him?
MEMPHIS	No.
HELEN RAINES	oh.
MEMPHIS	Atley Jackson came to see me ...
HELEN RAINES	Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?

MEMPHIS	Why didn't you tell me?
HELEN RAINES	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
MEMPHIS	He's in some trouble ...
HELEN RAINES	I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
MEMPHIS	You getting my checks ... ?
HELEN RAINES	Of course ...

MEMPHIS	He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
HELEN RAINES	Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself

HELEN RAINES	The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
MEMPHIS	What time of year?
HELEN RAINES	Tuesdays ...

MEMPHIS	You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
HELEN RAINES	Every day. I wonder about that every day...
MEMPHIS	Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?

HELEN RAINES	And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
MEMPHIS	Mother -- !

HELEN RAINES	I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
MEMPHIS	You remember that, Kip?

HELEN RAINES	I know...
MEMPHIS	We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all

TOBY	D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
JUDGE CROFT	I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
TOBY	Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
JUDGE CROFT	NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.

TOBY	okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...

TOBY	I know, sir ...

JUDGE CROFT	Breakfast brunch -- ?

KIP	What do you say, Toby?,
TOBY	I'm cool -

TOBY	You goin' home?
KIP	Yeah... You want a ride...
TOBY	Sure -
KIP	How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
TOBY	Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
KIP	You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
TOBY	I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
KIP	Damn crooks is everywhere --

TOBY	It looks just like a regular Mustang --
KIP	Don't go there, Toby --

KIP	Any more ...
TOBY	I dunno ...

KIP	No...
TOBY	What am I supposed to do?

TOBY	Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
KIP	Just hold on... Hold on ...

MEMPHIS	Hey, Kip ...
KIP	Hello, Memphis --

KIP	It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
MEMPHIS	You, too

MEMPHIS	Kip -- ?
KIP	Yeah ...
MEMPHIS	You all right -- ?
KIP	I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
MEMPHIS	Just hold-on there --

KIP	This has nothing to do with any of that --
MEMPHIS	Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
KIP	All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
MEMPHIS	Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...

MEMPHIS	You okay -- ?
KIP	Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
MEMPHIS	Sure --

MEMPHIS	You sure you're okay -- ?
KIP	Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

KIP	Cool. So you're living up North?
MEMPHIS	Yeah -
KIP	I heard you were pumping gas -
MEMPHIS	Something like that -
KIP	You're kind of cultivating a new look.
MEMPHIS	Yeah --

KIP	Nah. It's a scratch.
MEMPHIS	Okay --

KIP	Hey, you want something to eat ?
MEMPHIS	What do you got ... ?

MEMPHIS	There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
KIP	Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

MEMPHIS	So what are you gonna do?
KIP	About what?
MEMPHIS	About what?
KIP	About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
MEMPHIS	I can see that -

MEMPHIS	What happened to you?
KIP	What?

MEMPHIS	You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
KIP	C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
MEMPHIS	Over--  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
KIP	Hey, now -
MEMPHIS	He's gonna kill you -- !
KIP	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	You can handle it?
KIP	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	You can handle it?
KIP	I can handle it --
MEMPHIS	You?
KIP	Me.
MEMPHIS	You?
KIP	Me...

MEMPHIS	You don't think so, huh?
KIP	Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...

MEMPHIS	What are you doing here?
KIP	Otto called -

MEMPHIS	We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
KIP	I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
MEMPHIS	You hear me?
KIP	I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...

KIP	You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
MEMPHIS	Shadow games?
KIP	Shadow games ...
MEMPHIS	You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.

KIP	Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
MEMPHIS	How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
KIP	After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
MEMPHIS	Thank-you ...
KIP	De nada ...

MEMPHIS	Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
KIP	The family that steals together, deals together...
MEMPHIS	Dad'd be proud --
KIP	Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
MEMPHIS	What era was that -- ?
KIP	The era when crime didn't pay --
MEMPHIS	As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
KIP	Price of doing business...
MEMPHIS	What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
KIP	It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"

MEMPHIS	Having fun, Kip?
KIP	Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...

MEMPHIS	You okay -- ?
KIP	I'm cool.

MEMPHIS	Too early to tell. Nervous?
KIP	Nah.
MEMPHIS	That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
KIP	I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
MEMPHIS	That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...

MEMPHIS	What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
KIP	I don't know. What -- ?

MEMPHIS	Come here --
KIP	What?
MEMPHIS	Come here -
KIP	What?
MEMPHIS	Come here -

KIP	I've missed you, man ...
MEMPHIS	I know. I've missed you, too

KIP	Toby...
MEMPHIS	I know ...
KIP	Toby...

MEMPHIS	What are you doing here?
KIP	I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
MEMPHIS	Where'd you find this one?
KIP	Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
MEMPHIS	You boost her -- ?
KIP	Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
MEMPHIS	Move over ...

MEMPHIS	You okay -- ?
KIP	I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.

MEMPHIS	You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
KIP	Sure, man --
MEMPHIS	She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...

KIP	You want me to buy her?
MEMPHIS	Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like

KIP	Where you off to -- ?
MEMPHIS	Thought I'd go for a ride -

TUMBLER	Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
KIP	No problem -

KIP	But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
TUMBLER	Things are all leafy and suburban ...

KIP	Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
TUMBLER	What for -- ?
KIP	I gotta get my tool --

TUMBLER	Now what -- ?
KIP	Now, we go -

KIP	Shit ...
TUMBLER	Run it...

TUMBLER	What are we gonna do -- ?
KIP	Hospital.
TUMBLER	We can't do that, dude --

MEMPHIS	He give you an advance -- ?
MIRROR MAN	Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

MIRROR MAN	You know of one -- ?
MEMPHIS	Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

MEMPHIS	Take it back, Freb --
MIRROR MAN	Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

MEMPHIS	Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
MIRROR MAN	Where we going -- ?
MEMPHIS	We're going shopping -- !

MEMPHIS	Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
MIRROR MAN	For real?

MEMPHIS	How's it going?
MIRROR MAN	It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...

MEMPHIS	Call 911 -
MIRROR MAN	Call 'em here -- ?
MEMPHIS	DO IT! NOW -- !

MEMPHIS	See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
SWAY	What are you doing here?

SWAY	What's with the look?
MEMPHIS	The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
SWAY	You look like you lost your sheep ...

MEMPHIS	You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
SWAY	Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
MEMPHIS	Buy you a drink?
SWAY	Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.

MEMPHIS	Mitch?
SWAY	Mitch.
MEMPHIS	So I was replaced by Mitch?
SWAY	No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...

MEMPHIS	On account of Mitch?
SWAY	On account of me.

MEMPHIS	I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
SWAY	No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
MEMPHIS	I left town. I didn't leave you.
SWAY	A distinction worth noting ...
MEMPHIS	And here I am...
SWAY	Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
MEMPHIS	Kip's in trouble

SWAY	What kind of trouble -- ?
MEMPHIS	Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
SWAY	And you got some Italians -- ?
MEMPHIS	Six or seven...
SWAY	I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
MEMPHIS	I understand -

SWAY	What the hell are you doing -- ?
MEMPHIS	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...

MEMPHIS	That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
SWAY	Hey -

SWAY	Hey.
MEMPHIS	What's wrong with her -- ?
SWAY	The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...

MEMPHIS	Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
SWAY	She was the only "Annie" you could find?
MEMPHIS	They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
SWAY	Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

SWAY	She's trouble --
MEMPHIS	I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...

SWAY	I go with you --
MEMPHIS	That what you want?
SWAY	That's what I want ...
MEMPHIS	Okay.

SWAY	You mentioned that in your letters
MEMPHIS	I always thought you'd follow me up.

SWAY	We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
MEMPHIS	Very good...
SWAY	Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
MEMPHIS	No way ...
SWAY	No ... ?
MEMPHIS	No ...

SWAY	Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
MEMPHIS	Oh. Okay. Right.

MEMPHIS	Ready -- ?
SWAY	Oh, yeah.

SWAY	No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
MEMPHIS	No. Open her ...

SWAY	What the hell's that -- ?
MEMPHIS	A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...

MEMPHIS	Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
SWAY	Deodorant.

SWAY	So, you seeing anybody?
MEMPHIS	No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
SWAY	She was so great, why'd you leave her?
MEMPHIS	Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...

MEMPHIS	C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
SWAY	I think so... They're just... So ...
MEMPHIS	I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --

SWAY	Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
MEMPHIS	Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.

SWAY	Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
MEMPHIS	I take out my slim-jim...
SWAY	Oh, God...

MEMPHIS	Slip it in ...
SWAY	You're going high-cheese, dude --
MEMPHIS	Unlock your button ...
SWAY	Unlock my button ... ?
MEMPHIS	The alarms go off ...
SWAY	Woo-woo-wooooo!
MEMPHIS	I pop your hood; find your siren wires
SWAY	They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
MEMPHIS	I do ... I cut "em...
SWAY	Cut 'em...
MEMPHIS	Now... I'm in ...
SWAY	Of course you are. You're a professional...
MEMPHIS	I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
SWAY	I bet you say that to all the girls...
MEMPHIS	With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
SWAY	Wrong preposition...
MEMPHIS	Hear you roar ...
SWAY	What about The Club ... ?
MEMPHIS	Let me worry about The Club ...
SWAY	No worries ...
MEMPHIS	I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.

SWAY	You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
MEMPHIS	And Tracy's on the move ...

MEMPHIS	Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
SWAY	How is he -- ?
MEMPHIS	They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...

SWAY	Where to -- ?
MEMPHIS	Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --

SWAY	You okay -- ?
MEMPHIS	Yeah ... You -- ?

SWAY	What are you doing... ?
MEMPHIS	Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

SWAY	I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
MEMPHIS	I dunno. I know a place.

SWAY	This time it's for real?
MEMPHIS	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

MEMPHIS	What -- ?
SWAY	Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
MEMPHIS	She does have one thing you don't.
SWAY	What's that?
MEMPHIS	Bench seats.

OTTO	Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
MEMPHIS	Hello, Otto ...
OTTO	You remember Junie?
MEMPHIS	Of course. Hi, Junie --

OTTO	Whatever do you mean?
MEMPHIS	The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
OTTO	What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...

OTTO	I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
MEMPHIS	He's gotten involved --

MEMPHIS	You think it can be done?
OTTO	Are you considering a comeback tour?
MEMPHIS	Tell me...
OTTO	It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
MEMPHIS	The hard part ...
OTTO	A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them... Nietzsche said that.
MEMPHIS	Is he still working here ?
OTTO	The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
MEMPHIS	I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me

OTTO	I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
MEMPHIS	And the moral of that story is -- ?
OTTO	Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...

OTTO	Some crew you got ...
MEMPHIS	If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?

OTTO	You need him...
MEMPHIS	No we don't -
OTTO	I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
MEMPHIS	His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
OTTO	The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.

MEMPHIS	Okay, then... Otto?
OTTO	In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...

OTTO	Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
MEMPHIS	Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
OTTO	Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

MEMPHIS	Split it up. Any word on Donny?
OTTO	He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
MEMPHIS	What happened to Sway?
OTTO	She left...

OTTO	Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
MEMPHIS	I'll see you soon --

TOBY	Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
MEMPHIS	Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
TOBY	Yeah, I'm cool ...

MEMPHIS	How old are you now, Toby?
TOBY	Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...

MEMPHIS	This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
TOBY	Who's "Eleanor?"
MEMPHIS	The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
TOBY	Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
MEMPHIS	All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...

MEMPHIS	She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
TOBY	So she flies -
MEMPHIS	She soars -

TOBY	I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
MEMPHIS	So what's in there -- ?
TOBY	I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

TOBY	What about me?
MEMPHIS	You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
TOBY	How come ... ?
MEMPHIS	Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
TOBY	Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

MEMPHIS	Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
TOBY	You sure I can't go with ya?

MEMPHIS	You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
TOBY	No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?

MEMPHIS	You know what you got here?
TOM	Not really -
MEMPHIS	There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
TOM	Not really --
MEMPHIS	You have any other answers besides "not really"?
TOM	Not --
MEMPHIS	Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?

TOM	Uh ... Randall -- ?
MEMPHIS	Excuse me --

TUMBLER	What do you want, shithead?
TOBY	Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
TUMBLER	Why don't you leave him alone?
TOBY	I known Kip longing than you, man ...
TUMBLER	Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

TUMBLER	What are you doing here, assface?
TOBY	Checkin' it out

TOBY	Which way's out, man -- ?
TUMBLER	Shit all looks the same here --

TALLEY	Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
ANDERS	I think he's dead!
TALLEY	Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.

ANDERS	The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
TALLEY	That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
ANDERS	The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.

TALLEY	Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
ANDERS	Yes, sir.

ANDERS	Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
TALLEY	Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
ANDERS	I guess so.
TALLEY	Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
ANDERS	I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
TALLEY	Get to work.

TALLEY	Talley.
ANDERS' VOICE	It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?

TALLEY	What'd you find out?
ANDERS' VOICE	The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
TALLEY	Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
ANDERS' VOICE	It was stolen.

TALLEY	You get anything on Smith?
ANDERS' VOICE	Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
TALLEY	Keep trying.

BELDONE	The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
CASTELLANO	Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
BELDONE	You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.

CASTELLANO	And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
BELDONE	Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
CASTELLANO	I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
BELDONE	What do you want to do?
CASTELLANO	Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
BELDONE	The best.
CASTELLANO	Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
BELDONE	I understand.
CASTELLANO	I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
BELDONE	I'll make the call.

TUZEE	Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
BENZA	Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
TUZEE	I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.

TUZEE	You should warn them, Sonny.
BENZA	<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.

BENZA	Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
TUZEE	He knows better than that.
BENZA	Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?

BENZA	Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
TUZEE	It's happening right now.

FISCHER	Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
BENZA	You think we should take that chance?
FISCHER	I guess not.
BENZA	I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?

BENZA	What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
FISCHER	If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
BENZA	No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.

WALTER	Jen?  Are you all right?
DENNIS	She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!

WALTER	Who sent you?
DENNIS	Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

WALTER	The car.  All you want is the car?
DENNIS	Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!

DENNIS	Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
WALTER	I'm going to my desk.
DENNIS	You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!

DENNIS	<u>Get on the floor</u>!
WALTER	I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.

DENNIS	Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
WALTER	You won't die if you let me help.
DENNIS	Bullshit!
WALTER	But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
DENNIS	<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
WALTER	You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.

KEVIN	C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
DENNIS	Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?

DENNIS	Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
KEVIN	Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
DENNIS	Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
KEVIN	We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
DENNIS	Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.

KEVIN	There's fuckin' blood all over you!
DENNIS	I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!

KEVIN	That woman's gonna call the cops.
DENNIS	Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
KEVIN	What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?

DENNIS	That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
KEVIN	We're on foot.  We can't get away.
DENNIS	We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.

KEVIN	We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
DENNIS	Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
KEVIN	We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.

KEVIN	I have to tell you something --
DENNIS	We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
KEVIN	It's about Mars --

KEVIN	That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
DENNIS	Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
KEVIN	I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
DENNIS	You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --

KEVIN	Jesus.  What is this?
DENNIS	Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?

KEVIN	Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
DENNIS	Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.

KEVIN	Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
DENNIS	That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --

DENNIS	These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
KEVIN	That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
DENNIS	Not if they're looking at something else.
KEVIN	Like what?

KEVIN	We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
DENNIS	I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.

KEVIN	We're fucked.
DENNIS	We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
KEVIN	There is no way out.
DENNIS	For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
KEVIN	Celebrate what?  Going to prison?

DENNIS	If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
KEVIN	What are you talking about?
DENNIS	The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
KEVIN	That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
DENNIS	Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...

KEVIN	It's over.  We have to give up.
DENNIS	Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
KEVIN	That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!

DENNIS	Then we might as well die rich.
KEVIN	I'm not going to die for this!

DENNIS	You with the cops?
TALLEY	The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?

DENNIS	Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
TALLEY	We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?

DENNIS	We're cool.
TALLEY	Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
DENNIS	Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
TALLEY	How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
DENNIS	They're fine.

TALLEY	All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
DENNIS	You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
TALLEY	Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
DENNIS	How about the cop?
TALLEY	Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
DENNIS	Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
TALLEY	We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
DENNIS	I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!

TALLEY	It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
DENNIS	We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!

DENNIS	Talley?
TALLEY	I'm here.
DENNIS	I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
TALLEY	That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
DENNIS	I'll give you these people.
TALLEY	The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?

TALLEY	Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
DENNIS	What?
TALLEY	I gotta piss real bad.

DENNIS	You're a funny guy, Talley.
TALLEY	I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.

DENNIS	That you, Talley?
TALLEY	The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
DENNIS	You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
TALLEY	I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.

DENNIS	We been through that.  Forget it.
TALLEY	We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

TALLEY	Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
DENNIS	Okay.
TALLEY	Let me come get him.
DENNIS	Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
TALLEY	If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
DENNIS	You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
TALLEY	You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.

DENNIS	You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
TALLEY	Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.

TALLEY	You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
DENNIS	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
TALLEY	I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
DENNIS	Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?

TALLEY	You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
DENNIS	Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
TALLEY	Give up.
DENNIS	There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.

DENNIS	It ain't been a good day, Chief.
TALLEY	Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.

DENNIS	Who else is here?
JENNIFER	My father.

JENNIFER	He needs a doctor.
DENNIS	Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?

JENNIFER	My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
DENNIS	Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
JENNIFER	All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
DENNIS	Use more ice.
JENNIFER	I'm getting a doctor!

JENNIFER	What about my father?
DENNIS	Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
JENNIFER	<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
DENNIS	Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.

MARS	It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
DENNIS	Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
MARS	We're trapped in a house.

DENNIS	We can take it with us.
MARS	You can't run with suitcases.

DENNIS	That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
MARS	Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
DENNIS	Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.

DENNIS	The cops are comin'!
MARS	I got the gasoline --
DENNIS	We don't have time!

DENNIS	What the fuck is that?
MARS	They'll cut the power.

DENNIS	Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
MARS	Dennis.

DENNIS	You got something to say?
MARS	I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
DENNIS	Fuckin' A.

DENNIS	You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
MARS	I overheard him with the girl.
DENNIS	<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
MARS	I don't know.
DENNIS	Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!

TALLEY	Can you identify this man?
DILL	That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
TALLEY	Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.

TALLEY	Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
DILL	Keeps to himself, more like.
TALLEY	You have his address?
DILL	Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --

HOWELL	Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
MARION	It won't be a problem.
HOWELL	He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
MARION	Okey-doke.
HOWELL	We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.

HOWELL	Donuts here any good?
MARION	I don't eat junk food.

HOWELL	Are you out of your mind?
MARION	You fucked up, Glen.

SEYMORE	L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
HOWELL	Give me an ETA.
SEYMORE	An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.

SEYMORE	What if it goes south?
HOWELL	What do you mean?
SEYMORE	If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
HOWELL	You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.

SEYMORE	I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
HOWELL	Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
SEYMORE	<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
HOWELL	What hospital?
SEYMORE	Canyon Country.

HOWELL	How did you get this number?
TALLEY	Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
HOWELL	I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
TALLEY	I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.

HOWELL	What do you want?
TALLEY	My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
HOWELL	Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
TALLEY	I think you got no choice.

HOWELL	Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
TALLEY	Yeah.
HOWELL	You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.

HOWELL	Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
TALLEY	You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?

HOWELL	They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
TALLEY	You said they would be here!

TALLEY	You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
HOWELL	Where is it?
TALLEY	Close.

HOWELL	All right.  Now the second one.
TALLEY	First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.

TALLEY	I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
HOWELL	If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?

TALLEY	I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
HOWELL	You'd better be kidding.

TALLEY	I need to work out some stuff.
JANE	You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
TALLEY	I still see that boy's eyes.

TALLEY	Can we talk some more when you get here?
JANE	We'll see you in a couple of hours.

TALLEY	I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
JANE	Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
TALLEY	The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
JANE	But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.

TALLEY	Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
JANE	You sure?
TALLEY	I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
JANE	I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.

TALLEY	I'm scared shitless.
JANE	That's okay.  I love you anyway.

JENNIFER	Ow!  Shit!
THOMAS	Be quiet!  Listen!

JENNIFER	No one's coming.
THOMAS	That big asshole nailed my windows.
JENNIFER	Mine, too.
THOMAS	We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
JENNIFER	No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!

THOMAS	We can't carry him.
JENNIFER	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
THOMAS	I'm not gonna leave you!
JENNIFER	Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!

JENNIFER	You leave that gun alone!
THOMAS	Shh, they'll hear you!
JENNIFER	Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --

JENNIFER	He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
THOMAS	I know.

MARS	Want one?
JENNIFER	I don't drink beer.
MARS	Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
JENNIFER	What I want is to help my father.

JENNIFER	What do you want?
MARS	We can't make the microwave work.

JENNIFER	What?
MARS	We're hungry.  You're going to cook.

MARS	Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
JENNIFER	How about dog shit?

MARS	Kevin left without you.
JENNIFER	I don't know what you're talking about.

JENNIFER	You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
MARS	Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.

MARS	Now we can do whatever we want.
JENNIFER	Stop it.

JENNIFER	Please get away from me.
KEVIN	Mars?  What are you doing?

KEVIN	You gotta pee?
JENNIFER	I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
KEVIN	Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?

JENNIFER	Thanks for the shirt.
KEVIN	Whatever.
JENNIFER	Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
KEVIN	He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
JENNIFER	If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?

JENNIFER	What do you want?
KEVIN	Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.

JENNIFER	What happened?
KEVIN	Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
JENNIFER	I can't go without Thomas.
KEVIN	All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
JENNIFER	How can we get out?
KEVIN	Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
JENNIFER	Yes.

TALLEY	Are civilians inside?
JORGENSON	He said something about a girl --
TALLEY	Holster your guns!

TALLEY	We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
JORGENSON	What are we going to do about Mike?
TALLEY	Keep your head down.

JORGENSON	What's going on?
TALLEY	Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.

TALLEY	I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
KLAUS	Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.

TALLEY	Smith!  Wake up!
KLAUS	What are you doing?!  Stop that!

KLAUS	I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
TALLEY	Just one question.  Please.
KLAUS	He.  Can't.  Answer.

TALLEY	I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
KLAUS	Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
TALLEY	I need to talk to him.  Alone.

KLAUS	That's enough.
TALLEY	Another minute.  Please --

TALLEY	What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
LOUISE	Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
TALLEY	Where are they?
LOUISE	York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

TALLEY	That's not enough.
LOUISE	What's that, Chief?  Say again.
TALLEY	Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.

TALLEY	Is something wrong with Jane?
LOUISE	We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
TALLEY	It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
LOUISE	His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.

TALLEY	One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
LOUISE'S VOICE	Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

LOUISE'S VOICE	Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
TALLEY	Did he say if she was shooting at him?
LOUISE'S VOICE	He didn't say.
TALLEY	Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?

LOUISE'S VOICE	I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
TALLEY	Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
LOUISE'S VOICE	We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.

TALLEY	Louise?
LOUISE'S VOICE	Go, Chief.
TALLEY	Get a phone number for the Smiths.

TALLEY	Louise?
LOUISE'S VOICE	Go, Chief.
TALLEY	Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
LOUISE'S VOICE	I know the one.
TALLEY	Tell her I'm almost home.

LOUISE'S VOICE	Chief, base.
TALLEY	Go.
LOUISE'S VOICE	I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
TALLEY	You have her cell number?
LOUISE'S VOICE	She didn't answer.
TALLEY	They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.

TALLEY	Did you find Jane and Mandy?
LOUISE'S VOICE	Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
TALLEY	What's wrong with the radio?
LOUISE'S VOICE	Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
TALLEY	Stand by.

TALLEY	I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
MARTIN	Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --

MARTIN	Do it.
TALLEY	Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.

MARTIN	Sounds like you know the job.
TALLEY	I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
MARTIN	Maddox!  You got that?

TALLEY	Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
MARTIN	Order your men to stand down.

TALLEY	He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
MARTIN	Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
TALLEY	If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
MARTIN	Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
TALLEY	That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.

TALLEY	He says that his father's hurt.
MARTIN	If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
TALLEY	They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
MARTIN	Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
TALLEY	No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
MARTIN	Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?

TALLEY	You want me to stick around, I could --
MARTIN	You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.

MARTIN	Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
TALLEY	And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.

MARTIN	I want to know what in hell you're doing.
TALLEY	I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
MARTIN	I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
TALLEY	Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
MARTIN	-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?

TALLEY	Let it go, Captain.
MARTIN	Goddamned small town bullshit.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE	We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
TALLEY	Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
MIKKELSON'S VOICE	It's right in front of us.
TALLEY	Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE	Chief, Mikkelson.
TALLEY	Go, Mickey.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE	The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
TALLEY	Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.

TALLEY	It's mine.  Talley.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE	Chief, it's Mikkelson.
TALLEY	Go, Mickey.

TALLEY	Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE	Yes, sir.

MR. JONES	Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
TALLEY	Are all of you named Jones?
MR. JONES	Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.

MR. JONES	In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
TALLEY	You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
MR. JONES	Don't worry about what we used to be.
TALLEY	How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
MR. JONES	What's my name?
TALLEY	What?
MR. JONES	I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
TALLEY	Special Agent Jones.
MR. JONES	Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.

TALLEY	What are you people going to do?
MR. JONES	You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
TALLEY	What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?

TALLEY	We've got to get those kids out of there!
MR. JONES	Not until the man calls.
TALLEY	Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
MR. JONES	They've been in there all day.

TALLEY	The kids are in here!
MR. JONES	Where's the office?
TALLEY	Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!

TALLEY	This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
THOMAS	Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.

TALLEY	Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
THOMAS	Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
TALLEY	How about you and your sister?
THOMAS	We're okay.
TALLEY	Where are you right now?
THOMAS	In my room.

TALLEY	That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
THOMAS	They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.

TALLEY	I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
THOMAS	If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --

THOMAS	Is my daddy okay?
TALLEY	The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
THOMAS	I think so.
TALLEY	I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
THOMAS	Okay.
TALLEY	I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
THOMAS	What do you want me to do?
TALLEY	Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
THOMAS	He has lots of disks.
TALLEY	I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
THOMAS	Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.

THOMAS	But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
TALLEY	I thought they locked you in your room.
THOMAS	I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
TALLEY	Can you get into the office?
THOMAS	I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.

TALLEY	If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
THOMAS	Yes, sir.

TALLEY	Can you open them?
THOMAS	I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
TALLEY	Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?

THOMAS	I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
TALLEY	Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

THOMAS	Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
TALLEY	Who is it?
THOMAS	Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!

TALLEY	Are the disks still in your room?
THOMAS	No!  They're right here --

WALTER	Where are my children?
TALLEY	They're still in the house.

WALTER	I don't know what you're talking about.
TALLEY	He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.

WALTER	Did you find the disks?
TALLEY	Yes.
WALTER	Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
TALLEY	A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
WALTER	That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
TALLEY	How do I reach him?

THE WATCHMAN	Where's your gun?
TALLEY	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.

TALLEY	Who are you?
THE WATCHMAN	Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

THE WATCHMAN	Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
TALLEY	What do you want?
THE WATCHMAN	These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.

THE WATCHMAN	Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
TALLEY	You can let go.

TALLEY	Marlon and Al....
THE WATCHMAN	We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
TALLEY	I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
THE WATCHMAN	You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.

THE WATCHMAN	When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
TALLEY	You want . . . Marlon and Al.
THE WATCHMAN	I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
TALLEY	These disks . . . where are they?
THE WATCHMAN	Smith will know.

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
TALLEY	Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
TALLEY	I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	I guess we each have something the other wants.
TALLEY	I guess we do.
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
TALLEY	Your phony FBI assholes.
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
TALLEY	What do you mean by that?
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE	You don't want another dead child on your conscience.

AJAY	How did you know?
ROLAND	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
AJAY	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
ROLAND	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?

AJAY	I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
ROLAND	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.

AJAY	But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
ROLAND	Just a little bit too much, I think.
AJAY	How do you mean?
ROLAND	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--

ROLAND	Sorry.  We were saying?
AJAY	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
ROLAND	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.

AJAY	It matches the pictures.
ROLAND	It certainly does.

AJAY	Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
ROLAND	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --

ROLAND	You hear something?
AJAY	No.  I feel something.

MALCOLM	Any damage?
EDDIE	Minimal.
MALCOLM	Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
EDDIE	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
MALCOLM	You are an academic.
EDDIE	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
MALCOLM	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
EDDIE	It doesn't matter what I think.
MALCOLM	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?

MALCOLM	Is there an antidote?
EDDIE	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.

EDDIE	Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
MALCOLM	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.

MALCOLM	Resentful.
HAMMOND	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.

MALCOLM	I didn't know you -- weren't well.
HAMMOND	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
MALCOLM	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
HAMMOND	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.

MALCOLM	What?
HAMMOND	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
MALCOLM	What are you talking about?
HAMMOND	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
MALCOLM	I don't believe you.
HAMMOND	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
MALCOLM	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
HAMMOND	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
MALCOLM	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
HAMMOND	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
MALCOLM	So what?

HAMMOND	I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
MALCOLM	John . . .
HAMMOND	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.

MALCOLM	I'm not going, John.
HAMMOND	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --

NICK	Oh --
JUTTSON	-- my --

JUTTSON	Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
NICK	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.

JUTTSON	InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
NICK	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!

JUTTSON	But he's the head of InGen!
NICK	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?

NICK	Are you looking for a problem?
JUTTSON	Everyone, keep your voices down!

SARAH	That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
JUTTSON	I want to see the nesting ground!

JUTTSON	The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
SARAH	Not without a shot of the nest.

SARAH	Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
JUTTSON	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.

SARAH	And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
JUTTSON	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
SARAH	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
JUTTSON	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
SARAH	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --

KELLY	Hi, Dad.
MALCOLM	Kelly!  What are you doing here?

MALCOLM	Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
KELLY	I don't even know this woman.
MALCOLM	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
KELLY	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
MALCOLM	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
KELLY	My vacation is over in a week.
MALCOLM	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
KELLY	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
MALCOLM	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
KELLY	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.

MALCOLM	Is that kid still bothering you?
KELLY	Which one?
MALCOLM	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
KELLY	That was about a year ago.
MALCOLM	Well, is he?
KELLY	No.  Richard talked to his parents.
MALCOLM	That Richard.

KELLY	I could come with you.
MALCOLM	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
KELLY	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
MALCOLM	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
KELLY	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?

MALCOLM	How could you possibly?
KELLY	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

KELLY	InGen.  What's InGen?
MALCOLM	Where does it say that?
KELLY	On the side of that one truck.

KELLY	What are you guys gonna do?
MALCOLM	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.

MALCOLM	Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
KELLY	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
MALCOLM	I'm fine... I'm fine...

KELLY	Dad!
MALCOLM	Come on!

ROLAND	Cancel that, Dieter.
LUDLOW	What?  Why?

ROLAND	Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
LUDLOW	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

ROLAND	Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
LUDLOW	Okay.
ROLAND	Good lad.

LUDLOW	Where do you think you're going?!
ROLAND	To collect my fee.

LUDLOW	What kind of gun is that?
ROLAND	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
LUDLOW	How close do you have to be?
ROLAND	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
LUDLOW	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?

LUDLOW	You rally think this'll draw the parent?
ROLAND	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
LUDLOW	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
ROLAND	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
LUDLOW	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --

ROLAND	What?
LUDLOW	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-

LUDLOW	Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
ROLAND	You've broken its leg!
LUDLOW	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?

LUDLOW	What in Christ's name is going on?!
ROLAND	Isn't it obvious?

ROLAND	What is?
LUDLOW	The velociraptors.

LUDLOW	What is that?
ROLAND	Piss.

ROLAND	Where's the power and radio setup?
LUDLOW	Operations building.  Far end of the street.

LUDLOW	The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
ROLAND	Good.

LUDLOW	Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
ROLAND	Possible.

ROLAND	We took to the rock.
LUDLOW	Why?

LUDLOW	It's... behind... us.
ROLAND	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.

LUDLOW	If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
ROLAND	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

LUDLOW	So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
MALCOLM	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
LUDLOW	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
MALCOLM	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
LUDLOW	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
MALCOLM	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
LUDLOW	You version of it.
MALCOLM	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
LUDLOW	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
MALCOLM	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
LUDLOW	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.

MALCOLM	What's he got in there?
LUDLOW	Piss.

LUDLOW	Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
SARAH	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!

LUDLOW	Their what?
SARAH	Oh, God.

SARAH	What?
LUDLOW	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.

LUDLOW	You know how to work a radio, don't you?
SARAH	You're going too?
LUDLOW	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.

NICK	She's gutty.
MALCOLM	She's nuts.

MALCOLM	No way.
NICK	Oh, my God.

NICK	Do you see any family resemblance here?
MALCOLM	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.

NICK	Then this is our chance.
MALCOLM	Our chance to do what?
NICK	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.

NICK	There' no reason for name calling.
MALCOLM	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.

MALCOLM	?!
NICK	It has a broken leg!
MALCOLM	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
NICK	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!

NICK	What do they want?!
MALCOLM	What do you think they want?!

MALCOLM	No.
NICK	No way.

NICK	Lava?
MALCOLM	No.
NICK	What are they?
MALCOLM	I don't know.

NICK	Come on!
MALCOLM	Where's Kelly?
NICK	She's with Sarah!

MALCOLM	We can't stay in here!
NICK	We're sure as hell not going back out there"
MALCOLM	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
NICK	It'll hold!
MALCOLM	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-

NICK	Head for the roof!
MALCOLM	I have to find Kelly!
NICK	I think she's with Sarah!
MALCOLM	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!

MALCOLM	Something's wrong.
NICK	Look!  Sarah!

MALCOLM	No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
ROLAND	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
MALCOLM	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.

MALCOLM	You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
ROLAND	What's that?
MALCOLM	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
ROLAND	Feeling a bit blue, are we?

MALCOLM	Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
ROLAND	Why did you come here?
MALCOLM	So that others would know about this place?
ROLAND	Why should they?
MALCOLM	Because it exists.
ROLAND	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
MALCOLM	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
ROLAND	So the truth is more important to you than your life?
MALCOLM	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --

ROLAND	Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
MALCOLM	But why?
ROLAND	You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
MALCOLM	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-

ROLAND	How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
MALCOLM	Four, counting the one in the chamber.
ROLAND	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?

MALCOLM	You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
ROLAND	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.

SARAH	No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
MALCOLM	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.

MALCOLM	You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
SARAH	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?

MALCOLM	You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
SARAH	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
MALCOLM	I'm her father.

MALCOLM	No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
SARAH	Funded by whom?
MALCOLM	John Hammond.

MALCOLM	Can you set up?
SARAH	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
MALCOLM	Think fast, Sarah.

SARAH	That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
MALCOLM	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!

SARAH	Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
MALCOLM	Are you insane?!
SARAH	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --

MALCOLM	All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
SARAH	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
MALCOLM	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.

MALCOLM	Oh, God.
SARAH	What?!
MALCOLM	They're pushing us over the cliff.

SARAH	You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
MALCOLM	Maybe.  Maybe not.
SARAH	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.

SARAH	Ian.  It's guano.
MALCOLM	What?
SARAH	These formations.  They're dried --
MALCOLM	Birdshit?

SARAH	So what's your story, Nick?
NICK	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
SARAH	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
NICK	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
SARAH	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?

NICK	Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
SARAH	You think this is all a joke?
NICK	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
SARAH	Ian's a very good friend of mine.
NICK	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
SARAH	I believe in him.

SARAH	-- way we could safely --
NICK	Oh, no!

NICK	The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
SARAH	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-

NICK	Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
SARAH	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.

NICK	That little black line?
SARAH	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.

NICK	Give it more morphine!
SARAH	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --

SARAH	Hold it down, Nick!
NICK	I'm trying!

NICK	There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
SARAH	No.

SARAH	WHAT ARE YOU-
NICK	JUMP!

NICK	Where's Kelly?
SARAH	Where's Ian?

SARAH	Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
ROLAND	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --

ROLAND	If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
SARAH	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --

SARAH	We have to send someone to look for him!
ROLAND	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

SARAH	Ask her.
ROLAND	Can the kid walk?

SARAH	You've got to be kidding.
ROLAND	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.

HEYWARD	My God, you've grown up.
ALICE	We leave in the morning?!
HEYWARD	Yes, miss.
ALICE	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!

HEYWARD	Are you alright?
ALICE	Can we rest soon?
HEYWARD	Absolutely.

HEYWARD	The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
ALICE	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.

CORA	Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
HAWKEYE	Let us go, miss.
CORA	I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.

CORA	Why didn't you bury those people?
HAWKEYE	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
CORA	You knew them.

CORA	You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
HAWKEYE	Well that is to be expected. My father...
CORA	Your "father"?
HAWKEYE	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
CORA	He did?
HAWKEYE	Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
CORA	What?!
HAWKEYE	Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."

HAWKEYE	The Ottawa are gone.
CORA	Why did they turn back?

CORA	We're a breed apart and we make no sense...?
HAWKEYE	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
CORA	Thank you so much.

HAWKEYE	They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
CORA	I'm sorry.
HAWKEYE	I do not remember them. I was one or two.
CORA	How did you learn English?
HAWKEYE	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
CORA	And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
HAWKEYE	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
CORA	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
HAWKEYE	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

CORA	You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
HAWKEYE	Sorry to disappoint you...
CORA	On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...

CORA	Much further?
HAWKEYE	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

CORA	Mr Poe?
HAWKEYE	Miss.  May I?

CORA	What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
HAWKEYE	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

CORA	They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
HAWKEYE	Because what I am interested in is right here...
CORA	What would you have me do?

HAWKEYE	Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
CORA	No. I will find you.
HAWKEYE	Do not.  Promise me.

CORA	What is it?
HAWKEYE	I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.

CORA	Are we safe?
HAWKEYE	Maybe...
CORA	Our father? Did you see my father?

HAWKEYE	In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
CORA	Yes. I want you to go.

HAWKEYE	Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
CORA	...never doubt what you are doing.

HAWKEYE	And my compliments to you...
CORA	Alice?

HAWKEYE	Will you go back to England?
CORA	I have nothing to go back for.

CORA	Where will we go?
HAWKEYE	Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.

MUNRO	Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
CORA	When? How?
MUNRO	My letter...
CORA	There was none!
MUNRO	What?
CORA	There was no letter.
MUNRO	I sent three men to Webb!

MUNRO	The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
CORA	He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.

MUNRO	But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
CORA	Justice?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
MUNRO	You do not know what you are saying!
CORA	Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!

CORA	I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
HEYWARD	And by sea!
CORA	You still have an aversion to the water?
HEYWARD	Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...

CORA	Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
HEYWARD	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
CORA	Some say that's the way of it.
HEYWARD	Some?
CORA	Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
HEYWARD	Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?

HEYWARD	Will you consider that?
CORA	Yes. Yes, I will.

CORA	My God, Alice.
HEYWARD	It can be dangerous...

HEYWARD	One called Magua arrived.
CORA	He delivered no such message.

HEYWARD	Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
CORA	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.

HEYWARD	I see...
CORA	I am sorry, Duncan...

CORA	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
HEYWARD	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.

HEYWARD	He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
CORA	You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...

CORA	They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
HEYWARD	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.

CORA	Yes. Go ahead.
HEYWARD	What the bloody hell plan is this?

HEYWARD	... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
CORA	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!

HAWKEYE	Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
HEYWARD	We were headed...
HAWKEYE	...Fort William Henry.

HEYWARD	How far is it, scout?
HAWKEYE	Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
HEYWARD	Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
HAWKEYE	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
HEYWARD	What?!
HAWKEYE	Dark haired...
HEYWARD	Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
HAWKEYE	No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
HEYWARD	Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
HAWKEYE	Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
HEYWARD	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
HAWKEYE	No.
HEYWARD	Fort Edward, then?
HAWKEYE	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
HEYWARD	I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?

HAWKEYE	I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
HEYWARD	Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
HAWKEYE	England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.

HEYWARD	I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
HAWKEYE	Do not let gratitude get in the way...

HEYWARD	Who were these people?
HAWKEYE	Ottawa!
HEYWARD	Excuse me...

HAWKEYE	And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
HEYWARD	That is sedition! Treason!
HAWKEYE	That is the truth!
HEYWARD	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
HAWKEYE	Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.

HEYWARD	How long?
HAWKEYE	Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!

HAWKEYE	Head for... for the white water.
HEYWARD	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?

HEYWARD	Where do we go from here?
HAWKEYE	We don't.
HEYWARD	I don't understand!
HAWKEYE	This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
HEYWARD	Then what?
HAWKEYE	Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
HEYWARD	And if we're unlucky?
HAWKEYE	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.

HEYWARD	Any powder?
HAWKEYE	: Only one or two loads.

LIEUTENANT	It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
HAWKEYE	Your enemy...

LIEUTENANT	What did you say?
HAWKEYE	I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
LIEUTENANT	Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
HAWKEYE	First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
LIEUTENANT	Will you men help us stop the French?
HAWKEYE	... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?

HAWKEYE	You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
LIEUTENANT	You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
HAWKEYE	...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.

HAWKEYE	That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
JACK	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

HAWKEYE	So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
JACK	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
HAWKEYE	Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
JACK	We'll see in the morning...

JACK	I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
HAWKEYE	Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...

HAWKEYE	I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
JACK	You're not coming with us?

HAWKEYE	Got a reason to stay.
JACK	That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
HAWKEYE	It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.

HAWKEYE	Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
MAGUA	Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
HAWKEYE	Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.

HAWKEYE	So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
MAGUA	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.

HAWKEYE	Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
MAGUA	The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
HAWKEYE	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.

HAWKEYE	Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
MUNRO	What else?

HAWKEYE	A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
MUNRO	...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...

MUNRO	Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
HAWKEYE	It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

HAWKEYE	Many men here, their homes are in the path.
MUNRO	That's all, sir.

HAWKEYE	That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
MUNRO	What did you see, Major?

MUNRO	I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
HAWKEYE	Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
MUNRO	You forget yourself!

HEYWARD	I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
WEBB	And what is that?
HEYWARD	The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
WEBB	I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
HEYWARD	I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.

WEBB	You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
HEYWARD	Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
WEBB	Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.

WEBB	The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
HEYWARD	By your leave, sir.

MUNRO	Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
HEYWARD	Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!

MUNRO	What happened to you?
HEYWARD	Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
MUNRO	Thank you. How can I reward you?

MUNRO	What a place for them...
HEYWARD	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
MUNRO	Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.

HEYWARD	Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
MUNRO	Webb's at Edward?
HEYWARD	Yes, sir.
MUNRO	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.

HEYWARD	Things were done. Nobody was spared...
MUNRO	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

MUNRO	Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
HEYWARD	And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."

HEYWARD	This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
MUNRO	You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 

MUNRO	I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
HEYWARD	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
MUNRO	Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.

HEYWARD	Sir!
MUNRO	The decision is final.

HEYWARD	Sergeant! Form three ranks!
SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 

SERGEANT MAJOR	First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
HEYWARD	Fire!!!

HEYWARD	Advance, Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!

SERGEANT MAJOR	Shoulder arms!  Present! 
HEYWARD	Fire!!!

HEYWARD	Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!
HEYWARD	Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
SERGEANT MAJOR	Atten-hut!

HEYWARD	Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
SERGEANT MAJOR	Yes sir!

SERGEANT MAJOR	Right - about face! March! First rank present!
HEYWARD	Fire!

HEYWARD	We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
MAGUA	I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
HEYWARD	No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
MAGUA	Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness.
HEYWARD	Excuse me. What did you say?
MAGUA	Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."

HEYWARD	If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
MAGUA	Gifts?
HEYWARD	Three, four oxen... much wampum.
MAGUA	Wampum?
HEYWARD	Yes.
MAGUA	Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
HEYWARD	Yes.
MAGUA	Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.

HEYWARD	Gold could be arranged.
MAGUA	For Munro children?
HEYWARD	Yes.
MAGUA	How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
HEYWARD	The King? The King has mountains of gold!

HEYWARD	What is enough?
MAGUA	Heart. Give Magua new heart.

MUNRO	I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
JACK	Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
MUNRO	I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.

JACK	We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
MUNRO	British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
JACK	Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
MUNRO	This interview's over! The militia stays!
JACK	Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?

MONTCALM	Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
MAGUA	When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.

MAGUA	Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
MONTCALM	Yes.
MAGUA	Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
MONTCALM	My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
MAGUA	Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
MONTCALM	But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
MAGUA	Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
MONTCALM	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

MONTCALM	That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
MAGUA	And this?

MONTCALM	My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
MAGUA	Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
MONTCALM	My son Magua's pain is my pain.
MAGUA	Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
MONTCALM	Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
MAGUA	Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.

MONTCALM	Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
MUNRO	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
MONTCALM	Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
MUNRO	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
MONTCALM	You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
MUNRO	However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
MONTCALM	Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
MUNRO	Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?

MUNRO	Such as...?
MONTCALM	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
MUNRO	Their arms?
MONTCALM	They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.

MUNRO	The honors of war?
MONTCALM	Granted.
MUNRO	My colors?
MONTCALM	Carry them to England to your King with pride.
MUNRO	Allow me to consult with my officers.

MUNRO	I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
MONTCALM	Granted, Monsieur.

SENTRY	Qui vive?
MONTCALM	France.
SENTRY	Le mot d'ordre?
MONTCALM	La victoire.
SENTRY	C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
MONTCALM	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.

D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?
ANNE	I understand you saved my son's life today.
D'ARTAGNAN	God smiled upon us.
ANNE	And you were not hurt?
D'ARTAGNAN	No, M'lady.
ANNE	That is good.

ANNE	Oh God I -- Forgive me...
D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?

D'ARTAGNAN	What -- ?
ANNE	No, stay back!  Stay back!

D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
ANNE	If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
D'ARTAGNAN	I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
ANNE	Nothing... Nothing.

D'ARTAGNAN	Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
ANNE	Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN	My Queen...
ANNE	D'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN	I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
ANNE	We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.

D'ARTAGNAN	There were two.  Not one.  But two.
ANNE	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
D'ARTAGNAN	Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.

LOUIS	Mother -- ?
ANNE	May I speak with you?  Alone?
LOUIS	I am preparing for a ball!
ANNE	We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.

LOUIS	What is it, mother?
ANNE	I wish to discuss your brother.
LOUIS	He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
ANNE	First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
LOUIS	I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
ANNE	He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
LOUIS	Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
ANNE	Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
LOUIS	You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.

LOUIS	It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
ANNE	Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.

ANNE	Louis, please -- !
LOUIS	My guards are useless!  Take her from me!

LOUIS	What had you to do with this, Mother?
ANNE	He is your brother!
LOUIS	He is nothing now.

LOUIS	D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
ANNE	No, Louis!  No!
LOUIS	Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!

ARAMIS	Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
LOUIS	Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
ARAMIS	Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
LOUIS	I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
ARAMIS	How can I serve you in this?
LOUIS	Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
ARAMIS	If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
LOUIS	Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?

ARAMIS	Your Majesty...
LOUIS	How goes that favor I asked of you?
ARAMIS	I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
LOUIS	You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.

LOUIS	Wh-- Wha--
ARAMIS	Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
LOUIS	Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --

LOUIS	D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
ARAMIS	Shut up, knave!

ATHOS	And some problems cannot be settled without one.
ARAMIS	Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.

ATHOS	What do you propose to do?
ARAMIS	Replace the king.

ARAMIS	It can.  I know the way.
ATHOS	I am with you!

ATHOS	What are they doing?
ARAMIS	Making the key to the throne.

ATHOS	Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
ARAMIS	Soon enough.  Here we are.

ATHOS	The Prison of Belle Sur.
ARAMIS	Come, we have a boat waiting.

ATHOS	What is that?
ARAMIS	A body.
ATHOS	I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?

ATHOS	Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
ARAMIS	Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
ATHOS	His plight is obvious, isn't it?

ATHOS	Who is he, Aramis?
ARAMIS	Tomorrow.
ATHOS	Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
ARAMIS	You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
ATHOS	You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
ARAMIS	You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
ATHOS	He who is not with us is against us.
ARAMIS	Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
ATHOS	Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
ARAMIS	There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.

ATHOS	Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
ARAMIS	I have it all worked out.
ATHOS	Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
ARAMIS	Those can be adopted --
ATHOS	And people close to him, who --
ARAMIS	Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
ATHOS	It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
ARAMIS	Yes, and he has a choice!

ARAMIS	How is he?
ATHOS	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
ARAMIS	More wine!!
ATHOS	You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
ARAMIS	You can do it.
ATHOS	In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
ARAMIS	Three days.
ATHOS	Three days??!!
ARAMIS	The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?

ATHOS	Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
ARAMIS	You grow fond of him.  That's good.
ATHOS	Don't play God with me, Aramis I --

ARAMIS	Go on.
ATHOS	But -- what is Porthos doing?
ARAMIS	Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.

ARAMIS	Now.  You were saying?
ATHOS	But -- what is he doing?
ARAMIS	About to hang himself, I should think.

ATHOS	Hang himself?!
ARAMIS	He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
ATHOS	We must stop him!
ARAMIS	Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
ATHOS	But -- but --

ATHOS	Poor Phillippe!
ARAMIS	The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
ATHOS	All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.

ATHOS	Where are you going?!
ARAMIS	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
ATHOS	But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
ARAMIS	He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
ATHOS	What you're asking is impossible!
ARAMIS	I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
ATHOS	But --
ARAMIS	You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.

ATHOS	Aramis, this will never --
ARAMIS	Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
ATHOS	But --
ARAMIS	It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!

ARAMIS	Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
ATHOS	Hold your goblet with two fingers.

ARAMIS	Bloody hell...
ATHOS	We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.

ARAMIS	He seeks redemption.
ATHOS	You're a fool!
ARAMIS	Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
ATHOS	So what has changed?
ARAMIS	Perhaps he serves a different king.

ARAMIS	Then to the Bastille.
ATHOS	To the Bastille.  And death.

ARAMIS	A simple theological discussion.
D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
ARAMIS	Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.

ARAMIS	Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
D'ARTAGNAN	We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.

D'ARTAGNAN	No!  Stop --
ARAMIS	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
D'ARTAGNAN	You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!

ARAMIS	I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
D'ARTAGNAN	The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.

D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
ARAMIS	I know.  God go with you.

ARAMIS	Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
D'ARTAGNAN	You can't do it.
ARAMIS	Pull them back!
D'ARTAGNAN	Everyone back.
ARAMIS	Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!

D'ARTAGNAN	Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
ARAMIS	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
D'ARTAGNAN	That doesn't matter now.

ARAMIS	D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
D'ARTAGNAN	I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.

PORTHOS	Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
ARAMIS	Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
PORTHOS	I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
ARAMIS	There are more important things than tits.
PORTHOS	Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.

ARAMIS	Forgiveness.
PORTHOS	Forgiveness?

PORTHOS	I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
ARAMIS	Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!

PORTHOS	Aramis... is this the way to hell?
ARAMIS	Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

PORTHOS	Where are we?
ARAMIS	Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?

PORTHOS	Mother of God!
ARAMIS	It is also a place of burial.
PORTHOS	A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
ARAMIS	Catacombs.  Very holy.

PORTHOS	But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
ARAMIS	So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
PORTHOS	It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
ARAMIS	Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.

ARAMIS	And why are you so glum?
PORTHOS	I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.

PORTHOS	Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
ARAMIS	I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.

ARAMIS	The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
PORTHOS	I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
ARAMIS	But I was on duty...

PORTHOS	I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
ARAMIS	Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
PORTHOS	The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
ARAMIS	No, not Louis!
PORTHOS	Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
ARAMIS	I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
PORTHOS	But why?
ARAMIS	Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.

ARAMIS	You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
PORTHOS	Well... Well... Okay.

ARAMIS	Coming?
PORTHOS	What use am I?
ARAMIS	We go someplace dangerous.
PORTHOS	Why didn't you say so?

PORTHOS	Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
ARAMIS	Come on...

PORTHOS	Aramis... These are... these are whores!
ARAMIS	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
PORTHOS	Did she have tits like that?

PORTHOS	He's going to kill you, Aramis.
ARAMIS	Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.

ARAMIS	But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
PORTHOS	Who?
ARAMIS	The Queen Mother.  Anne.

PORTHOS	D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
ARAMIS	We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.

PORTHOS	Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
ARAMIS	Bread and wine... in that cupboard.

ARAMIS	D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
PORTHOS	He is right, d'Artagnan.

PORTHOS	He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
ATHOS	Who does?
PORTHOS	Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.

ATHOS	What do we do now?
PORTHOS	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.

PORTHOS	D'Artagnan, unready?
ATHOS	At a ball, everyone watches the King!

PORTHOS	Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan.
ATHOS	He lures us to capture.

PORTHOS	What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
ATHOS	You are right.  But it is a trap.
PORTHOS	So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.

PORTHOS	It worked!
ATHOS	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!

RAOUL	Do I look all right?
ATHOS	None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
RAOUL	I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
ATHOS	Perhaps this will help.

RAOUL	Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
ATHOS	She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.

ATHOS	That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
RAOUL	Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.

ATHOS	But -- are you sure?
RAOUL	We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
ATHOS	Michelle cannot possibly accept!
RAOUL	She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
ATHOS	Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
RAOUL	Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
ATHOS	Die?  What...?
RAOUL	I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
ATHOS	Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
RAOUL	It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
ATHOS	Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --

RAOUL	Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
ATHOS	Raoul --

ATHOS	D'Artagnan!
D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, my friend!

D'ARTAGNAN	It's been too long.
ATHOS	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.

D'ARTAGNAN	Thanks, but not for me.
ATHOS	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
D'ARTAGNAN	I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
ATHOS	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
D'ARTAGNAN	They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
ATHOS	Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
D'ARTAGNAN	I heard your playing.
ATHOS	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.

ATHOS	This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
D'ARTAGNAN	If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
ATHOS	She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!

ATHOS	You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
D'ARTAGNAN	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
ATHOS	What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
D'ARTAGNAN	I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
ATHOS	Raoul is everything to me.
D'ARTAGNAN	I know.
ATHOS	Oh my friend.

D'ARTAGNAN	I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
ATHOS	You trust his character more than anyone else does.
D'ARTAGNAN	Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
ATHOS	Save my son, d'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, please...!
ATHOS	Get out of my way.
D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, I beg you --

D'ARTAGNAN	Where are you going?
ATHOS	To kill the king.

D'ARTAGNAN	Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
ATHOS	The King killed my son!
D'ARTAGNAN	The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.

ATHOS	It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
D'ARTAGNAN	An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
ATHOS	Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
D'ARTAGNAN	No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.

ATHOS	If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.

ATHOS	He lies.  He is here to trap us.
D'ARTAGNAN	I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.

ATHOS	Recent hours have been a shock.
PHILLIPPE	Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
ATHOS	Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
PHILLIPPE	There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
ATHOS	The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
PHILLIPPE	What is its antidote?
ATHOS	I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.

PHILLIPPE	You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
ATHOS	It is something I have done -- or did not do.
PHILLIPPE	What is that?
ATHOS	I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.

PHILLIPPE	I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
ATHOS	I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.

PHILLIPPE	I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
ATHOS	No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
PHILLIPPE	Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
ATHOS	How did you know -- ?
PHILLIPPE	Porthos told me.

ATHOS	These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
PHILLIPPE	Whose rooms are those?
ATHOS	Your mother's.

PHILLIPPE	The room of the King's favorite mistress?
ATHOS	She will be at the ball.

ATHOS	Phillippe...?
PHILLIPPE	How did you --

ATHOS	One for all.  All for one.
PHILLIPPE	If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.

PHILLIPPE	All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
ATHOS	D'Artagnan...

ATHOS	Are you hungry?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Just... water.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK	This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
ATHOS	Who came?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
ATHOS	And you never knew why?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK	The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
ATHOS	Phillippe.  Rest now.

D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...
LOUIS	What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?

D'ARTAGNAN	The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
LOUIS	I decided it this morning.
D'ARTAGNAN	Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
LOUIS	I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
D'ARTAGNAN	But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
LOUIS	Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!

LOUIS	Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
D'ARTAGNAN	It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
LOUIS	I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
D'ARTAGNAN	Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
LOUIS	A personal nature?
D'ARTAGNAN	Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.

LOUIS	Betrothed?  I think not.
D'ARTAGNAN	In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.

LOUIS	Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty has had many women --
LOUIS	That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
D'ARTAGNAN	It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
LOUIS	What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
D'ARTAGNAN	There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
LOUIS	You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
D'ARTAGNAN	Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
LOUIS	That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
D'ARTAGNAN	At least help Raoul.
LOUIS	Silence!  I order you!
D'ARTAGNAN	Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
LOUIS	I will consider it.  Now leave me.
D'ARTAGNAN	Thank you, your Majesty.

D'ARTAGNAN	I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
LOUIS	It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --

D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
LOUIS	You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...?
LOUIS	... tired.  Must... lie down.

LOUIS	I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
D'ARTAGNAN	It shall be done, your Majesty.
LOUIS	Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
D'ARTAGNAN	Yes, your Majesty.

LOUIS	I was told this impostor was dead!
D'ARTAGNAN	... You knew you had a double?
LOUIS	He is my brother.

D'ARTAGNAN	I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
LOUIS	My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.

D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
LOUIS	Get out of my way.
D'ARTAGNAN	Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
LOUIS	Forgive?!
D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
LOUIS	They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!

LOUIS	Where is Michelle?
D'ARTAGNAN	There.

PHILLIPPE	Continue.
D'ARTAGNAN	Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
PHILLIPPE	... The ball... Continue.
D'ARTAGNAN	I must insist, Sire.

PHILLIPPE	Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
D'ARTAGNAN	No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.

D'ARTAGNAN	Phillippe!
PHILLIPPE	I am unhurt --

KEEPER	You dead yet?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	No, Keeper.

KEEPER	Food, moron.
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Thank you, Keeper.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number did you tear out?
KEEPER	Eh?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number, on the first page?
KEEPER	... Two-thirty-seven.
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."

KEEPER	You've... memorized...?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What was the end page?

LIEUTENANT	I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
LOUIS	Yes, yes, go on.
LIEUTENANT	Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.

LOUIS	Did they kill him?
LIEUTENANT	No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.

LOUIS	Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
LIEUTENANT	... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
LOUIS	You may go, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT	Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
LOUIS	Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.

LOUIS	Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
LIEUTENANT	Out directing the search for the traitors.
LOUIS	When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.

LOUIS	Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
LIEUTENANT	The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.

LIEUTENANT	Magnificent valor...
LOUIS	Shoot them!  Shoot them!

LOUIS	Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
PIERRE	Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
LOUIS	Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?

PIERRE	Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
LOUIS	Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.

LOUIS	Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
PIERRE	That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
LOUIS	Exactly why it should be given away.
PIERRE	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!

LOUIS	I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
MICHELLE	Sire, I --
LOUIS	You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?

MICHELLE	Sire!  I -- How did you --
LOUIS	How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
MICHELLE	... Nothing.
LOUIS	A letter.  May I see?

LOUIS	From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
MICHELLE	Raoul... is in love...
LOUIS	Enough of this, our dinner waits.

LOUIS	The food doesn't please you?
MICHELLE	It's lovely.  It's just...
LOUIS	This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
MICHELLE	I... we are humble people...
LOUIS	Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
MICHELLE	You would do that, your Majesty?
LOUIS	My dear, I've already done it.

LOUIS	You are beautiful.  You know you are.
MICHELLE	Sire, I --
LOUIS	If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?

MICHELLE	Shall I leave?
LOUIS	No, you may wait behind the screen.

MICHELLE	Did you know... about Raoul?
LOUIS	I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.

LOUIS	I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
MICHELLE	Oh Louis, Louis...

MICHELLE	Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
LOUIS	Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
MICHELLE	We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.

CROCKETT	Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
BARTENDER	Lemon or lime?
CROCKETT	Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
BARTENDER	Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
CROCKETT	You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?

BARTENDER	No.  I was in Namibia...
CROCKETT	Doing...?
BARTENDER	With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.

TUBBS	Yeah.
CASTILLO	What's your twenty?
TUBBS	Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
CASTILLO	Turn around.
TUBBS	We know these people...!
CASTILLO	Grieve elsewhere.

CASTILLO	About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
TUBBS	I was the kids' godfather.
CASTILLO	And...?
TUBBS	And what?
CASTILLO	I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...

TUBBS	Sal Maguda.
CASTILLO	He any good?
TUBBS	Oh, yeah...
CASTILLO	So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?

TUBBS	With Sonny.  110%.
CASTILLO	Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.

TUBBS	They'll kill Gina.
CASTILLO	They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?

TUBBS	She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
CASTILLO	There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...

CASTILLO	...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
TUBBS	Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...

CASTILLO	...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
CROCKETT	Recruit us to do what?

CROCKETT	He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
CASTILLO	Good.

CASTILLO	Okay.  What'd you spot...?
CROCKETT	Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?

CASTILLO	Yeah?
CROCKETT	José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
CASTILLO	Where's the new drop point...?
CROCKETT	They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
CASTILLO	What do you think?
CROCKETT	It's a rip and a hit.
CASTILLO	Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
CROCKETT	You can't.

CROCKETT	Just came in.  She's still alive.
CASTILLO	Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?

FUJIMA	We're not certain...
CASTILLO	You said Nazi Low-riders...?
FUJIMA	We're not certain!

FUJIMA	Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
CASTILLO	Tell them what you want.
FUJIMA	They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.

FUJIMA	You need to consider a few issues.
CASTILLO	...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
FUJIMA	Sure.
CASTILLO	I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
FUJIMA	Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...

FUJIMA	I don't know.
CASTILLO	Yes you do...
FUJIMA	I got to talk to my ADO...
CASTILLO	No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?

COLEMAN	So...?
EL TIBURON	Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
COLEMAN	All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
EL TIBURON	Okay.  You got the "item"?
COLEMAN	I got the item.
EL TIBURON	And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
COLEMAN	How many?
EL TIBURON	Two main players plus three.
COLEMAN	My end?
EL TIBURON	25% discount on the load.
COLEMAN	Make it 40%.
EL TIBURON	Make it 35.
COLEMAN	Deal.

ISABELLA	Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
CROCKETT	Really?  So, what is this, a party?

CROCKETT	I thought we had to meet the Man.
ISABELLA	You do.
CROCKETT	When?
ISABELLA	Right now.

ISABELLA	We want it back.
CROCKETT	Okay.
ISABELLA	What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?

ISABELLA	What's "nothing"?
CROCKETT	Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

CROCKETT	There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
ISABELLA	And what is that?

ISABELLA	What do you like to drink?
CROCKETT	I'm a fiend for mojitas.

ISABELLA	How fast does that go?
CROCKETT	It goes very fast.
ISABELLA	Show me...?

CROCKETT	So where's the best place for mojitas?
ISABELLA	Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
CROCKETT	Where's that?
ISABELLA	Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
CROCKETT	The Keys?
ISABELLA	Havana.
CROCKETT	Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
ISABELLA	Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.

ISABELLA	My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
CROCKETT	You do business in Cuba with your husband?
ISABELLA	I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...

CROCKETT	Were you born in Havana?
ISABELLA	Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
CROCKETT	Where's she now?
ISABELLA	She's dead...

CROCKETT	Your father?
ISABELLA	Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?

CROCKETT	How's he not your husband?
ISABELLA	I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...

CROCKETT	Mojitas...?
ISABELLA	Later!  Do you dance?
CROCKETT	I dance...

ISABELLA	Tell <u>me</u> everything.
CROCKETT	No.
ISABELLA	I insist.
CROCKETT	Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...

ISABELLA	Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
CROCKETT	Died in childbirth, having me...
ISABELLA	To mothers.  And all that we owe them...

CROCKETT	You know how improbable this is...?
ISABELLA	Probable...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
CROCKETT	...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
ISABELLA	That's right.
CROCKETT	...and therafore there is no consequence?
ISABELLA	Exactly.

ISABELLA	Like...?
CROCKETT	Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
ISABELLA	And why should continuing excellence cost more?
CROCKETT	Cost less.  That's the point.
ISABELLA	Is it December?
CROCKETT	What do you mean?
ISABELLA	Did Christmas come early this year...?
CROCKETT	Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
ISABELLA	Good samba dancing...?
CROCKETT	Zero risk.
ISABELLA	'Cause you don't lose loads?
CROCKETT	'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
ISABELLA	And you're our thirty-percent partner?

ISABELLA	The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
CROCKETT	I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
ISABELLA	Available cash is not an issue for us...
CROCKETT	Twenty-eight-point-five.
ISABELLA	What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
CROCKETT	I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
ISABELLA	Maybe I'm only one.

CROCKETT	Hola, chica.
ISABELLA	Hola, viejo.

ISABELLA	I forgot the napkins.
CROCKETT	And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
ISABELLA	What's the best fortune you ever got?
CROCKETT	They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
ISABELLA	In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."

CROCKETT	Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
ISABELLA	Why?
CROCKETT	...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
ISABELLA	Do I need it?
CROCKETT	Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
ISABELLA	'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?

CROCKETT	Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
ISABELLA	Really?
CROCKETT	Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
ISABELLA	When?
CROCKETT	Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.

ISABELLA	Would you find me...?
CROCKETT	Of course.
ISABELLA	Where would I go?
CROCKETT	Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
ISABELLA	Is this the protective male talk?
CROCKETT	This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
ISABELLA	And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
CROCKETT	A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
ISABELLA	Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...

CROCKETT	...in the morning.
ISABELLA	I'll be on board by noon.

CROCKETT	Yero, by himself?
ISABELLA	Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.

ISABELLA	If they attack you...
CROCKETT	...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.

ISABELLA	What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
CROCKETT	No.

CROCKETT	No part of it wasn't real.
ISABELLA	I know.  And now?
CROCKETT	It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.

JOSÉ YERO	José...
CROCKETT	Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
JOSÉ YERO	Sit.

CROCKETT	What...?
JOSÉ YERO	Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?

JOSÉ YERO	You afraid of violence?
CROCKETT	I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.

CROCKETT	Red light, green light, José?
JOSÉ YERO	I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...

JOSÉ YERO	Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
CROCKETT	Extras tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
JOSÉ YERO	I do.  We don't do business with him...
CROCKETT	He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
JOSÉ YERO	I'll be there.

CROCKETT	Yeah.
JOSÉ YERO	And what do I do with him?

CROCKETT	How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
JOSÉ YERO	What'd Neptune tell you?
CROCKETT	He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
JOSÉ YERO	Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

CROCKETT	Packaging?
JOSÉ YERO	Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.

CROCKETT	Yeah?
JOSÉ YERO	Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.

CROCKETT	You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
JOSÉ YERO	I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...

CROCKETT	What friend?
JOSÉ YERO	Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.

CROCKETT	Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
JOSÉ YERO	'Cause she will tell you.

CROCKETT	What's our deal?
TUBBS	Backup in case the Russians get physical.
CROCKETT	How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
TUBBS	Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...

TUBBS	And there's Dmitri...
CROCKETT	The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
TUBBS	Hello, Miss Ukraine...

TUBBS	What is it?
CROCKETT	Alonzo...
TUBBS	Stevens?
CROCKETT	Something's wrong.

CROCKETT	White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
TUBBS	White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...

TUBBS	Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
CROCKETT	Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?

TUBBS	Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
CROCKETT	It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."

TUBBS	So?
CROCKETT	We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.

TUBBS	And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
CROCKETT	That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.

TUBBS	People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
CROCKETT	No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall.
TUBBS	So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...

CROCKETT	And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
TUBBS	What kind of weight?

CROCKETT	The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
TUBBS	What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
CROCKETT	Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...

CROCKETT	Then it don't work.
TUBBS	What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?

TUBBS	Anything?
CROCKETT	Nothing.

TUBBS	Where we meeting 'em...?
CROCKETT	Port-Au-Prince.

CROCKETT	What do we got?
TUBBS	Five minutes...

TUBBS	They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
CROCKETT	Who knows...

TUBBS	To the limit.
CROCKETT	You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
TUBBS	Like...?
CROCKETT	Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
TUBBS	No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
CROCKETT	No.
TUBBS	Good.  So let's go...

TUBBS	How much we looking for?
CROCKETT	Nothing.

TUBBS	Where the hell are you, man?
CROCKETT	On my way back...

TUBBS	Where'd you go?
CROCKETT	Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
TUBBS	Where?
CROCKETT	Verdado.
TUBBS	Verdado where?
CROCKETT	It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
TUBBS	Havana, Cuba...?
CROCKETT	No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
TUBBS	...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
CROCKETT	No.
TUBBS	You're not makin' a move on her...?
CROCKETT	We're makin' moves on each other.
TUBBS	Oh, that makes it okay, then.

CROCKETT	Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
TUBBS	And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
CROCKETT	Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...

TUBBS	Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
CROCKETT	And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
TUBBS	So we want to change-up the mission statement.

CROCKETT	Hey, fuck him.
TUBBS	Chill out Sonny.
CROCKETT	We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...

TUBBS	What is going on...?!
CROCKETT	As in...?
TUBBS	There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
CROCKETT	You think I am in so deep I forgot?
TUBBS	I am asking.  You to me.
CROCKETT	Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
TUBBS	I would never doubt you.

CROCKETT	If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
TUBBS	And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?

CROCKETT	What's your take?
TUBBS	What's the point?  It's going down.
CROCKETT	Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...

TRUDY	Eleven to seven he blows it.
CROCKETT	Twenty on my man...
TRUDY	You're giving away your money, fool...

CROCKETT	Go ahead.
TRUDY	Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
CROCKETT	Switek?

TRUDY	If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
CROCKETT	Then you should.
TRUDY	If you're down, we're down for the play.

CROCKETT	Hello?
FUJIMA	This is Agent James Fujima.
CROCKETT	Detective Crockett.
FUJIMA	What's your Miami PD badge number?
CROCKETT	4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
FUJIMA	Okay.  What's up?
CROCKETT	A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
FUJIMA	How do I discuss operations over an open line?
CROCKETT	How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?

FUJIMA	Guy's involved in a "meet"...
CROCKETT	Buy and walk?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
FUJIMA	Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
CROCKETT	And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
FUJIMA	That's right.
CROCKETT	...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?

CROCKETT	OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
FUJIMA	NLR, we think.  I wanna know...

CROCKETT	How?
FUJIMA	We don't know.

CROCKETT	So what do you want?
FUJIMA	To recruit you.

FUJIMA	Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
CROCKETT	How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...

CROCKETT	From whom...?
FUJIMA	A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
CROCKETT	Never heard of him.
FUJIMA	From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.

FUJIMA	Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
CROCKETT	Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
FUJIMA	What are you talking about?
CROCKETT	Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.

FUJIMA	Out of...?
CROCKETT	Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.

FUJIMA	Control your men.
CROCKETT	I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?

GINA	This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
CROCKETT	Have faith.
GINA	I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...

GINA	Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny.
CROCKETT	Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?

GINA	You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
CROCKETT	How will it stand up?
GINA	If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...

CROCKETT	Yeah...?
STEVENS	Sonny...?
CROCKETT	Yeah.
STEVENS	Where's Riccardo?
CROCKETT	On the phone.
STEVENS	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...

STEVENS	It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
CROCKETT	Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
STEVENS	They had me from the gate.
CROCKETT	I don't understand...

STEVENS	I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
CROCKETT	Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
STEVENS	After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...

CROCKETT	Where are you?
STEVENS	...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
CROCKETT	Alonzo...!
STEVENS	Goodbye.

CROCKETT	How'd they get onto you?
STEVENS	How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!

FUJIMA	Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
TUBBS	Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
FUJIMA	White supremacist types.

TUBBS	Oh, good...
FUJIMA	...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.

TUBBS	C'mon, man!
FUJIMA	We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.

TUBBS	Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
FUJIMA	We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
TUBBS	As in, your ass is dead in the water.
FUJIMA	But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.

TUBBS	Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
FUJIMA	They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...

FUJIMA	Who are you talking to?
TUBBS	He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

TUBBS	So?
GINA	Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...

GINA	Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
TUBBS	He did volunteer one time...

GINA	What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
TUBBS	Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...

TUBBS	You okay?
GINA	Yeah.
TUBBS	You sure?
GINA	Yes.  What's up?
TUBBS	Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
GINA	Bored.

TUBBS	Okay...see you soon.
GINA	...and thanks for the flowers.
TUBBS	What flowers?
GINA	The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.

GINA	You mean with the flowers...?
TUBBS	What's it say?
GINA	Salutations from the south...

GINA	Okay.
TUBBS	Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.

GINA	...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
TUBBS	...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
GINA	...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...

ISABELLA	...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
MONTOYA	Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
ISABELLA	Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
MONTOYA	Not French registry?
ISABELLA	They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
MONTOYA	José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...

ISABELLA	Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
MONTOYA	But what does your intuition tell you...?

MONTOYA	And...?
ISABELLA	They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.

MONTOYA	Why?
ISABELLA	A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.

ISABELLA	I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
MONTOYA	What would you do...?
ISABELLA	I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....

ISABELLA	I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
TUBBS	Define small.
ISABELLA	Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.

TUBBS	And as an investment in the future...
ISABELLA	Future of...?

TUBBS	Conveyance?
ISABELLA	Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.

ISABELLA	That sonofabitch!
TUBBS	You set this up!
ISABELLA	Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.

ISABELLA	It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
TUBBS	Meaning...?
ISABELLA	They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.

TUBBS	So lay it out, my brother...
JOSÉ YERO	Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?

JOSÉ YERO	Equipment?
TUBBS	Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...

TUBBS	And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
JOSÉ YERO	Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.

JOSÉ YERO	What do you care?
TUBBS	Do we need this...?

TUBBS	Then what were we talking to you for?
JOSÉ YERO	I had to lay eyes on you.

TUBBS	What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
JOSÉ YERO	Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...

TUBBS	This the load you lost a while back?
JOSÉ YERO	It is.  He try to take tonight's load?

JOSÉ YERO	I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
TUBBS	You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...

JOSÉ YERO	Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
TUBBS	Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
JOSÉ YERO	<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...

TUBBS	Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
JOSÉ YERO	You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...

TUBBS	What the hell did you do?
STEVENS	The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...

STEVENS	I gotta, I gotta go...!
TUBBS	Alonzo...
STEVENS	What...?
TUBBS	Alonzo, you don't need to go home.

STEVENS	They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
TUBBS	They lied.

ANATOLY	Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
KASIMOV	I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.

ANATOLY	C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
KASIMOV	They'll kill me.

ANATOLY	You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
KASIMOV	You're right, of course.

ANATOLY	Come on!
KASIMOV	His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
ANATOLY	Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...

ANATOLY	To friends.
KASIMOV	Yes, Anatoly, yes.

KITTRIDGE	The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
BARNES	Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
KITTRIDGE	What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
BARNES	So what do you suggest?
KITTRIDGE	Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.

BARNES	That's S.O.P..
KITTRIDGE	S.O.P..

KITTRIDGE	<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
BARNES	Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
KITTRIDGE	Okay!

KITTRIDGE	You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
BARNES	What about him...?

BARNES	Only four more cars.
KITTRIDGE	And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
BARNES	Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
KITTRIDGE	High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
BARNES	But why tell us?
KITTRIDGE	Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
BARNES	What kind of show.
KITTRIDGE	I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.

BARNES	Nothing but civilians, Gene.
KITTRIDGE	This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
BARNES	Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
KITTRIDGE	Good idea.

CLAIRE	You knew about Jim?
PHELPS	Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?

PHELPS	Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
CLAIRE	Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
PHELPS	Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.

PHELPS	Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
CLAIRE	Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.

PHELPS	Satisfied?
CLAIRE	All ten million.
PHELPS	Fold it.  Fold it tight.

CLAIRE	Donít Jim.
PHELPS	Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
CLAIRE	Yes.

KRIEGER	Is he serious?
CLAIRE	Always.
KRIEGER	If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.

CLAIRE	Krieger can get it.  Right?
KRIEGER	May take a little time.

KRIEGER	I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
CLAIRE	Krieger.
KRIEGER	Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue

CLAIRE	Did we get it?
ETHAN	We got it.  On your feet.
CLAIRE	I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
ETHAN	Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
CLAIRE	I'm walking.
ETHAN	Talking's good, walking's better.
CLAIRE	Sleeping's better.

CLAIRE	Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
ETHAN	If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
CLAIRE	Oh yeah?

ETHAN	Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
CLAIRE	Roger that.

CLAIRE	Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
ETHAN	Don't move.

ETHAN	You were in the car!
CLAIRE	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
ETHAN	Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
CLAIRE	No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
ETHAN	Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
CLAIRE	What happened to Jim?
ETHAN	There was nobody on the bridge.
CLAIRE	What happened to Jim?

CLAIRE	They're dead.  Jim's dead.
ETHAN	Take off your coat.
CLAIRE	What?
ETHAN	Take off your God damn coat!

ETHAN	Where were you?
CLAIRE	I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
ETHAN	That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
CLAIRE	Who is "they?"
ETHAN	Did they send you...Did they send you?
CLAIRE	Who is they, who is they?

ETHAN	Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
CLAIRE	No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!

CLAIRE	Why haven't they brought us in yet?
ETHAN	I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.

CLAIRE	What are you going to do?
ETHAN	I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
CLAIRE	Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
ETHAN	Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.

CLAIRE	The message is for Job.
ETHAN	I'm going to answer it.

CLAIRE	Max made a deal with you?
ETHAN	I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
CLAIRE	We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
ETHAN	You're sure about this?
CLAIRE	Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
ETHAN	We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
CLAIRE	What kind of help?

ETHAN	May I come in?
CLAIRE	Sure...

ETHAN	It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
CLAIRE	You don't think we're going to make it.
ETHAN	I didn't say that.
CLAIRE	You didn't have to.........
ETHAN	I just need you to be safe.
CLAIRE	What about you?
ETHAN	What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.

CLAIRE	I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
ETHAN	We did what we had to do.
CLAIRE	I'm going to try and get some sleep.

ETHAN	Kittridge...
CLAIRE	Bastard!

CLAIRE	What are you going to do?
ETHAN	He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.

CLAIRE	What happened?
ETHAN	I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
CLAIRE	Okay...
ETHAN	Is this the only way?
CLAIRE	Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

CLAIRE	Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
ETHAN	Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
CLAIRE	Two cars.  Where are you?
ETHAN	You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

CLAIRE	Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
ETHAN	Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
CLAIRE	Ethan?

ETHAN	Claire...Hey...
CLAIRE	This stuff is so sticky.
ETHAN	Claire.
CLAIRE	Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
ETHAN	I always have, Claire..

KITTRIDGE	This is Kittridge.
ETHAN	Go secure.

KITTRIDGE	Go ahead.
ETHAN	Theyíre dead.
KITTRIDGE	Whoís dead?
ETHAN	My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
KITTRIDGE	Are you damaged?
ETHAN	They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
KITTRIDGE	<u>Are you intact</u>?
ETHAN	Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
KITTRIDGE	Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?

ETHAN	I donít think so.
KITTRIDGE	Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
ETHAN	Yes.
KITTRIDGE	Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
ETHAN	Youíre in Prague?
KITTRIDGE	Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
ETHAN	No sir.
KITTRIDGE	One hour.

KITTRIDGE	I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
ETHAN	Yeah.

KITTRIDGE	Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
ETHAN	Yeah.  I follow you.
KITTRIDGE	We've lost enough agents for one night.
ETHAN	You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.

KITTRIDGE	You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
ETHAN	Who else is left?
KITTRIDGE	Yes.  I see your point.
ETHAN	Why was there another team?
KITTRIDGE	What?
ETHAN	Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
KITTRIDGE	I don't quite follow you.
ETHAN	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
KITTRIDGE	You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.

KITTRIDGE	For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
ETHAN	The arms dealer.
KITTRIDGE	That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
ETHAN	But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
KITTRIDGE	Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
ETHAN	This whole operation was a molehunt.
KITTRIDGE	Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.

KITTRIDGE	Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
ETHAN	How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
KITTRIDGE	Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
ETHAN	Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.

KITTRIDGE	Kittridge.
ETHAN	I see you've been out visiting the folks.
KITTRIDGE	It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?

ETHAN	Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
KITTRIDGE	Certainly Ethan.
ETHAN	If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
KITTRIDGE	I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?

LUTHER	What are we downloading?
ETHAN	Information.
LUTHER	What kind?
ETHAN	Profitable.

ETHAN	This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
LUTHER	There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
ETHAN	You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
LUTHER	You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --

ETHAN	May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
LUTHER	Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --

LUTHER	And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
ETHAN	Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
LUTHER	I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
ETHAN	Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.

LUTHER	Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
ETHAN	Now I want you to hold onto it.
LUTHER	What makes you trust me?
ETHAN	Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
LUTHER	I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
ETHAN	Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
LUTHER	It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
ETHAN	I'll get you close.

LUTHER	Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
ETHAN	About what?
LUTHER	The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
ETHAN	Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.

ETHAN	Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
LUTHER	Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
ETHAN	You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
LUTHER	Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
ETHAN	You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
LUTHER	I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
ETHAN	It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
LUTHER	Why don't you come back with me?
ETHAN	Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
LUTHER	You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
ETHAN	He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
LUTHER	Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
ETHAN	Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.

MAX	Who are you and what are you doing here?
ETHAN	I need one hundred thousand dollars.
MAX	Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
ETHAN	Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
MAX	The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
ETHAN	That depends.
MAX	On what?
ETHAN	Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
MAX	It's quite out of the question.
ETHAN	The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
MAX	And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
ETHAN	Like Job?
MAX	Ah, but, we're asking about you.
ETHAN	I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
MAX	Why, may I ask?
ETHAN	That's the question I want to ask Job.
MAX	I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
ETHAN	Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
MAX	Why should I?
ETHAN	Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
MAX	It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
ETHAN	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
MAX	Mm - Hmmm...
ETHAN	Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
MAX	Very good.
ETHAN	Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.

ETHAN	Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
MAX	I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
ETHAN	What was your deal with Job?
MAX	Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
ETHAN	<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
MAX	Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
ETHAN	How will you make sure Job will be there?
MAX	How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
ETHAN	I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.

MAX	I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
ETHAN	I wouldn't dream of it.

MAX	Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
ETHAN	It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
MAX	The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
ETHAN	What about Job?
MAX	I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.

ETHAN	What sector's the air conditioning?
GUARD RANDALL	Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
ETHAN	I gotta go in there and shut it down!
GUARD RANDALL	Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
ETHAN	Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?

GUARD RANDALL	Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
ETHAN	Let's move!

ETHAN	Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
KRIEGER	Bank?
ETHAN	IMF mainframe.
KRIEGER	Where exactly is it?
ETHAN	In Langley.

ETHAN	Zero body count.
KRIEGER	We'll see.
ETHAN	Time up.

KRIEGER	Merci.
ETHAN	We're not outta here yet.

KRIEGER	You're not going to any meeting without me.
ETHAN	My contact is extremely shy.

KRIEGER	That's not it.  That's not the list.
ETHAN	What's the matter, you don't know this trick?

JACK	Claire.
ETHAN	Jack.

ETHAN	IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
JACK	Just waiting for you, tubs.

JACK	Sorry, am I interrupting?
ETHAN	Always.

ETHAN	Give me the God damn gum.
JACK	Just don't chew it.

ETHAN	Jack.  Jack.
JACK	I didn't touch it.

ETHAN	He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
JACK	Give me a break, Pops.

ETHAN	In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
JACK	Roger that.  Opening doors now.
ETHAN	Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.

ETHAN	Higher.  Higher.
SARAH	Higher.
ETHAN	Right, right.  Good.

ETHAN	OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
SARAH	What about my coat?  I'll freeze.

SARAH	The package is in the open.
ETHAN	Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.

SARAH	Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
ETHAN	Jim we canít.

ETHAN	Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
SARAH	Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
ETHAN	No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!

MATTHIAS	Would you remove your hat please?
ETHAN	Why?
MATTHIAS	You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.

ETHAN	I thought I was going to see Max.
MATTHIAS	You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
ETHAN	Then what am I doing here?
MATTHIAS	Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
ETHAN	I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
MATTHIAS	If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
ETHAN	I'm willing to take the chance.
MATTHIAS	Very well.

MATTHIAS	Forty-four.  Forty-five.
ETHAN	I'd say you've got about two minutes.

ETHAN	Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
PHELPS	A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
ETHAN	I thought I'd take some now.
PHELPS	What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
ETHAN	Oh?  What's the problem?
PHELPS	I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
ETHAN	Tell you what?
PHELPS	When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
ETHAN	What problem?
PHELPS	Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
ETHAN	I guess.
PHELPS	Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
ETHAN	Why not?
PHELPS	Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.

ETHAN	How was Chicago?
PHELPS	Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"

ETHAN	You're going to use Walter?
PHELPS	He's our guy.
ETHAN	Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
PHELPS	Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
ETHAN	He won't be back in a hurry?
PHELPS	No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
ETHAN	Sure.  If the main character does.
PHELPS	If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?

PHELPS	Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
ETHAN	We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.

PHELPS	Iíve got a shadow.
ETHAN	Can you lose him?
PHELPS	No.  Abort.

PHELPS	Abort.  Thatís an order.
ETHAN	<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.

PHELPS	Where are you?
ETHAN	About two hundred yards from the bridge.
PHELPS	Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.

PHELPS	..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
ETHAN	- and picked us up in the States -
PHELPS	- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
ETHAN	Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
PHELPS	- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
ETHAN	You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
PHELPS	Hey, I showed 'em to you!
ETHAN	I remember..

ETHAN	Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
PHELPS	I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>

ETHAN	Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
PHELPS	Yeah.
ETHAN	How did Kittridge do it?..

PHELPS	..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
ETHAN	We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
PHELPS	Whatís going to make him do that?
ETHAN	What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
PHELPS	Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
ETHAN	A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
PHELPS	Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
ETHAN	If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

ETHAN	Jim...?
PHELPS	I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..

PHELPS	- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
ETHAN	Youíre probably right.
PHELPS	I usually am.
ETHAN	Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
PHELPS	You got it.
ETHAN	And get a doctor.
PHELPS	Good luck.

ETHAN	Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
PHELPS	They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.

ETHAN	I knew about Jim.
PHELPS	But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"

ETHAN	Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
PHELPS	Keep counting Claire.

ETHAN	Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
PHELPS	Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.

PHELPS	Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
ETHAN	Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.

ETHAN	Jim, itís over.
PHELPS	Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.

JACK	Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
SARAH	Of course I can hear you.
JACK	No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
SARAH	Loud and clear.
JACK	What's going on?
SARAH	I don't know.
JACK	Why don't you take a look?
SARAH	Jack...that's spying.
JACK	That's what we do isn't it?
SARAH	Jack you're so wicked.
JACK	Too wicked to have a drink later?
SARAH	I think I might just take that look.

SARAH	Such a nice ass.
JACK	And a lonely ass.

MATTHIAS	Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
MAX	That's not so good for you, my friend.

MATTHIAS	Thirty-two and change.
MAX	Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

MAX	How long until we reach the Chunnel?
MATTHIAS	Twenty minutes.

MATTHIAS	Yes...  Itís him.
MAX	This wasnít what we discussed.

MAX	Whatís the problem.
MATTHIAS	Connection denied.
MAX	Try it again.
MATTHIAS	Itís not working.
MAX	Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
MATTHIAS	I always check the batteries.
MAX	Run it through from the top.

MATTHIAS	Itís working.
MAX	Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...

GRACE	More or less.
MICKEY	More or less...

MICKEY	When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
GRACE	Yes you are.
MICKEY	What was the color of Tim's belt?
GRACE	The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
MICKEY	Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
GRACE	Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
MICKEY	Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
GRACE	Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.

MICKEY	Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
GRACE	That's what Tim said.
MICKEY	So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
GRACE	Yes, I would.

MICKEY	Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
GRACE	Yes, they were.

MICKEY	That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
GRACE	Yes, you are.

MICKEY	Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
GRACE	What...

MICKEY	What kind of pies do you have?
MABEL	Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
MICKEY	Which do you recommend?
MABEL	The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
MICKEY	I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
MABEL	When ya had it, did ya like it?
MICKEY	No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.

WAYNE	Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
MALLORY	It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
WAYNE	What did you think then?
MALLORY	I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
WAYNE	Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
MALLORY	Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
WAYNE	Try to keep it to a minimum.
MALLORY	We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

MALLORY	Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
WAYNE	How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
MALLORY	Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.

MALLORY	Naw, she don't mind.
MICKEY	Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.

MICKEY	Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
MALLORY	Are we in a big hurry?
MICKEY	You got something you want to do?
MALLORY	Yeah.
MICKEY	By all means, knock yourself out.
MALLORY	Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

MALLORY	Mickey!
MICKEY	Don't stop!

MALLORY	Hasn't it?
MICKEY	We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.

MICKEY	Divine intervention.
MALLORY	What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.

MALLORY	Looked like an interview to me.
MICKEY	I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.

WAYNE	Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
MCCLUSKY	The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
WAYNE	Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
MCCLUSKY	Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
WAYNE	When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
MCCLUSKY	What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
WAYNE	Who is we?
MCCLUSKY	The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
WAYNE	Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
MCCLUSKY	Using the same doctors is not common practice.
WAYNE	I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
MCCLUSKY	Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.

MCCLUSKY	Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
SCAGNETTI	Thank you, sir.
MCCLUSKY	Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.

SCAGNETTI	Who isn't?
MCCLUSKY	You been followin' the news coverage?
SCAGNETTI	They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
MCCLUSKY	Susanville, Soledade.
SCAGNETTI	They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
MCCLUSKY	Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.

MCCLUSKY	Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
SCAGNETTI	I can appreciate that.
MCCLUSKY	So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
SCAGNETTI	Lobotomy Bay?
MCCLUSKY	You've heard of it?
SCAGNETTI	So, how do I fit into this scheme?
MCCLUSKY	The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
SCAGNETTI	By all means.
MCCLUSKY	You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...

MCCLUSKY	You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
SCAGNETTI	I see.
MCCLUSKY	You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?

SCAGNETTI	Who's the song bird?
MCCLUSKY	Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.

MCCLUSKY	Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
SCAGNETTI	Ain't love grand.

MICKEY	...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
SCAGNETTI	How's it goin'?

MICKEY	Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
SCAGNETTI	Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
MICKEY	Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
SCAGNETTI	I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.

MICKEY	Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
SCAGNETTI	What?

MICKEY	Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
SCAGNETTI	She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
MICKEY	You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!

SCAGNETTI	Yeah.
MICKEY	Okay, Wayne, step forward.

MICKEY	How come you never talk?
ROGER	She was born without a tongue.
MICKEY	Oh my God!  Sorry.

ROGER	Say something.
MICKEY	What?
ROGER	Anything.

ROGER	Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
MICKEY	There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
ROGER	Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
MICKEY	Tough titty, it's mine now.
ROGER	Look, I'll trade you.

MICKEY	You guys stay on your bellies.
ROGER	Yes, sir.

MICKEY	How is it?
ROGER	Not good.
MICKEY	Do you have a back up.
ROGER	It's video.
MICKEY	Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!

MICKEY	You ready, Donut?
ROGER	Ready.
MICKEY	Wagons, hooaaa!

WAYNE	Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
MICKEY	Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.

WAYNE	The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
MICKEY	Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
WAYNE	Yes.
MICKEY	Whose ratings were higher?
WAYNE	Yours.
MICKEY	How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
WAYNE	Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
MICKEY	Good...yuppie piece of shit.
WAYNE	What I'd like to do---
MICKEY	How 'bout Manson?
WAYNE	Manson beat you.
MICKEY	Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
WAYNE	We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?

WAYNE	My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
MICKEY	Have you talked to Mallory about this?
WAYNE	She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
MICKEY	She doesn't talk?
WAYNE	Not to anybody. She sings.
MICKEY	She sings? What does she sing?
WAYNE	Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.

WAYNE	Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
MICKEY	I'm keen with anticipation.

MICKEY	Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
WAYNE	All right, Mickey.
MICKEY	Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

WAYNE	Sorry about that.
MICKEY	Don't worry about it.
WAYNE	We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
MICKEY	Let's do it.

WAYNE	So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
MICKEY	Aside from the obvious?

MICKEY	Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
WAYNE	What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
MICKEY	What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
WAYNE	Do you miss Mallory?
MICKEY	Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
WAYNE	Then was it worth it?
MICKEY	Was what worth it?
WAYNE	Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?

MICKEY	Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
WAYNE	No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
MICKEY	Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
WAYNE	Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
MICKEY	That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
WAYNE	Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?

WAYNE	You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
MICKEY	You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
WAYNE	Tell me about the purity.
MICKEY	It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
WAYNE	Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
MICKEY	I'm sure we will.
WAYNE	Describe Mallory.
MICKEY	Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
WAYNE	Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
MICKEY	That's indescribable.
WAYNE	Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
MICKEY	Says who?
WAYNE	Says the United States of America.
MICKEY	When have they ever been right?

MICKEY	Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
WAYNE	Okay, let's cut it.

MICKEY	I could go for a Coke.
WAYNE	Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

MICKEY	You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
WAYNE	Sure.
MICKEY	Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.

MICKEY	Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
WAYNE	Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
MICKEY	Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.

MICKEY	Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
WAYNE	Yeah, we have a van.
MICKEY	Where's it parked?
WAYNE	Out front.
MICKEY	Let me have the keys.

WAYNE	Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
MICKEY	No.
WAYNE	This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
MICKEY	Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
WAYNE	We'll all be killed.

MICKEY	That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
WAYNE	On average forty million.
MICKEY	'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
WAYNE	Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
MICKEY	'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...

MICKEY	...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
WAYNE	Yes.

MICKEY	Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
WAYNE	Got it.

MICKEY	We ain't got all fuckin' day!
WAYNE	Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...

MICKEY	C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
WAYNE	So, what now?

WAYNE	Just wait one fucking minute.
MICKEY	I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?

WAYNE	...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
MICKEY	No. Not really.
WAYNE	Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
MICKEY	Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.

WAYNE	Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
MICKEY	We are.  Your camera.

MICKEY	Let's make a little music, Colorada.
WAYNE	NO!!!

MOVIE MALLORY	I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
MOVIE MICKEY	I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
MOVIE MALLORY	I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
MOVIE MICKEY	No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
MOVIE MALLORY	If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
MOVIE MICKEY	No fuckin' way!
MOVIE MALLORY	Mickey, you're wasting time!
MOVIE MICKEY	I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!

MOVIE MICKEY	Yeah baby.
MOVIE MALLORY	You made every day like kindergarten.

WAYNE	Yes.
NORMAN	Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
WAYNE	Yes.

WAYNE	How can you say that you 'admire' them?
NORMAN	It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
WAYNE	Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
NORMAN	They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
WAYNE	And they made the first move?
NORMAN	Unfortunately, yes.

SIMON	I admire them.
NORMAN	I do, too.

NORMAN	Hypnotizing.
SIMON	Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

SIMON	Through the power of the simple word---
NORMAN	And a snake-eye glare.
SIMON	---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
NORMAN	He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
SIMON	He had the edge. The mind's edge.
NORMAN	Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
SIMON	Only on a much grander scale.
NORMAN	They've hypnotized the nation.
SIMON	Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.

SIMON	Yes.
NORMAN	Yes.

NORMAN	That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
SIMON	That's the way of the world.
NORMAN	They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
SIMON	Survival of the fittest.

NORMAN	They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
SIMON	Just for fun, I guess.
NORMAN	And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
SIMON	Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
NORMAN	Apparently, they've seen all our films.
SIMON	They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
NORMAN	So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
SIMON	They actually apologized.

WURLITZER	I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
PITNEY	Capt'n!

PITNEY	Here's the layout of the laundry room.
WURLITZER	Where do the air ducts lead?
PITNEY	Here.

WURLITZER	What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
PITNEY	It's hard to say Capt'n.
WURLITZER	Take a wild stab!
PITNEY	I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
WURLITZER	The entire wing?
PITNEY	That's my opinion.
WURLITZER	Jesus...

WAYNE	Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
ROGER	This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

ROGER	How immediate is immediately?
WAYNE	Next week's episode.

ROGER	Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
WAYNE	I hear ya. Play.

WAYNE	You can't be serious?
ROGER	I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
WAYNE	Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
ROGER	That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
WAYNE	Roger, no.
ROGER	What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
WAYNE	Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
ROGER	So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?

WAYNE	Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
ROGER	Wayne---
WAYNE	Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.

WAYNE	Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
ROGER	Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.

WAYNE	Roger?
ROGER	Rockin'!
WAYNE	Scotty?

WURLITZER	Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
SCAGNETTI	Thanks.

SCAGNETTI	What's the travelling arrangements?
WURLITZER	Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
SCAGNETTI	And where do you keep Mickey?
WURLITZER	We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
SCAGNETTI	Who?
WURLITZER	Wayne Gayle.
SCAGNETTI	Wayne Gayle!

WURLITZER	What the hell happened to you?
SCAGNETTI	You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
WURLITZER	Two-thirty. Shhh...

WURLITZER	Are you all set?
SCAGNETTI	Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
WURLITZER	I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.

SCAGNETTI	Yeah, we met. They're good men.
WURLITZER	They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
SCAGNETTI	Waitin' in the lounge.
WURLITZER	How 'bout Mallory?
SCAGNETTI	Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

SCAGNETTI	Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
WURLITZER	Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

WURLITZER	Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
SCAGNETTI	Yeah, sure.
WURLITZER	I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.

WAYNE	We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
SCOTT	Would the network really not run it without the interview?
WAYNE	Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.

WAYNE	So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
SCOTT	When do you want the assembly?
WAYNE	Tomorrow.

WAYNE	Okay, boys, let's have it.
SCOTT	Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...

WAYNE	Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
SCOTT	Okay.

WAYNE	How's it working, Scotty?
SCOTT	Perfecto!

SCOTT	Rollin'...and speed!
WAYNE	Slate it.

SCOTT	Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
WAYNE	Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!

SCOTT	It's gonna be beautiful.
WAYNE	Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

WAYNE	But how can you say that?
SIMON	They're mesmerising.

SIMON	But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
WAYNE	Why?
SIMON	They passed the 'edge' along to us.
WAYNE	How so?
SIMON	By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
WAYNE	But you'll never be whole again.
SIMON	Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.

WURLITZER	Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
WAYNE	Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
WURLITZER	I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
WAYNE	That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.

WURLITZER	How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
WAYNE	Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
WURLITZER	By all means.

WAYNE	You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
WURLITZER	Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
WAYNE	Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
WURLITZER	Is that her real name?
WAYNE	Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.

WURLITZER	I see.
WAYNE	Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
WURLITZER	Ya know, I was.
WAYNE	Really?
WURLITZER	I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
WAYNE	Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
WURLITZER	Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
WAYNE	See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
WURLITZER	It sure is.
WAYNE	They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.

WURLITZER	Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
WAYNE	Lose 'em.
WURLITZER	Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
WAYNE	Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

WURLITZER	Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
WAYNE	Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
WURLITZER	Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
WAYNE	One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.

WAYNE	We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
WURLITZER	Wayne, if it was anybody else---
WAYNE	Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
WURLITZER	What are we talking about?
WAYNE	Two guys?
WURLITZER	Okay. I'll take two guys off.
WAYNE	No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
WURLITZER	I can't do that. Five guys.
WAYNE	Three.
WURLITZER	I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.

WAYNE	So we got a deal. Four deputies---
WURLITZER	And me.
WAYNE	Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
WURLITZER	Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
WAYNE	Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
WURLITZER	Don't call my men assholes.
WAYNE	I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.

WURLITZER	I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
WAYNE	Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?

WAYNE	Could we go with you and film it?
WURLITZER	Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.

OMAR	I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
DANNY	You hate Raoul?
OMAR	Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!

DANNY	Your Raoul?
OMAR	Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
DANNY	Omar--
OMAR	Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
DANNY	She's coming, Omar, she's coming--

OMAR	I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
DANNY	Omar, listen to me--
OMAR	No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!

OMAR	I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
DANNY	Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
OMAR	Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!

DANNY	Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
OMAR	Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.

NATHAN	Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
DANNY	That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
NATHAN	Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.

NATHAN	Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
DANNY	Since when?
NATHAN	Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.

NATHAN	How long's it been?
DANNY	I'm still on my honeymoon.
NATHAN	So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
DANNY	I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
NATHAN	Negotiator entering Kill Zone.

DANNY	We got any shots?
NATHAN	Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.

RIDDICK	Don't wanna miss this.
AUDREY	Lookit. Lookit!

AUDREY	Gonna lose everybody out here....
RIDDICK	He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.

AUDREY	What? What is it?
RIDDICK	It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!

AUDREY	You came for us....
RIDDICK	Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?

RIDDICK	Probably okay to talk to me now.
AUDREY	Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
RIDDICK	Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....

PARIS	Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
AUDREY	<u>What</u>?

PARIS	Tell me that was you.
AUDREY	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
PARIS	Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.

PARIS	Oh, Lord....
AUDREY	It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....

AUDREY	You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
PARIS	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

FRY	Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
AUDREY	Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.

FRY	Bottle-count.
AUDREY	Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?

AUDREY	I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
FRY	No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.

FRY	Bring the light!
AUDREY	What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
FRY	Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!

AUDREY	Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
FRY	Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?

FRY	Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
RIDDICK	'Mean the whispers?
FRY	What whispers?
RIDDICK	The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.

RIDDICK	All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
FRY	Show me your eyes.

FRY	You did this? To yourself?
RIDDICK	Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
FRY	Heard about it. Just never seen it.
RIDDICK	Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
FRY	Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
RIDDICK	Look deeper.

RIDDICK	Power cells.
FRY	They're coming.
RIDDICK	Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
FRY	I got the quick-and-ugly version.
RIDDICK	An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
FRY	Entered our minds.
RIDDICK	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
FRY	You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?

FRY	Why, what'd you hear?
RIDDICK	Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.

FRY	Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
RIDDICK	Had it with deals.
FRY	But I just wanted to say --
RIDDICK	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.

RIDDICK	Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
FRY	We can, can't we? Trust you?
RIDDICK	Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.

FRY	Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
RIDDICK	Saw something I didn't like.

FRY	What do you see? Riddick?
RIDDICK	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.

FRY	Riddick? What the hell are you --
RIDDICK	<u>Listen</u>.

RIDDICK	Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
FRY	Think about what?

FRY	What about her?
RIDDICK	What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.

RIDDICK	Back to the ship, huh?
FRY	Get out of our way.
RIDDICK	So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?

FRY	How many you see?
RIDDICK	One or two.
FRY	Audrey?

FRY	We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
RIDDICK	Let's drop back an' boot up.

RIDDICK	As fast as you can.
FRY	You sure you can keep --
RIDDICK	As fast as you can.

RIDDICK	So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
FRY	Riddick? How close?

FRY	Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
RIDDICK	We can't make it.

RIDDICK	Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
FRY	You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.

FRY	I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
RIDDICK	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
FRY	What, you're afraid?
RIDDICK	Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
FRY	<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
RIDDICK	Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

FRY	Just come with me!
RIDDICK	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.

RIDDICK	They're already dead. Get on board.
FRY	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
RIDDICK	'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
FRY	No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....

RIDDICK	Step aboard, Carolyn.
FRY	I can't....I can't....
RIDDICK	Here. Make it easy on you.
FRY	Don't do this to me....
RIDDICK	Just give me your hand.
FRY	But they...they could still be....
RIDDICK	No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.

RIDDICK	You'd die for them?
FRY	I would try for them.
RIDDICK	You barely know them.
FRY	But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.

FRY	This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
PARIS	200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

PARIS	What do my eyes see?
FRY	It's starting....

PARIS	Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
FRY	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

FRY	Christ, you don't know what's out there!
PARIS	I know what's in here!

FRY	There....
PARIS	Like the light is scalding it.
FRY	It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....

FRY	...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
PARIS	Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
FRY	How many bottles?
PARIS	Not sure. Ten?
FRY	Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
PARIS	Possibly.
FRY	Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

PARIS	I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
FRY	We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.

FRY	Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
PARIS	Can we switch?
FRY	What, switch what?
PARIS	I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --

FRY	Hey.
JOHNS	Hey, who?
FRY	Hey, me. Over here.

JOHNS	Amazing. I'm Johns.
FRY	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

FRY	And him?
JOHNS	Big Evil?
FRY	We just keep him locked up forever?
JOHNS	Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
FRY	I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
JOHNS	Only around humans.

FRY	S'matter?
JOHNS	Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

JOHNS	A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
FRY	Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
JOHNS	Which means he went toward sunrise.

FRY	What?
JOHNS	Tell me it's not a mirage.

FRY	Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
JOHNS	Probably right.

FRY	No, no, I wanted to get away.
JOHNS	So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.

FRY	Better keep moving....
JOHNS	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?

JOHNS	Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
FRY	Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
JOHNS	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
FRY	During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.

FRY	So now you know.
JOHNS	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.

JOHNS	Didn't bite.
FRY	What?
JOHNS	Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.

FRY	No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
JOHNS	Shut up.

JOHNS	Sorry. Thought I heard something.
FRY	Like what?
JOHNS	Like my pistola.

JOHNS	...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
FRY	Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....

FRY	He used that?
JOHNS	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
FRY	So why isn't it all bloody?
JOHNS	I assume he licked it clean.

JOHNS	I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
FRY	Let's just be sure.
JOHNS	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
FRY	<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
JOHNS	Well, don't ask me to.
FRY	Thought you didn't believe his story.
JOHNS	I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --

FRY	Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
JOHNS	Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
FRY	What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
JOHNS	You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
FRY	Thanks for the tip, Johns.

JOHNS	Little ratty-ass.
FRY	Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.

FRY	Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
JOHNS	How many?
FRY	15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
JOHNS	25 kilos each, huh?

JOHNS	Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
FRY	So what happened? Where are they, then?

JOHNS	Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
FRY	60 years ago.
JOHNS	Wha'?

FRY	...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
JOHNS	Let's wait on the power cells.
FRY	Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
JOHNS	We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
FRY	<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?

FRY	He can pilot?
JOHNS	Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
FRY	Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
JOHNS	He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.

FRY	You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
JOHNS	That's what I said.

FRY	Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
JOHNS	May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
FRY	You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
JOHNS	-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.

FRY	You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
JOHNS	He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.

FRY	Dancin' on razor blades here...
JOHNS	I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.

FRY	You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
JOHNS	I never said I was.
FRY	Never said you were a hype, either.

JOHNS	You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
FRY	And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
JOHNS	Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
FRY	<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
JOHNS	Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
FRY	Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --

JOHNS	My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
FRY	You coulda helped. And you didn't.

FRY	Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
JOHNS	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

JOHNS	Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
FRY	We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.

JOHNS	Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
FRY	Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
JOHNS	Smoke screen for what?
FRY	For your own fear.
JOHNS	Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

FRY	How much you weigh, Johns?
JOHNS	What the hell's it matter?
FRY	How much?
JOHNS	79 kilos.
FRY	Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.

JOHNS	He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
FRY	We're just burnin' light here.
JOHNS	You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
FRY	I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.

JOHNS	So you noticed too?
FRY	Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.

JOHNS	We aren't completely stupid.
FRY	Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --

JOHNS	Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
FRY	I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
JOHNS	I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
FRY	Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
JOHNS	No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --

FRY	This does not help us, Johns.
JOHNS	-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
FRY	Just shut up, okay?
JOHNS	-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
FRY	Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

FRY	We cannot go through there....
JOHNS	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

FRY	It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
ZEKE	So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
FRY	Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

ZEKE	Well? Is it just the pump?
FRY	Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!

FRY	Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
ZEKE	What, you're goin' off, too?
FRY	Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.

OWENS	Why did I fall on you?
FRY	He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
OWENS	I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
FRY	You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
OWENS	Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?

FRY	1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
OWENS	Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

OWENS	Fry?
FRY	Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
OWENS	You mean that "load" of passengers?
FRY	So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?

OWENS	Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
FRY	Company's not here, is it?
OWENS	When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
FRY	And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!

FRY	Owens!
OWENS	70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!

FRY	I don't suppose....
IMAM	One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.

FRY	So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
IMAM	You know who Muhammad was?
FRY	Some prophet guy?
IMAM	Some prophet guy. And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
FRY	You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
IMAM	Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
FRY	Frightening thought.
IMAM	We're all on the same hajj now.

IMAM	One is all?
FRY	For now.

FRY	I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
IMAM	Quiet, please. Everyone.

IMAM	Hasan?
FRY	Riddick?

FRY	They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
IMAM	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
FRY	No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.

FRY	Imam. Slow down.
IMAM	What?
FRY	Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
IMAM	I would rather we all stay--
FRY	Do what I say. Please.

IMAM	The sled as a shield....
FRY	And what about the cells?

FRY	Oh, no. No, no, no....
IMAM	Rain.

IMAM	Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
RIDDICK	Has anyone checked the coring room?

IMAM	Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
RIDDICK	There is no "safe."

IMAM	Where's Mr. Johns?
RIDDICK	Which half?
IMAM	You mean....

RIDDICK	What're you doin'?
IMAM	Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
RIDDICK	And pointless.
IMAM	I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
RIDDICK	You <u>don't</u> see.

RIDDICK	'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
IMAM	He will be with us. Nonetheless.
RIDDICK	Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.

IMAM	Suleiman!
RIDDICK	Get the girl back under. Keep going.
IMAM	SULEIMAN!
RIDDICK	KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

IMAM	New Mecca....
RIDDICK	Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
IMAM	It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.

JOHNS	For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
IMAM	All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.

IMAM	God is Great, yes?
JOHNS	I'm born-again.

JOHNS	We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
IMAM	The child heard you before any of us could even....

IMAM	I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
JOHNS	Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.

JOHNS	Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
IMAM	Please...this solves nothing...please....

IMAM	We crossed our own tracks.
JOHNS	He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!

IMAM	She's the captain, we should listen to --
JOHNS	Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?

JOHNS	...then we saw this.
PARIS	Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?

JOHNS	King Tut's tomb....
PARIS	Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.

JOHNS	A toast to whatever he just said.
PARIS	I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.

JOHNS	What the hell are these?
PARIS	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.

PARIS	So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
JOHNS	Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.

JOHNS	Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
PARIS	Like an emergency life-raft, right?

JOHNS	Very big beads.
PARIS	Not staying in here another....

JOHNS	She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
PARIS	Oh, so I'm disposable?

RIDDICK	Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
JOHNS	We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

JOHNS	Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
RIDDICK	Say that again.
JOHNS	Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
RIDDICK	For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
JOHNS	Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.

RIDDICK	You'd cut me loose, Boss?
JOHNS	Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.

RIDDICK	My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
JOHNS	If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

JOHNS	Are you fuckin' kidding me?
RIDDICK	Not afraid of the dark, are you?

JOHNS	I'd rather piss glass.
RIDDICK	Well, you got the big gauge.
JOHNS	Wanna rag your fat mouth?

RIDDICK	Think about that reward, Johns.
JOHNS	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
RIDDICK	How 'bout a cut in your gut?

JOHNS	<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
RIDDICK	Said "looks clear."
JOHNS	Well, what's it look like now?
RIDDICK	Looks clear.

JOHNS	Such as.
RIDDICK	Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

JOHNS	About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
RIDDICK	About the girl.

JOHNS	What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
RIDDICK	No. She's not.

JOHNS	Aw, this can't be happening to me....
RIDDICK	They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.

JOHNS	Ain't all of us gonna make it.
RIDDICK	Just realized that, huh?

JOHNS	Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
RIDDICK	Not if I'm the one.
JOHNS	What if you're one of five?

JOHNS	Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
RIDDICK	Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
JOHNS	Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
RIDDICK	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
JOHNS	<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
RIDDICK	Nice embellishment.
JOHNS	Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
RIDDICK	So which one caught your eye?
JOHNS	Don' look, don' look, don' look....

RIDDICK	What's her name, anyway?
JOHNS	What do you care?

JOHNS	Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
RIDDICK	What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
JOHNS	What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
RIDDICK	Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.

JOHNS	Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
RIDDICK	Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
JOHNS	Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

ZEKE	An' this?
PARIS	Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
ZEKE	'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
PARIS	Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

ZEKE	So much for your nightfall.
PARIS	So much for my cocktail hour.

PARIS	Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
ZEKE	Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

SHAZZA	Not a star-jumper.
RIDDICK	Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?

RIDDICK	What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
SHAZZA	Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
RIDDICK	I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

SHAZZA	You were tryin' to kill him too.
RIDDICK	Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.

SHAZZA	Take it.
RIDDICK	What, it's broken?
SHAZZA	Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

BODHI	Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
UTAH	Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
BODHI	And that's why you never went pro?
UTAH	Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
BODHI	Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
UTAH	Not yet.

UTAH	Friends of yours, huh?
BODHI	The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
UTAH	What's their program?
BODHI	They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
UTAH	You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
BODHI	No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
UTAH	Thanks for stepping in.
BODHI	De nada.

UTAH	Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
UTAH	Where?
BODHI	Come with Tyler.  She knows.

UTAH	Don't you gamble?
BODHI	Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.

UTAH	So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
BODHI	No, Bells Beach, Australia.

UTAH	I gotta be fucking crazy.
BODHI	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?

BODHI	Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
UTAH	I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
BODHI	I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
UTAH	A flaw I'm working on.
BODHI	The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
UTAH	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.

UTAH	How you figure?
BODHI	News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.

UTAH	One shot stopping.
BODHI	'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.

BODHI	Ever done this before?
UTAH	Once.
BODHI	Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
UTAH	Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
BODHI	Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!

BODHI	It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
UTAH	So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
BODHI	I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
UTAH	You gotta earn trust.
BODHI	Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.

UTAH	We gonna jump or jerk off?
BODHI	My man!

BODHI	Utah, you copy bruddah?
UTAH	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
BODHI	I'll take that as a yes.

BODHI	You gonna pull?
UTAH	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!

BODHI	Don't screw around man, pull it!
UTAH	You do it... you first!
BODHI	One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
UTAH	You first!
BODHI	Okay!

UTAH	What's this?
BODHI	Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.

UTAH	You're a fucking dead man--
BODHI	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.

UTAH	Talk.
BODHI	She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.

UTAH	You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
BODHI	Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.

UTAH	We're wasting time.
BODHI	See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.

UTAH	I can't do this.
BODHI	Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
UTAH	Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
BODHI	Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?

UTAH	I'm not armed.
BODHI	But you're not alone.
UTAH	Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.

UTAH	Where's Roach?
BODHI	Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
UTAH	You gotta tell me where she is.
BODHI	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
UTAH	Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
BODHI	I say when it's over!
UTAH	The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.

BODHI	Why should I?
UTAH	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.

BODHI	Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
UTAH	No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
BODHI	Naw, you pull it!

BODHI	Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
UTAH	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
BODHI	Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...

BODHI	Three seconds... two... one...
UTAH	SHIT!!

BODHI	Wild ride, huh?
UTAH	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!

BODHI	And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
UTAH	I'm not FBI anymore.
BODHI	You never were...
UTAH	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...

FIBERGLASS	Yeah?  What?
PAPPAS	Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
FIBERGLASS	No.

PAPPAS	You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
FIBERGLASS	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
PAPPAS	Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
FIBERGLASS	There's nobody else here...

HARP	You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
UTAH	Yes, sir.

HARP	Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
UTAH	Sir?
HARP	All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
UTAH	I take the skin off chicken.

HARP	This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
UTAH	1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
HARP	That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
UTAH	Zero distortion, sir.

HARP	You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
UTAH	Not so far.

HARP	How was the beach?
UTAH	Fine.
HARP	Surf conditions okay?
UTAH	A little mushy.
HARP	A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
UTAH	Babes.
HARP	What?
UTAH	The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.

HARP	Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
UTAH	Caught my first tube this morning.

HARP	Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
UTAH	Take your hand off my shoulder right now.

HARP	They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
PAPPAS	What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
HARP	Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.

PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
HARP	That's the point, isn't it?
PAPPAS	Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
HARP	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

PAPPAS	Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
HARP	Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--

PAPPAS	Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
HARP	What that?

PAPPAS	Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
UTAH	The shit they pull, huh?

PAPPAS	Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
UTAH	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
PAPPAS	Welcome to Sea World, kid.

UTAH	Good move.
PAPPAS	Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

UTAH	They don't go for the vault?
PAPPAS	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
UTAH	Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
PAPPAS	Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.

UTAH	Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
PAPPAS	The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.

PAPPAS	You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
UTAH	Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
PAPPAS	Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
UTAH	So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
PAPPAS	You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!

UTAH	Sorry.
PAPPAS	Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
UTAH	Yeah.  What's your theory?
PAPPAS	The fucking punks are surfers.

UTAH	Oh well he must be a surfer.
PAPPAS	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.

UTAH	Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
PAPPAS	The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.

UTAH	Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
PAPPAS	Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
UTAH	Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.

UTAH	... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
PAPPAS	Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.

PAPPAS	Johnny, it's the only way.
UTAH	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.

PAPPAS	They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
UTAH	Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
PAPPAS	It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?

PAPPAS	I think you gotta hit them straight on!
UTAH	Got it...

PAPPAS	What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
UTAH	It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
PAPPAS	Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.

UTAH	Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
PAPPAS	Guy's the Toxic Avenger.

UTAH	The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
PAPPAS	No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

UTAH	Big zippo so far.  How about you?
PAPPAS	Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.

UTAH	No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
PAPPAS	Thanks, buddy.

PAPPAS	Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
UTAH	Okay, Dad.

UTAH	... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
PAPPAS	Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.

UTAH	When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
PAPPAS	He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.

PAPPAS	Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
UTAH	Right here, partner.

UTAH	I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
UTAH	Got it.
PAPPAS	Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.

UTAH	Aw shit.
PAPPAS	Nice tattoo, Dietz.

PAPPAS	Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
UTAH	Angelo, we gotta talk.

UTAH	... so I started tailing him.
PAPPAS	This Zen master surfer.
UTAH	Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
PAPPAS	Did he rob it?
UTAH	Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
UTAH	Yeah, or cashing a check.
UTAH	Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
PAPPAS	Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
UTAH	Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.

PAPPAS	They're on their way to Maui.
UTAH	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.

UTAH	I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
PAPPAS	Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
UTAH	I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
PAPPAS	Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.

PAPPAS	Time for lunch.
UTAH	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
PAPPAS	That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.

UTAH	The hell are they?!
PAPPAS	They took a left at the next light!
UTAH	You sure?!

PAPPAS	Nothing?
UTAH	Nothing.

UTAH	I know where they're going.
PAPPAS	Figured you did.

UTAH	Angelo!  Don't fire!
PAPPAS	Kid, get outta the way!!
UTAH	NOOO!!

TYLER	What do you want?
UTAH	Shrimp and fries.
TYLER	I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
UTAH	I need you to teach me.
TYLER	Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
UTAH	I'm serious.
TYLER	I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
UTAH	Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.

TYLER	What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
UTAH	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
TYLER	This gonna take long?
UTAH	Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?

UTAH	I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
TYLER	Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.

TYLER	Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
UTAH	Sure.

UTAH	Nice place.
TYLER	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.

UTAH	Who's the girl?
TYLER	Catch of the day.
UTAH	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
TYLER	People are expendable to Bodhi.
UTAH	Meaning you were expendable.
TYLER	We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
UTAH	Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
TYLER	Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.

TYLER	Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
UTAH	What are you talking about?
TYLER	I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.

UTAH	What's goin' on?
TYLER	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.

UTAH	I can barely do this in broad daylight.
TYLER	Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.

TYLER	You had enough?
UTAH	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.

TYLER	Look at you.
UTAH	What?
TYLER	Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
UTAH	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
TYLER	You don't have to.

TYLER	Those are cold.
UTAH	Warm them up.

UTAH	I... I gotta go.
TYLER	Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
UTAH	No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.

UTAH	Ouch.
TYLER	Betadyne doesn't hurt.
UTAH	You're kneeling on my hand.

TYLER	So what'd the other guy look like?
UTAH	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
TYLER	But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?

TYLER	Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
UTAH	Tyler, put the gun down.
TYLER	You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!

UTAH	I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
TYLER	Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!

UTAH	Well, I saw you and--
WOMAN	Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!

UTAH	Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
WOMAN	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
UTAH	My name's Johnny Utah!
WOMAN	Who cares!
UTAH	I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.

UTAH	Bye.
WOMAN	Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

DAPPER GENT	Do you have it?
GREGOR	Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
DAPPER GENT	This is important.
GREGOR	Do you really think so?
DAPPER GENT	You know it is.

DAPPER GENT	Why did you do that?
GREGOR	To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...

GREGOR	It's under your seat.
DAPPER GENT	What?
GREGOR	As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.

DEIRDRE	Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
VINCENT	Of course.

VINCENT	We kept it...
DEIRDRE	Is that right?

VINCENT	While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
DEIRDRE	Leaving...

VINCENT	And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
DEIRDRE	Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.

DEIRDRE	Of course.
VINCENT	Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
DEIRDRE	I don't know.
VINCENT	When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
DEIRDRE	Well I don't!
VINCENT	And I don't believe you...

DEIRDRE	You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
VINCENT	I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!

DEIRDRE	Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
VINCENT	So where do you go from here?
DEIRDRE	I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
VINCENT	I'm up for that...

DEIRDRE	It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
LARRY	Who the fuck are you?
DEIRDRE	The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.

LARRY	I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
DEIRDRE	And who are you?

LARRY	So what's the deal?
DEIRDRE	The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.

LARRY	You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
DEIRDRE	Which leads us to...

LARRY	Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
DEIRDRE	And then...

DEIRDRE	And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
LARRY	How do we know that?

LARRY	I never did trust that blonde fuck...
DEIRDRE	That's why you were riding with him.

LARRY	This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
DEIRDRE	Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
LARRY	What is?
DEIRDRE	Best beer in the world known to man or God.
LARRY	Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
DEIRDRE	Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
LARRY	Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
DEIRDRE	I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

DEIRDRE	When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
SEAMUS	Now there's the Deirdre I know.
DEIRDRE	And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
SEAMUS	It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
DEIRDRE	So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
SEAMUS	It's been known to happen.
DEIRDRE	Not to me, you know that.
SEAMUS	I thought I did.

SEAMUS	Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
DEIRDRE	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
SEAMUS	Nothing.

SEAMUS	What in bloody hell is going on?
DEIRDRE	They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
SEAMUS	From Interpol?
DEIRDRE	That's him.

SEAMUS	Lose them!
DEIRDRE	You lose them!

SEAMUS	About time!
DEIRDRE	Not yet...

SEAMUS	Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
DEIRDRE	They're good!

DEIRDRE	You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
SEAMUS	Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
DEIRDRE	You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
SEAMUS	Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?

SEAMUS	Do I need to repeat myself?
DEIRDRE	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

SAM	Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
DEIRDRE	You were a soldier, were you?
SAM	Once.

SAM	Hazard pay...
DEIRDRE	The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
SAM	We weren't real thrilled about it either...

DEIRDRE	I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
SAM	I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
DEIRDRE	I still am.
SAM	Is that right?
DEIRDRE	That's right.

SAM	Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
DEIRDRE	Nobody's saying they don't.
SAM	And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
DEIRDRE	I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...

DEIRDRE	Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
SAM	You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
DEIRDRE	I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
SAM	You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
DEIRDRE	Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.

DEIRDRE	I better be getting that.
SAM	Duty calls?
DEIRDRE	Just business.

SAM	Now, what did we steal?
DEIRDRE	I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.

SAM	Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
DEIRDRE	Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

DEIRDRE	I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
SAM	Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
DEIRDRE	That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

DEIRDRE	Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
SAM	Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
DEIRDRE	I'm a patriate.
SAM	Don't even think that I'm buying that.
DEIRDRE	Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
SAM	I didn't say I was.
DEIRDRE	Bloody fucking hell...

SAM	Are you alright?
DEIRDRE	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!

SAM	Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
DEIRDRE	Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?

GREGOR	Who are you?  IRA?
DEIRDRE	Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.

DEIRDRE	From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
GREGOR	These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.

GREGOR	It's quite satifactory.
DEIRDRE	Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
GREGOR	I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
DEIRDRE	You sure about this?
GREGOR	I'd stake my reputation.
DEIRDRE	But would you stake your life, that's the question...
GREGOR	In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.

DEIRDRE	Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
GREGOR	I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
DEIRDRE	Next.

DEIRDRE	Alright, Gregor, I'm...
GREGOR	Ready when you are...

DEIRDRE	Where's the case?
GREGOR	There's a problem...

DEIRDRE	That fucking figures...
GREGOR	Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.

GREGOR	Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
DEIRDRE	Don't do it, Sam!
GREGOR	Shut up!
DEIRDRE	He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.

EDVARD	Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
GREGOR	I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
EDVARD	That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
GREGOR	I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
EDVARD	We'll double your price.
GREGOR	Really?  Do you have the money with you?
EDVARD	Do you have the material?
GREGOR	You first, Edvard.
EDVARD	Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
GREGOR	I think not.  After you...

VINCENT	Do you have it?
FRANCOIS	Not so fast.  Who's that?
VINCENT	He's company.
FRANCOIS	Bad company...
VINCENT	What do you mean?
FRANCOIS	He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!

VINCENT	Here's yours.
FRANCOIS	There's been a slight problem.
VINCENT	What's that?

FRANCOIS	If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
VINCENT	I take it you still want the money...
FRANCOIS	Of course.

VINCENT	Where's my information?
FRANCOIS	In here...
VINCENT	Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.

MIKHI	Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
GREGOR	No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
MIKHI	Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
GREGOR	Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
MIKHI	I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
GREGOR	Enough!

MIKHI	And more importantly --
GREGOR	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

GREGOR	We'll die if we stay here!
MIKHI	You'll die if you leave here.

SEAMUS	If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
GREGOR	I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...

SEAMUS	This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
GREGOR	It is, I'm telling you it is!!
SEAMUS	You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

SEAMUS	What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
GREGOR	But you hate each other!
SEAMUS	What's a little hate between business partners?

GREGOR	So, you've got it all figured, do you?
SEAMUS	Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
GREGOR	I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.

GREGOR	Whoever hired us.
SAM	I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...

SAM	So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
GREGOR	Now that is an interesting proposition.

SAM	Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
GREGOR	I don't have it with me...
SAM	Bullshit!
GREGOR	I swear...
SAM	Then where is it?
GREGOR	I sent it to myself in Paris.
SAM	Sent it where?
GREGOR	A post office box.

PHONE VOICE	Is it done?
GREGOR	It's done.

PHONE VOICE	Gregor, is that you?
GREGOR	Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
PHONE VOICE	It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
GREGOR	I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
PHONE VOICE	So what do we do?
GREGOR	What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.

SWEDE	How so?
GREGOR	Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.

GREGOR	I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
SWEDE	I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
GREGOR	A means to an end, is that it?
SWEDE	That's it.
GREGOR	Then I guess we're set.
SWEDE	There is one other thing...
GREGOR	What's that?

GREGOR	What are you doing?
SWEDE	Don't cross me...
GREGOR	Nobody's going to do that!
SWEDE	Really?
GREGOR	I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
SWEDE	I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
GREGOR	I do, I do...

VINCENT	Hello, Jean-Pierre.
JEAN-PIERRE	Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

JEAN-PIERRE	He's tough, your American friend.
VINCENT	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
JEAN-PIERRE	And you respect him.
VINCENT	Of course.  Don't you?
JEAN-PIERRE	I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
VINCENT	Not exactly.
JEAN-PIERRE	Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
VINCENT	How did you know?
JEAN-PIERRE	If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.

SAM	American.
JEAN-PIERRE	Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?

JEAN-PIERRE	Are you sure you won't have a drink?
SAM	No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.

SAM	You think you can stitch me up on you own?
JEAN-PIERRE	Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
SAM	Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.

SAM	Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
JEAN-PIERRE	You should really let a doctor look at that.
SAM	Soon.
JEAN-PIERRE	But first you have something to take care of?
SAM	Yeah.
JEAN-PIERRE	Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
SAM	It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
JEAN-PIERRE	Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.

JEAN-PIERRE	He sees this differently, as you well know.
SAM	I didn't expect that he would.
JEAN-PIERRE	You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
SAM	Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
JEAN-PIERRE	Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.

SAM	So this is what, a test?
JEAN-PIERRE	Call it a reckoning of character.

SAM	If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
JEAN-PIERRE	Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.

SAM	So what is it you want to know?
JEAN-PIERRE	I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
SAM	Created?
JEAN-PIERRE	Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
SAM	Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
JEAN-PIERRE	You seem one to me.
SAM	A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.

SAM	The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
LARRY	Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.

SAM	You shoot alright.
LARRY	Gets the job done.
SAM	All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
LARRY	Not for long.
SAM	Long enough to shoot back.
LARRY	Is that right?
SAM	It's been known to happen.
LARRY	Why don't you go do better, then...

LARRY	Yeah, well...  My way works too.
SAM	My way is better.

SAM	It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
LARRY	Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...

LARRY	What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
SAM	Did he bring that with him?

LARRY	What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
SWEDE	What a surprise...
LARRY	I got a surprise for you, blondie...

SWEDE	They call me Swede.
LARRY	Who's they?
SWEDE	Everybody.

SWEDE	You should watch what you eat.
LARRY	Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
SWEDE	I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
LARRY	And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
SWEDE	Who you calling dumb, dickless?

SWEDE	I ride with fat-boy...
LARRY	Eat shit and die slowly...
SWEDE	After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
LARRY	I blast the lead car into oblivion...

LARRY	Where is this broad?
SWEDE	You should learn a little patience.
LARRY	Is that right?
SWEDE	It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
LARRY	Not in mine.

SWEDE	I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
LARRY	I don't think so.

SAM	Sorry I'm late...
VINCENT	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
SAM	Who else would you be?

VINCENT	Perhaps the police?
SAM	I know cops -- and you're no cop.

VINCENT	Cigarette?
SAM	No thanks.

SAM	He trusts you to lock up?
VINCENT	Let's just say he knows who I am.

VINCENT	I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
SAM	Coordinate what?
VINCENT	Things.  This is my country, you know.

SAM	Where to?
VINCENT	To see a man about a thing.
SAM	I can do that.

VINCENT	Pretty much what you'd expect.
SAM	That's what I thought.

VINCENT	He says this is their block.
SAM	As in, they own it?
VINCENT	Something like that...
SAM	And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
VINCENT	I didn't know that you spoke French.
SAM	I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.

SAM	What'd you say to him?
VINCENT	I asked if we could give him anything else.

VINCENT	That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
SAM	Jujitsu.
VINCENT	Same thing, isn't it?
SAM	Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
VINCENT	What's the difference?
SAM	One's a lot more painful than the other.

VINCENT	Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
SAM	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
VINCENT	A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
SAM	I do.
VINCENT	Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
SAM	It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
VINCENT	There is that.

SAM	So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
VINCENT	Like Larry or Swede.
SAM	Exactly.  Why not bring them?
VINCENT	Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
SAM	Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
VINCENT	So is the woman.
SAM	Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
VINCENT	I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
SAM	I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
VINCENT	I wanted to see who you were.
SAM	Who am I?

VINCENT	You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
SAM	That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
VINCENT	They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
SAM	Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.

VINCENT	Lovely, isn't it?
SAM	They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.

SAM	What's going on?
VINCENT	I just wanted to see something.
SAM	See what?

VINCENT	I needed to know.
SAM	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

SAM	You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
VINCENT	I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
SAM	Well I ain't a cop.

VINCENT	How did you know?
SAM	Know what?
VINCENT	That there was a gun pointed at me.
SAM	I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
VINCENT	But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
SAM	Because that's what I would have done...

VINCENT	The question still remains: what do we do now?
SAM	Gregor's cell phone...

SAM	What's going on?
VINCENT	You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...

SAM	I came up here to sneak a smoke.
VINCENT	You were smoking?
SAM	I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
VINCENT	Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.

SAM	I borrowed that, too...
VINCENT	Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
SAM	I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.

SAM	It was at that.
VINCENT	A lot of people died.
SAM	I've seen a lot of people die before.
VINCENT	I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
SAM	You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
VINCENT	I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
SAM	We live in a singular world, my friend.
VINCENT	I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
SAM	You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.

SAM	He's going back.
VINCENT	Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
SAM	It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.

VINCENT	You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
SAM	But you can't.

VINCENT	That makes twice now you've saved my life.
SAM	I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
VINCENT	You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
SAM	You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
VINCENT	No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
SAM	No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
VINCENT	Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
SAM	Not exactly.
VINCENT	You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
SAM	If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
VINCENT	And what job is that?
SAM	My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.

VINCENT	It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
SAM	We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
VINCENT	I'm going with you.
SAM	This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
VINCENT	It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
SAM	You don't have to do this.
VINCENT	Yes I do.

VINCENT	Alright, it's done.
SAM	You see the bullet?
VINCENT	Clearly.
SAM	Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.

VINCENT	You know him?
SAM	I know of him.

SAM	The Irish representative?
VINCENT	Yes.

SAM	What's this?
VINCENT	The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
SAM	Thorough man.

SAM	You sure your friend got the right place?
VINCENT	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

VINCENT	Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
SAM	Do what?
VINCENT	Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
SAM	It's my job.
VINCENT	Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
SAM	Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
VINCENT	It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.

SAM	I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
VINCENT	Dark ops?
SAM	Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
VINCENT	Very ugly.
SAM	It is at that.
VINCENT	Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
SAM	I never made that claim.
VINCENT	I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
SAM	You were behind the door?
VINCENT	I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
SAM	You would have done that?
VINCENT	I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
SAM	How could you have done that?
VINCENT	Because I owe you.  Look at that...

SAM	They don't have the package.
VINCENT	You think?
SAM	You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.

VINCENT	What the fuck happened?
SAM	I don't know...
VINCENT	You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.

SAM	Give me a cigarette.
VINCENT	Right now?
SAM	Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
VINCENT	Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?

VINCENT	I'm not here very much.
SAM	Business keeps you on the road?
VINCENT	Something like that.

SAM	I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
VINCENT	So I do it.
SAM	No you don't, and you know it.
VINCENT	If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
SAM	In a minute.
VINCENT	I think not.

VINCENT	Do we need anything else?
SAM	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

SAM	Not here.  They might see it.
VINCENT	If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.

SAM	Time to quit.
VINCENT	Just like that?
SAM	Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
VINCENT	What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
SAM	Would you stop with that...
VINCENT	Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
SAM	The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
VINCENT	Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
SAM	Because I don't walk away.
VINCENT	Why not?
SAM	It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
VINCENT	Closest and oldest.
SAM	And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
VINCENT	And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
SAM	That's a good question.
VINCENT	Do you have a good answer?
SAM	No, I don't.

VINCENT	You have to stop doing that!
SAM	I'll work on it...

SAM	Let's get him out of here...
VINCENT	Finish the job...
SAM	And now...
VINCENT	Finish it!

VINCENT	You son-of-a-bitch...
SAM	What?
VINCENT	You speak French.
SAM	What of it?
VINCENT	Nothing...

VINCENT	Your field dressing saved his life. That's three I owe you.
SAM	You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
VINCENT	I know.
SAM	You better get some sleep, alright?
VINCENT	Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
SAM	I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
VINCENT	What happened to it?
SAM	Gone.  Destroyed.
VINCENT	I guess that's for the best.

SAM	I told you, I quit.
VINCENT	Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.

SAM	What's the story?
TONY	It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.

SAM	Gaelic.
TONY	You sure?
SAM	I'm sure.

SAM	Why's that?
TONY	Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
SAM	It's the Irish tape we want.
TONY	Gonna be tough.

TONY	Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
SAM	Seamus Reilly.

VINCENT	Why didn't you kill her?
SEAMUS	Why didn't you kill him?

VINCENT	You slept with her!
SEAMUS	How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?

VINCENT	You slept with her!
SEAMUS	You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
VINCENT	You put everything on the line because you...
SEAMUS	You slept with the fucker!!

TONY	My man, how you doing?
VINCENT	I'm alright.  And you?
TONY	Doing well.  This is?
VINCENT	A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
TONY	Why don't we step into my office...

VINCENT	I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
TONY	Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

VINCENT	Do you have the tape?
TONY	I might know where you could get a copy.

TONY	What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
VINCENT	You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
TONY	All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.

VINCENT	Can you get it?
TONY	The Russian would be easier.

TONY	Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
VINCENT	I get the picture.

VINCENT	Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
TONY	I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
VINCENT	It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.

CAPTAIN DIEL	Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
CARTER	Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
CAPTAIN DIEL	It's nine-thirty in the morning.
CARTER	Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
CAPTAIN DIEL	Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
CARTER	Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
CAPTAIN DIEL	I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
CARTER	Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
CAPTAIN DIEL	No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
CARTER	Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!

CARTER	What the hell is that?
CRAPS DEALER	Those are five hundred dollar chips.
CARTER	Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
CRAPS DEALER	No, I just assumed...
CARTER	You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
CRAPS DEALER	No, sir.
CARTER	Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?

CRAPS DEALER	Winner six!
CARTER	How much is that?
CRAPS DEALER	Two-hundred thousand!
CARTER	Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?

CRAPS DEALER	Winner!  Four, winner!
CARTER	I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!

DOORMAN #1	Invitation, please.
CARTER	I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
DOORMAN #1	The band has been playing over an hour.
CARTER	I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.

DOORMAN #1	Wait.
CARTER	Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
DOORMAN #1	Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.

KENNY	Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
CARTER	What??  Where'd you hear that?
KENNY	I got my sources.
CARTER	And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
KENNY	James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
CARTER	Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
KENNY	Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
CARTER	I'd like to see you try.

CARTER	Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
KENNY	Is this about the funny money?
CARTER	How'd you know?
KENNY	You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
CARTER	So tell me what you know.
KENNY	I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
CARTER	Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.

CARTER	What?
KENNY	One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.

KENNY	I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
CARTER	All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.

CARTER	How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
ISABELLA	Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
CARTER	San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
ISABELLA	I don't think so.
CARTER	I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
ISABELLA	This is your ship?
CARTER	That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
ISABELLA	El Capitan?
CARTER	I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
ISABELLA	Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
CARTER	Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
ISABELLA	The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
CARTER	Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
ISABELLA	I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
CARTER	Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.

ISABELLA	You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
CARTER	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
ISABELLA	I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
CARTER	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.

CARTER	Yeah, that's right.
ISABELLA	We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
ISABELLA	Look, I've been working this case for months now...
CARTER	So what's your story?
ISABELLA	They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

CARTER	It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
ISABELLA	It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
CARTER	How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
ISABELLA	In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.

ISABELLA	They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
CARTER	What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
ISABELLA	The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.

RICKY TAN	I'm busy at the moment.
CARTER	I said get on your feet!
RICKY TAN	I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
CARTER	I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!

CARTER	Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
RICKY TAN	I don't think so...

CARTER	I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
RICKY TAN	It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
CARTER	That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

RICKY TAN	Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
CARTER	I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

RICKY TAN	Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
CARTER	Lee, you okay?

RICKY TAN	Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
CARTER	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.

HOSTESS	Oh, you American?
CARTER	That's right.
HOSTESS	You bring American money?
CARTER	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.

HOSTESS	You get massage from Chinese girl before?
CARTER	No.  It's my first time.
HOSTESS	You pick any girl for you and your friend.

CARTER	Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
HOSTESS	Oh yes, she's very nice.
CARTER	She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.

CARTER	Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
STEVEN REIGN	I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.

CARTER	Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
STEVEN REIGN	Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
CARTER	Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
STEVEN REIGN	Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
CARTER	You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
STEVEN REIGN	You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.

CARTER	I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
LEE	That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
CARTER	Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
LEE	Those girls drove off because of you.
CARTER	All I did was invite them for a drink.
LEE	You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
CARTER	I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

LEE	You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
CARTER	Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
LEE	Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
CARTER	Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!

LEE	Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
CARTER	Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
LEE	Carter, would I lie to you?

CARTER	That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
LEE	No.
CARTER	You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.

CARTER	Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
LEE	No.
CARTER	Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.

LEE	I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
CARTER	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
LEE	Bathroom.

LEE	Carter, get off that stage!
CARTER	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

LEE	This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
CARTER	I knew you were lying.
LEE	I'm sorry.
CARTER	Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
LEE	No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
CARTER	Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
LEE	Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
CARTER	Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
LEE	No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
CARTER	You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.

CARTER	What'd I say?
LEE	You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
CARTER	Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.

CARTER	All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
LEE	Try to land on your feet.

CARTER	You lied to me.
LEE	I'm sorry.
CARTER	You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
LEE	No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.

CARTER	I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
LEE	This won't take long.

CARTER	And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
LEE	Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

LEE	Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
CARTER	I am a tourist.

LEE	Hello.
CARTER	How you doin'?
LEE	My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.

LEE	What are you doing?
CARTER	She said I could pick any girl I want.
LEE	Well, hurry up.
CARTER	Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.

CARTER	What's wrong?
LEE	Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
CARTER	That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
LEE	This is a very dangerous man.
CARTER	I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
LEE	I'm calling for back up!

CARTER	Goddamn you got a small ass.
LEE	Don't look at my ass!

LEE	Where are you going?
CARTER	Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
LEE	Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
CARTER	Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
LEE	Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
CARTER	My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
LEE	It's my job!
CARTER	You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
LEE	I have plenty of dates.
CARTER	Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
LEE	You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
CARTER	And you ain't black!

LEE	Carter?
CARTER	Who died?
LEE	You.
CARTER	Detective Yu?  Never met him.
LEE	Not Yu.  You!
CARTER	Who?
LEE	Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
CARTER	Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

CARTER	What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
LEE	I'm okay, you go.
CARTER	Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
LEE	Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
CARTER	What the hell is going on here?

CARTER	What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
LEE	I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
CARTER	Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
LEE	Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
CARTER	I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
LEE	No.  She's a school teacher.
CARTER	You're not very good at this, are you?
LEE	Good at what?
CARTER	Forget it.

LEE	Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
CARTER	Ask me if I give a shit.

LEE	He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
CARTER	How the hell did Tan get away with it?
LEE	All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
CARTER	This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?

LEE	No, no, that would be crazy --
CARTER	You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
LEE	I thought you'd think it was crazy.
CARTER	IT IS CRAZY!
LEE	I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

CARTER	So are you getting on the plane or not?!
LEE	What?
CARTER	Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
LEE	I cannot go to LA...

CARTER	It sounds impossible --
LEE	You said --
CARTER	-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.

CARTER	You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
LEE	Why LA?
CARTER	I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.

LEE	I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
CARTER	Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
LEE	Follow the Rich White Man?
CARTER	Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
LEE	Follow the RichWhiteMan...
CARTER	Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
LEE	Who?
CARTER	Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
LEE	How do you know he's our man?
CARTER	Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
LEE	You sound like that all the time.
CARTER	Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
LEE	Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
CARTER	Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
LEE	Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
CARTER	The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

CARTER	Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
LEE	He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
CARTER	He'll be back soon.
LEE	How do you know?
CARTER	Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.

LEE	Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
CARTER	Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
LEE	The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
CARTER	You pull a muscle or something?
LEE	My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
CARTER	I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
LEE	It's a long story.
CARTER	Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
LEE	No.  It was my singing.
CARTER	Excuse me?
LEE	She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.

LEE	She's just standing around -- not doing much.
CARTER	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
LEE	I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

LEE	Slow down, baby.
CARTER	What did you say?
LEE	Nothing.  I said nothing.

LEE	Is it hot in here?
CARTER	Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
LEE	I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
CARTER	What's going on?

LEE	She's getting undressed.
CARTER	Gimme the binoculars.
LEE	No.  It's not right.
CARTER	Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.

LEE	What's she doing?
CARTER	Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
LEE	I don't want to hear this.
CARTER	Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
LEE	Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
CARTER	She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

CARTER	Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
LEE	What?
CARTER	She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
LEE	What is it?
CARTER	No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

LEE	I don't understand?
CARTER	She's walking back towards the door.

CARTER	Pick it up!
LEE	It's your turn!
CARTER	I don't need a turn!

LEE	Wait!  There's people down there!
CARTER	There's people up here!
LEE	Get it out of here!
CARTER	Take it!

CARTER	I wouldn't do that!!!
LEE	It's a bomb.

CARTER	Let me see it again?
LEE	We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

CARTER	Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
LEE	We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
CARTER	They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
LEE	She never even looked at you.
CARTER	You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
LEE	I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
CARTER	Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.

LEE	Are you okay?
CARTER	What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
LEE	She saved our lives.
CARTER	For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.

CARTER	Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
LEE	Shhh, my head hurts.
CARTER	I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
LEE	Why did you help me?
CARTER	It doesn't matter.

LEE	I'm not used to having a partner.
CARTER	We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
LEE	Well we're not friends.
CARTER	You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
LEE	Fine with me.
CARTER	I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
LEE	See you in the next world.
CARTER	I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
LEE	Fine.
CARTER	I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
LEE	Yes.  We have heaven.
CARTER	Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
LEE	What's a Chinese heaven?
CARTER	I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
LEE	I think we should stop talking.
CARTER	Fine by me.
CARTER	You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
LEE	No.
CARTER	If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
LEE	Mind your own business.
CARTER	How was the sex?
LEE	There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
CARTER	You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
LEE	No mu-shu.
CARTER	What about a little king pao chicken?
LEE	No kung pao chicken.  Never.
CARTER	Steamed dumplings?
LEE	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
CARTER	That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
LEE	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
CARTER	Are you serious?
LEE	Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

CARTER	As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
LEE	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
CARTER	That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
LEE	They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
CARTER	Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

CARTER	Very nice.
LEE	It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
CARTER	I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.

CARTER	Hello, Benjamin.
LEE	Who's Benjamin?
CARTER	Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
LEE	A Chinese man discovered electricity.
CARTER	No Chinese man discovered electricity.
LEE	Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
CARTER	Now that I believe.

LEE	We're slowing down.  This must be it.
CARTER	End of the line.
LEE	You've been a good friend, James Carter.
CARTER	Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
LEE	You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
CARTER	Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.

LEE	Vegas...
CARTER	Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.

LEE	Red Dragon.
CARTER	That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

LEE	Let's go.
CARTER	Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
LEE	What is Mac out?
CARTER	Follow me my Asian brother.

CARTER	Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
LEE	Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.

CARTER	That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
LEE	Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
CARTER	Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

LEE	Carter...here comes the rich white man.
CARTER	Wait here.  I'll handle this.

CARTER	Lee, what the hell are you doing?
LEE	Dancing?
CARTER	Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
LEE	It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.

CARTER	Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
LEE	No.  I'm going to find out.
CARTER	Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.

CARTER	I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
LEE	Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
CARTER	I'll give it my best shot.

CARTER	Lee!
LEE	MMMMMM!!!!

CARTER	Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
LEE	I did!
CARTER	No you didn't!
LEE	Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

LEE	Ricky Tan is alive.
CARTER	What?!?!
LEE	We have to get to the Penthouse.

CARTER	You go after Ricky.  I got this.
LEE	Carter...
CARTER	Just GO!

CARTER	Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
LEE	It's worth it to me.

CARTER	We made it, man.
LEE	No problem.

CARTER	I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
LEE	She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.

CARTER	That your gate down there?
LEE	Yes.
CARTER	I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
LEE	I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
CARTER	You take care of yourself, Lee.

CARTER	Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
LEE	It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

LEE	What is this?
CARTER	About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
LEE	No, Carter.  I can't take this.
CARTER	It's okay, I got lots more.

CARTER	They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
LEE	This money is evidence.
CARTER	Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.

LEE	I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
CARTER	New York City?
LEE	First class.
CARTER	The Plaza Hotel?
LEE	A little Mu-shu.
CARTER	Some Kung-Pao?

CARTER	I could use a little vacation.
LEE	Amen to that, brother.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
CARTER	What "revenge" is he talking about?
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
CARTER	Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
CARTER	Fine with me.

ISABELLA	I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
LEE	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.

LEE	Is this a payoff?
ISABELLA	No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?

ISABELLA	It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
LEE	And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
ISABELLA	Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.

ISABELLA	Put your arms around me.
LEE	Excuse me?

LEE	What's going on?
ISABELLA	I need your help.
LEE	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
ISABELLA	I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.

ISABELLA	You move well.
LEE	Just trying to make it look real.
ISABELLA	Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.

ISABELLA	Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
LEE	Why don't you go get them?
ISABELLA	If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

ISABELLA	The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
LEE	How do I know I can trust you?
ISABELLA	Dip me!

ISABELLA	I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
LEE	No.  But I'll help you.

LEE	Are you okay?
ISABELLA	I'm fine.

LEE	I didn't know which side you were on.
ISABELLA	Now you know.

KENNY	Master Ching taught me.
LEE	The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
KENNY	No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

KENNY	What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
LEE	Baby Duck?
KENNY	That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.

LEE	Do you still have the bills?
KENNY	I still have my lunch money from third grade.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
LEE	Any leads?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
LEE	It's my responsibility.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
LEE	The Secret Service?  Why?

LEE	All he wanted was some mu-shu.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Are you okay, Lee?

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
LEE	Did you tell Sterling?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
LEE	Thank you.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
LEE	I'll take him.

RICKY TAN	Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
LEE	You must come with me for questioning.

RICKY TAN	Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
LEE	Don't.

RICKY TAN	... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
LEE	The police can protect you.
RICKY TAN	Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
LEE	Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
RICKY TAN	There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...

RICKY TAN	You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
LEE	Put the plates down.  It's over.
RICKY TAN	I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.

LEE	If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
RICKY TAN	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

MASTER FU	Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
LEE	Yes, Master.

LEE	I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
MASTER FU	Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.

MASTER FU	He was the best I ever trained, you know.
LEE	Ricky Tan?
MASTER FU	No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --

MASTER FU	A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
LEE	I know, Master, but...
MASTER FU	The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
LEE	Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
MASTER FU	It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	This is still Hong Kong.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Who the hell is that?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.

MAN'S VOICE	You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
CARTER	Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".

CARTER	You know what a phone booth is?!
MAN'S VOICE	The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.

CARTER	Lee!  It's him!
MAN'S VOICE	The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
CARTER	Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
MAN'S VOICE	In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
CARTER	That's some serious poundage in dollars.

MAN'S VOICE	What is your name?
CARTER	That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
MAN'S VOICE	Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
CARTER	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
MAN'S VOICE	Shut up!
CARTER	OK. Say what it is.
MAN'S VOICE	The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.

DIEL	I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
CARTER	Sir, I can explain.
DIEL	What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
CARTER	I know, but --
DIEL	That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.

DIEL	Good job.
CARTER	Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
DIEL	I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.

CARTER	Feds asked for me?
DIEL	They asked for the best street man I had.

CARTER	And that, of course, would be me.
DIEL	Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.

CARTER	Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
WHITNEY	Carter.

CARTER	He stole my wheel!
WHITNEY	This is pathetic.
CARTER	I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!

WHITNEY	He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
CARTER	Tell me about it.
WHITNEY	He was just doing his job.
CARTER	So was I.

LEE	You talk very fast.
CARTER	Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.

LEE	Beach Boy.
CARTER	You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
LEE	Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --

LEE	Help me Rhonda.
CARTER	Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

CARTER	You have one of these?
LEE	No.
CARTER	Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.

CARTER	You speak English!
LEE	A little.
CARTER	Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
LEE	I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
CARTER	It's the same thing!
LEE	I am not responsible for your assumptions.
CARTER	You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
LEE	Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
CARTER	Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
LEE	We are both full of shit.
CARTER	Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.

LEE	I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
CARTER	Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.

CARTER	-- what the hell is that?
LEE	What?
CARTER	That silly-ass look on your face.
LEE	I was being polite.
CARTER	Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.

CARTER	Where were we?
LEE	Witnesses.
CARTER	Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.

LEE	I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
CARTER	Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!

CARTER	You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
LEE	It was not my intent --
CARTER	Right....
LEE	Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
CARTER	Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.

LEE	What about them?
CARTER	I know a shortcut.
LEE	Shortcut?
CARTER	You don't know what a shortcut is?

CARTER	You make the plate?
LEE	What plate?
CARTER	The license!  You get it?!
LEE	No.
CARTER	What the hell kinda cop are you?!
LEE	Did you make the plate?!
CARTER	It was my ass that almost got trashed!
LEE	He was trying to kill me, not you.
CARTER	Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
LEE	It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
CARTER	Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.

LEE	When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
CARTER	What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
LEE	No. I just made it up.

LEE	I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
CARTER	Don't go there...
LEE	I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
CARTER	Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
LEE	I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
CARTER	Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?

CARTER	Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
LEE	Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.

CARTER	When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
LEE	Stooly.
CARTER	What?
LEE	Stool pigeon.
CARTER	Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.

LEE	You talk too fast.
CARTER	Come on!

CARTER	Let's go.  Everybody take off?
LEE	Took off. Yes. They took off.

CARTER	You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
LEE	Thank you. I learn a great deal.
CARTER	It happens.

CARTER	Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
LEE	That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
CARTER	Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
LEE	Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.

LEE	You like it?
CARTER	Yeah, it's good.
LEE	That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.

LEE	You want more?
CARTER	No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.

CARTER	Now, that's American music.
LEE	Yes, I know this song.
CARTER	You know War?
LEE	Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²

CARTER	That's not how it goes.
LEE	Yes, I think so.
CARTER	No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
LEE	Yee-aww.

CARTER	Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
LEE	Good God, ya'll!
CARTER	No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.

LEE	Are you OK?
CARTER	I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.

LEE	Want some?
CARTER	No, fish is a PM food.
LEE	Excuse me?
CARTER	Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.

CARTER	What?!
LEE	It's him.

CARTER	Which one?
LEE	Going into the restaurant.

LEE	This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
CARTER	This concrete?  This is still America.
LEE	What do you hear?

CARTER	OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
LEE	I am from outa town.
CARTER	No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.

CARTER	Like that.
LEE	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

LEE	No, please, I don't --
CARTER	It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.

CARTER	No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
LEE	Oh yes.

LEE	Oh no, I dropped it.
CARTER	You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
LEE	I'm sorry.

CARTER	I'm sorry, Lee.
LEE	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.

LEE	What are you doing here?
CARTER	Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.

LEE	Oh no.
CARTER	What?
LEE	The art.

LEE	No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
CARTER	Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.

LEE	Oh my god. Griffin.
CARTER	You know him?

LEE	What a surprise!
CARTER	FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
LEE	It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
CARTER	No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
LEE	Oh, I think you like this very much.

CARTER	Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
JOHNSON	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

CARTER	Not anymore.
JOHNSON	Where'd you get it?

CARTER	You're killin' me here.
JOHNSON	Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
CARTER	Oh, baby, you cruel...

JOHNSON	Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
CARTER	Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.

CARTER	Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
JOHNSON	The Feds?!
CARTER	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.

CARTER	Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
JOHNSON	No...what?
CARTER	I could get promoted right out of here.
JOHNSON	What's wrong with that?
CARTER	I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?

CARTER	How'd what go?
JOHNSON	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?

CARTER	Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
JOHNSON	They put you in charge?
CARTER	In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
JOHNSON	Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
CARTER	Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
JOHNSON	OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.

JOHNSON	Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
CARTER	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.

JOHNSON	You got a lot of guts calling me.
CARTER	Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
JOHNSON	You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
CARTER	Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.

JOHNSON	Jesus...what do you want?
CARTER	This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
JOHNSON	This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
CARTER	Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?

CARTER	Oh my god...what happened to you?
JOHNSON	It's called a dress.
CARTER	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?

JOHNSON	Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
CARTER	What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
JOHNSON	Yeah, if you're Superfly.
CARTER	That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!

JOHNSON	You don't like it?
CARTER	It's okay. For restaurants.

CARTER	You OK?
JOHNSON	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
CARTER	Yeah. So why you look do down?
JOHNSON	Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
CARTER	Not to me. Never to me.

JOHNSON	How about a lift home?
CARTER	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.

CARTER	Any demands yet?
RUSS	At this point we don't have much.
CARTER	How much they want?
RUSS	You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
CARTER	Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.

RUSS	... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
CARTER	Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
RUSS	He is the situation.

CARTER	I'm talking about the girl.
RUSS	Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.

CARTER	What kind of assignment is that?
RUSS	Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
CARTER	Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
RUSS	Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
CARTER	What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
RUSS	Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.

RUSS	What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
CARTER	Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --

CARTER	You understand what I'm sayin'?
RUSS	Carter, shut up!

CARTER	Yo, Johnson...
RUSS	You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
CARTER	Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
RUSS	That's what you were supposed to be!

CARTER	Hmmmm?
RUSS	Don't play bullshit games with me.
CARTER	Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.

CARTER	Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
RUSS	Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
CARTER	No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.

CARTER	Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
RUSS	I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
CARTER	What?!
RUSS	And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.

CARTER	Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
LAFONTAINE	Shut up!
CARTER	You a cop or something?
LAFONTAINE	Or somethin'.

CARTER	This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
LAFONTAINE	I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
CARTER	I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
LAFONTAINE	Nobody touches me.
CARTER	Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?

CARTER	You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
LAFONTAINE	What are you talking about?

CARTER	What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
LAFONTAINE	I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

CARTER	Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
LAFONTAINE	Do it!

CARTER	You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
LAFONTAINE	What are you talking about?
CARTER	You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
LAFONTAINE	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
CARTER	All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.

LAFONTAINE	You sonuvabitch.
CARTER	I'm waitin' here for a name.

CARTER	Where do we find him?
LAFONTAINE	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.

HAN	Hello.
SANG'S VOICE	Ambassador Han.
HAN	Yes.
SANG'S VOICE	Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.

HAN	My daughter.
SANG'S VOICE	She's fine.
HAN	Can I speak with her?

HAN	Yes.
SANG'S VOICE	You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
HAN	Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --

HAN	Hello.
SANG'S VOICE	Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
HAN	I want to speak with my daughter!

HAN	Hello.
MAN'S VOICE	Han?
HAN	Yes.
MAN'S VOICE	It's Griffin.
HAN	Griffin?  Where are you.

HAN	Yes.
MAN'S VOICE	You have what I asked for?
HAN	I do.
MAN'S VOICE	Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.

HAN	I would like one of my people to help.
RUSS	Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
HAN	He is very good.
RUSS	As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.

HAN	I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
RUSS	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
HAN	He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.

HAN	Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
RUSS	Carter, can I have a moment?

HAN	I am so sorry about your men.
RUSS	Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
HAN	And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
RUSS	Don't worry, he's with Carter.

SOON YOUNG	When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
LEE	I still have work to do here.
SOON YOUNG	I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
LEE	I was trying to find the right time.
SOON YOUNG	After I left?

SOON YOUNG	I will not have friends in America.
LEE	Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.

CAPTAIN	I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
MILLS	Give it to me.
CAPTAIN	How's that?
MILLS	There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.

CAPTAIN	That's not necessary.  You're in.
MILLS	Thank you.
CAPTAIN	Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.

CAPTAIN	He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
MILLS	What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
CAPTAIN	So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.

CAPTAIN	You don't.  It goes to court now.
MILLS	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.

MILLS	He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
CAPTAIN	You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.

MILLS	How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
CAPTAIN	Ease back, Mills.

CAPTAIN	What do you think?
MILLS	I'm in.

SOMERSET	Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light. It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
CAPTAIN	Announcing what?
SOMERSET	There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
CAPTAIN	So what?  This victim...
SOMERSET	... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
CAPTAIN	Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
SOMERSET	One is gluttony.

CAPTAIN	What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
SOMERSET	This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
CAPTAIN	I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.

CAPTAIN	You've left unfinished business before.
SOMERSET	Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.

CAPTAIN	Have you heard?
SOMERSET	No, I haven't heard.
CAPTAIN	There was a second.

SOMERSET	Already.
CAPTAIN	Greed.  It was written in blood.

SOMERSET	It's none of my business anymore.
CAPTAIN	I thought you might want to be filled in.
SOMERSET	I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
CAPTAIN	Yeah.
SOMERSET	Good.

CAPTAIN	Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
SOMERSET	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
CAPTAIN	Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
SOMERSET	What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN	You know.

SOMERSET	Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
CAPTAIN	I heard.
SOMERSET	I have no understanding of this place anymore.
CAPTAIN	It's always been like this.
SOMERSET	Really?

CAPTAIN	Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
SOMERSET	He's not finished.

CAPTAIN	How you feeling?
SOMERSET	I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.

SOMERSET	Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
CAPTAIN	We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
SOMERSET	Yeah, that's true.

CAPTAIN	They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
SOMERSET	It would be too hard.

CAPTAIN	He's being arraigned tomorrow.
SOMERSET	I read about it in the paper.

CAPTAIN	I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
SOMERSET	I'll see you.

CRAZED MAN	And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
SOMERSET	Where was the girl?
CRAZED MAN	What?  What?
SOMERSET	Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?

CRAZED MAN	She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
SOMERSET	Who tied her down?  You or him?
CRAZED MAN	He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.

DELIVERYMAN	Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
SOMERSET	Turn around.  Hands on your head!
DELIVERYMAN	What the hell's going on?
SOMERSET	Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
DELIVERYMAN	I'm... I'm just delivering a package.

DELIVERYMAN	This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
SOMERSET	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
DELIVERYMAN	Okay...

SOMERSET	I don't believe it.
JOHN DOE	Hello.

JOHN DOE	What do you mean?
SOMERSET	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
JOHN DOE	It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.

SOMERSET	What's so exciting?
JOHN DOE	It's not too far away now.

JOHN DOE	What time is it?
SOMERSET	Why?

JOHN DOE	It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
SOMERSET	David... please...
JOHN DOE	I visited your home this morning, after you left.

SOMERSET	Give me the gun.
JOHN DOE	Her pretty head.

JOHN DOE	You didn't know.
SOMERSET	NO!

MILLS	Where we headed?
JOHN DOE	You'll see.

MILLS	We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
JOHN DOE	Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
MILLS	What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
JOHN DOE	Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
MILLS	I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
JOHN DOE	You know that's not true.
MILLS	In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.

JOHN DOE	You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
MILLS	Spit it out.
JOHN DOE	It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.

JOHN DOE	I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
MILLS	Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
JOHN DOE	Oh, don't worry. You won't...

JOHN DOE	I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
MILLS	Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
JOHN DOE	You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
MILLS	You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
JOHN DOE	Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
MILLS	Murderers?
JOHN DOE	A woman...
MILLS	Murderers like you?
JOHN DOE	A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
MILLS	Delusions of grandeur.
JOHN DOE	You should be thanking me.
MILLS	And, why is that?
JOHN DOE	You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
MILLS	We would have gotten you eventually.
JOHN DOE	Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?

JOHN DOE	Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
MILLS	I seem to remember knocking on your door.
JOHN DOE	And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
MILLS	Sit back.

MILLS	Just keep leading the way.
JOHN DOE	It's close.

JOHN DOE	I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
MILLS	What the fuck is going on here?!

JOHN DOE	You've made a good life for yourself...
MILLS	Shut up!

JOHN DOE	Here he comes.
MILLS	What the fuck is going on?
JOHN DOE	I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.

MILLS	Somerset...
JOHN DOE	Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.

MILLS	I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
SOMERSET	Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
MILLS	Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.

MILLS	I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
SOMERSET	I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
MILLS	I... I don't follow.
SOMERSET	All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
MILLS	I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.

SOMERSET	You just met me.
MILLS	Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
SOMERSET	It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
MILLS	Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
SOMERSET	Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
MILLS	I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
SOMERSET	Not here.
MILLS	I realize that.
SOMERSET	Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.

SOMERSET	I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
MILLS	And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
SOMERSET	Drop it.
MILLS	For now.

MILLS	Who said this was murder?
SOMERSET	No one yet.
MILLS	Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.

MILLS	When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
SOMERSET	Please be quiet for a while, would you?

MILLS	There's a bucket here.
SOMERSET	What?
MILLS	There's a bucket.  Under the table.

MILLS	It's a bucket of vomit.
SOMERSET	Is there any blood in it?
MILLS	I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?

MILLS	You think it was poison?
SOMERSET	Guessing at this point is useless.

MILLS	You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
SOMERSET	No.
MILLS	Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
SOMERSET	Good.
MILLS	The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
SOMERSET	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
MILLS	Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.

SOMERSET	Is that clear?
MILLS	Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
SOMERSET	I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.

SOMERSET	Same color and texture.
MILLS	Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?

MILLS	This doesn't make any sense.
SOMERSET	You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.

MILLS	It could be nothing.
SOMERSET	But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.

SOMERSET	He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
MILLS	This was one sadistic motherfucker.

MILLS	This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
SOMERSET	This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.

SOMERSET	I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
MILLS	Whoa, whoa... what?!

SOMERSET	It's too soon for him.
MILLS	Can we talk about this in private?

SOMERSET	It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
MILLS	Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?

MILLS	It's my wife.
SOMERSET	What?

MILLS	Well?
SOMERSET	I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
MILLS	How's that?
SOMERSET	Tonight.

MILLS	I'd like you to meet Somerset.
SOMERSET	Hello.

SOMERSET	All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
MILLS	What about sports?
SOMERSET	What about them?

MILLS	You go to movies at least?
SOMERSET	I read.  Remember reading?
MILLS	I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."

MILLS	You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
SOMERSET	I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.

MILLS	Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
SOMERSET	I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
MILLS	Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.

MILLS	The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
SOMERSET	All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
MILLS	He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.

SOMERSET	He must have left another puzzle piece.
MILLS	Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
SOMERSET	This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.

MILLS	Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
SOMERSET	And, if it's a threat.
MILLS	We put her in a safe house.

SOMERSET	He's preaching.
MILLS	Punishing.
SOMERSET	The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
MILLS	Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
SOMERSET	Did you read them?
MILLS	Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
SOMERSET	Seven Terraces of Purgation.
MILLS	Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
SOMERSET	For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
MILLS	Forced what?
SOMERSET	Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
MILLS	Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.

SOMERSET	No fingerprints?
MILLS	Nothing.
SOMERSET	Totally unrelated victims.

SOMERSET	No witnesses of any kind?
MILLS	None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.

SOMERSET	This is the one thing.
MILLS	I know.
SOMERSET	What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
MILLS	Okay.  But, what?

SOMERSET	You're sure your men didn't move this?
MILLS	Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.

MILLS	Nothing.
SOMERSET	It's got to be.

MILLS	What the fuck is that?
SOMERSET	A switchblade.

SOMERSET	There must be something.
MILLS	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.

MILLS	What?
SOMERSET	Bear with me.

MILLS	Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
SOMERSET	Just wait!

MILLS	Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
SOMERSET	No.

MILLS	He just may be nuts enough.
SOMERSET	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
MILLS	Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.

SOMERSET	You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
MILLS	And you don't?
SOMERSET	I wish I still thought like you.
MILLS	Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
SOMERSET	All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
MILLS	Oh, that's all.
SOMERSET	We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
MILLS	Bullshit.
SOMERSET	I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
MILLS	I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
SOMERSET	In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.

MILLS	Does this make it with you?
SOMERSET	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
MILLS	You tell me.  I'm new in town.
SOMERSET	He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
MILLS	The fingerprints.
SOMERSET	Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
MILLS	We'll tag along.

SOMERSET	Why would we?
MILLS	Satisfy our curiosity?

SOMERSET	Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
MILLS	Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
SOMERSET	And?
MILLS	It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.

SOMERSET	How did the fire fight end?
MILLS	I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.

SOMERSET	How was it?
MILLS	I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
SOMERSET	I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
MILLS	Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.

MILLS	It is Victor.
SOMERSET	Call an ambulance.

SOMERSET	The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
MILLS	I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
SOMERSET	Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
MILLS	No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
SOMERSET	We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
MILLS	I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
SOMERSET	He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.

MILLS	How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
SOMERSET	They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
MILLS	Sorry about that... I just...
SOMERSET	Oh, it's alright.

SOMERSET	Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
MILLS	A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
SOMERSET	Who pays the rent on time.

MILLS	I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
SOMERSET	This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
MILLS	There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
SOMERSET	It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
MILLS	Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
SOMERSET	It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
MILLS	Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
SOMERSET	No.
MILLS	Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
SOMERSET	No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
MILLS	We don't know for sure...
SOMERSET	Yes we do.  Here...

SOMERSET	This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
MILLS	And so what?
SOMERSET	Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
MILLS	Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
SOMERSET	Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
MILLS	What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.

SOMERSET	How much money do you have?
MILLS	I don't know... like fifty.

MILLS	Well, that was money well spent.
SOMERSET	Let's go.

SOMERSET	By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
MILLS	It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.

SOMERSET	It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
MILLS	Him?
SOMERSET	For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
MILLS	What?  Assessing fines?
SOMERSET	They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
MILLS	You got to be kidding.
SOMERSET	Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
MILLS	How is this legal?
SOMERSET	Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.

MILLS	So they ran our list.
SOMERSET	If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
MILLS	Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
SOMERSET	Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
MILLS	How do you know all about this?
SOMERSET	I don't.  Neither do you.

MILLS	This is a waste of time.
SOMERSET	We're focusing.
MILLS	I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
SOMERSET	The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.

MILLS	Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
SOMERSET	It's not what you think it is.
MILLS	The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
SOMERSET	That is.
MILLS	The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
SOMERSET	Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

MILLS	You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
SOMERSET	That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
MILLS	This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
SOMERSET	We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
MILLS	Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.

MILLS	What are you going to say?
SOMERSET	You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
MILLS	Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?

SOMERSET	Are you alright?
MILLS	I'm fine.
SOMERSET	What happened?

SOMERSET	Wait... just wait.
MILLS	It was him.
SOMERSET	You can't go in there.

MILLS	The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
SOMERSET	We need a warrant.
MILLS	We have probable cause now.

SOMERSET	Think about it...
MILLS	What the fuck is wrong with you?
SOMERSET	Think about how we got here!

MILLS	By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
SOMERSET	Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
MILLS	Okay... okay... get off.

SOMERSET	You stupid son of a...
MILLS	No point in arguing anymore...

SOMERSET	What are you talking about?
MILLS	We had him.

SOMERSET	We could use about fifty more men here.
MILLS	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.

SOMERSET	Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
MILLS	Then, he must write about these murders.
SOMERSET	What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended.

SOMERSET	No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
MILLS	Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.

MILLS	He's preaching.
SOMERSET	These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.

SOMERSET	The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
MILLS	Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
SOMERSET	One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.

SOMERSET	You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
MILLS	If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
SOMERSET	No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
MILLS	How can you say that?  Especially after today?
SOMERSET	Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
MILLS	You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
SOMERSET	You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
MILLS	You do your job...
SOMERSET	Where's the victory?
MILLS	You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
SOMERSET	Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
MILLS	Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.

MILLS	You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
SOMERSET	People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
MILLS	What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
SOMERSET	It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
MILLS	Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
SOMERSET	Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
MILLS	You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
SOMERSET	No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
MILLS	Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
SOMERSET	That part of me is dead.

MILLS	He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
SOMERSET	Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.

MILLS	Oh, you want to stay now?
SOMERSET	One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
MILLS	You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
SOMERSET	I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.

MILLS	You knew I'd say yes.
SOMERSET	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.

SOMERSET	As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
MILLS	Big surprise.

SOMERSET	Because he is John Doe, by choice.
MILLS	When do we get to question him?

MILLS	You know he's fucking us.
SOMERSET	You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
MILLS	Well... what the fuck, man?
SOMERSET	He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?

MILLS	No.
SOMERSET	I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.

SOMERSET	If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
MILLS	I will.

SOMERSET	What is it?
MILLS	Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
SOMERSET	Slut.
MILLS	Kiss me on the lips.
SOMERSET	Give me a break.

SOMERSET	Stay with him.
MILLS	Wait!
SOMERSET	There's no time to discuss it!

SOMERSET	Throw your gun down now!
MILLS	What are you talking about?  What happened?

SOMERSET	Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
MILLS	What did you say?

MILLS	Tell me it's not true.
SOMERSET	I can't let you do this...

MILLS	Put your gun down!!
SOMERSET	Don't do this... please...
MILLS	Put the gun down, Somerset!

MILLS	I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
MRS GOULD	I... I don't understand.

MILLS	I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
MRS GOULD	I don't know why... why now?
MILLS	Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.

MILLS	Anything... anything missing or different.
MRS GOULD	I don't see anything.
MILLS	Are you absolutely certain?
MRS GOULD	I can't do this now... please.

MRS GOULD	This painting...
MILLS	What?
MRS GOULD	Why is this painting hanging upside-down?

TRACY	It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
SOMERSET	Oh... um, William.
TRACY	It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.

SOMERSET	It smells good.
TRACY	What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.

SOMERSET	I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
TRACY	High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
SOMERSET	Really?

SOMERSET	Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
TRACY	No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.

TRACY	You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
SOMERSET	I guess I won't be showing it to him then.

SOMERSET	I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
TRACY	It surprises me.  It really does.
SOMERSET	Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.

TRACY	How long have you lived here?
SOMERSET	Too long.  What do you think so far?

SOMERSET	I don't know, with this case.
TRACY	If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.

TRACY	I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
SOMERSET	It's a hard place.
TRACY	I don't sleep very well.

SOMERSET	I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
TRACY	I'm sorry, I only...

TRACY	Perfect example.
SOMERSET	You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
TRACY	I don't know why I asked you to come.
SOMERSET	Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
TRACY	I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
SOMERSET	He mentioned it.

TRACY	I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
SOMERSET	You should look into private schools.
TRACY	I don't know...

SOMERSET	Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
TRACY	I hate this city.

SOMERSET	Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
TRACY	I want to have children.  It's just...
SOMERSET	I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.

TAYLOR	Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
SOMERSET	Did the wife confess?
TAYLOR	When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.

SOMERSET	Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
TAYLOR	Crime of passion.
SOMERSET	Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
TAYLOR	This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.

SOMERSET	Did their son see it happen?
TAYLOR	I don't know.

ACE	You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
JOHNNY	What an honor...
ACE	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !

ACE	What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Something... I've got...you don't.
ACE	You rich kids... are all the same !
JOHNNY	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!

JOHNNY	Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
ACE	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
JOHNNY	Well, maybe you better look again.

ACE	Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
JOHNNY	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

ACE	Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
JOHNNY	It's what I deserve.
ACE	Whad'ya talkin  about ?
JOHNNY	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
ACE	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.

ACE	I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
JOHNNY	What do I want with a scar ?

ACE	No, this hurts.
JOHNNY	YAAAAAAAA !

ACE	Mobile Infantery rules !
JOHNNY	Death to all bugs !

JOHNNY	Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
ACE	I didn't see him !

ACE	Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
JOHNNY	He was our teacher... He was great.
ACE	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.

ACE	No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
JOHNNY	What about it, Diz ?

ACE	Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
JOHNNY	Not enough, I guess.

ACE	We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
JOHNNY	We're the old men, Ace.

JOHNNY	We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
ACE	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
JOHNNY	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...

JOHNNY	Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
ACE	Yes, sir !

JOHNNY	Saddle up, Roughnecks !
ACE	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !

C.O.	Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
C.O.	Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Sir, no, sir.
C.O.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
JOHNNY	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.

C.O.	Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
JOHNNY	Sir... I guess I do, sir.

JOHNNY	Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
C.O.	Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
JOHNNY	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.

CARL	You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
JOHNNY	What's the hurry ?
CARL	Others are waiting.

JOHNNY	Did you read her mind ?
CARL	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.

JOHNNY	Yeah, but I want Carmen.
CARL	You got it bad.

CARL	Don't think about it... go on instinct.
JOHNNY	Ace of spades.

CARL	Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
JOHNNY	In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

JOHNNY	How do you make him do that ?
CARL	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

JOHNNY	Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
CARL	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
JOHNNY	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
CARL	Your father will never let you.
JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
CARL	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
JOHNNY	Eight point... no, uh, seven...
CARL	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
JOHNNY	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
CARL	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.

JOHNNY	I don't believe it !
CARL	I got Games & Theory.

CARL	Please continue, Sergeant.
JOHNNY	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.

CARL	Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
JOHNNY	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
CARL	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.

CARL	You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
JOHNNY	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.

CARL	Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
JOHNNY	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
CARL	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
JOHNNY	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.

JOHNNY	You always told me you couldn't do human...
CARL	I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...

CARMEN	Are you alright ?
ZANDER	I'm getting better.

ZANDER	So what are you doing later ?
CARMEN	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
ZANDER	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

ZANDER	I'm all ears.
CARMEN	Don't you have to finish the game ?

CARMEN	Johnny, this is Zander.
ZANDER	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

CARMEN	Hey ! What are you doing here ?
ZANDER	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.

CARMEN	Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
ZANDER	Only when I give you an order.

CARMEN	It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
ZANDER	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...

CARMEN	In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
ZANDER	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
CARMEN	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
ZANDER	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.

CARMEN	Or...?
ZANDER	They revoke our flight status.
CARMEN	Oh, I see... teamwork.

CARMEN	Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
ZANDER	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.

ZANDER	Profile's wrong... there.
CARMEN	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
ZANDER	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
CARMEN	Hey, check it.

ZANDER	You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
CARMEN	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
ZANDER	Well, whad'ya know...
CARMEN	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
ZANDER	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
CARMEN	You and me, huh ?

CARMEN	I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
ZANDER	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.

CARMEN	WHERE IS IT ?
CARMEN	It looks like an... asteroid.

ZANDER	Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
CARMEN	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.

CARMEN	Johnny, wait...
ZANDER	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.

ZANDER	Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
CARMEN	Zander, please... Let's go !

ZANDER	I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
CARMEN	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
ZANDER	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
CARMEN	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
ZANDER	So ?
CARMEN	So who's got time to get married ?

ZANDER	Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
CARMEN	Funny...
ZANDER	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
CARMEN	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
ZANDER	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.

ZANDER	Carmen...?
CARMEN	Excuse me...!

ZANDER	I'm sorry, Carmen.
CARMEN	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...

CARMEN	No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
ZANDER	You're upset, that's alright.

ZANDER	Where are you going ?
CARMEN	A funeral.
ZANDER	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
CARMEN	Yeah.
ZANDER	How do you feel about him now ?
CARMEN	I don't know, Zander.
ZANDER	I do.

CARMEN	I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
ZANDER	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
CARMEN	Is it true ?

CARMEN	Zander, what are you doing ?
ZANDER	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
CARMEN	Zander, no...!

JOHNNY	Good for you.
CARMEN	Your turn...

CARMEN	She's flying starships !
JOHNNY	Who ?
CARMEN	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
JOHNNY	I have good reflexes.

CARMEN	Eeuch !
JOHNNY	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

JOHNNY	Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
CARMEN	Excuse me...!

JOHNNY	35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
CARMEN	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
JOHNNY	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
CARMEN	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
JOHNNY	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
CARMEN	I don't want everyone to see.
JOHNNY	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
CARMEN	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
JOHNNY	It's all I think about anymore.

CARMEN	You can't walk me home.
JOHNNY	Why not ?
CARMEN	I thought you were going to help Carl.
JOHNNY	Carl can wait.
CARMEN	Johnny, my Dad's home today.

JOHNNY	What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
CARMEN	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
JOHNNY	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
CARMEN	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?

JOHNNY	Isn't it great to be in love ?
CARMEN	How do I know if this is love ?
JOHNNY	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

CARMEN	Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
JOHNNY	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.

JOHNNY	Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
CARMEN	I'll meet you outside.

JOHNNY	None at all... We won.
CARMEN	Good luck at the academy.

CARMEN	He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
JOHNNY	Yeah, sure, I guess.
CARMEN	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
JOHNNY	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
CARMEN	Zander is going for pilot, too.
JOHNNY	You two have so much in common.

CARMEN	Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
JOHNNY	I can't help it.
CARMEN	He's nothing like you.
JOHNNY	I don't even know if you're my girl.

CARMEN	Are you the boy for me ?
JOHNNY	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.

CARMEN	Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
JOHNNY	Who cares ?
CARMEN	You're right. Let's never stop...

JOHNNY	I love you, Carmen.
CARMEN	Shhh...

CARMEN	I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
JOHNNY	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

JOHNNY	He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
CARMEN	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

CARMEN	Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
JOHNNY	Did you get Starside R&D ?

CARMEN	Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
JOHNNY	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !

CARMEN	Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
JOHNNY	I'll go for that.

JOHNNY	You're late.
CARMEN	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

CARMEN	Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
JOHNNY	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?

CARMEN	You talk to Carl ?
JOHNNY	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

JOHNNY	I'm gonna miss you.
CARMEN	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
JOHNNY	I love you.

JOHNNY	Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
CARMEN	Alright, I love you.

JOHNNY	Do you mean it ?
CARMEN	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !

JOHNNY	Shhhh...!
CARMEN	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.

JOHNNY	What happened to your hair ?
CARMEN	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
JOHNNY	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?

CARMEN	It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
JOHNNY	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
CARMEN	You don't look very happy to see me.
JOHNNY	Should I be ?
CARMEN	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.

CARMEN	What's wrong with you ?
JOHNNY	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.

CARMEN	Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
JOHNNY	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !

CARMEN	...I'm sorry.
JOHNNY	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
CARMEN	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.

CARMEN	I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
JOHNNY	That was just a mix up.
CARMEN	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
JOHNNY	What happened to your eye ?

CARMEN	Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
JOHNNY	I like it. It's kinda...you.

CARMEN	Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
JOHNNY	How are you, Carl ?

CARMEN	Take care, wilya Johnny ?
JOHNNY	See you on the bounce !

CARMEN	AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
JOHNNY	We've gotta go get her !

CARMEN	Which way ?
JOHNNY	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.

CARMEN	Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
DELADIER	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
CARMEN	Yes, ma'am !

DELADIER	Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
CARMEN	Yes, ma'am.

DELADIER	Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
CARMEN	Thank you, ma'am.

CARMEN	Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
DELADIER	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?

CARMEN	Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
DELADIER	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.

CARMEN	This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
DELADIER	Ibanez...LET'S GO !

DELADIER	Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
CARMEN	No way, ma'am !

DELADIER	Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
ZANDER	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...

DELADIER	Report.
ZANDER	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...

DELADIER	Where'd it come from ?
ZANDER	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
DELADIER	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

DELADIER	This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
ZANDER	That's it, we're empty ma'am !

JOHNNY	A lot can happen in three minutes.
DIZZY	Hut... hut !

JOHNNY	What ?
DIZZY	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
JOHNNY	Just throw me the ball, Diz.

DIZZY	Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
JOHNNY	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
DIZZY	Too bad for her if she's not around.

JOHNNY	You still gonna play for Brazil ?
DIZZY	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
JOHNNY	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
DIZZY	How come we never got together ?

JOHNNY	Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
DIZZY	Sure.
JOHNNY	Uh, look, Diz...
DIZZY	Guess you gotta go.
JOHNNY	You're the best.

DIZZY	Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
JOHNNY	No thanks, Diz.
DIZZY	What's your malfunction, Rico ?
JOHNNY	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
DIZZY	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
JOHNNY	You saying you didn't ?

JOHNNY	Man, they're defended... no way in.
DIZZY	Flip six, three hole.
JOHNNY	What ?
DIZZY	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...

JOHNNY	Cover me.
DIZZY	You got it.

DIZZY	It stinks, you goin.
JOHNNY	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
DIZZY	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
JOHNNY	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.

JOHNNY	Well, see ya.
DIZZY	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
JOHNNY	What's that, Diz ?
DIZZY	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !

DIZZY	Way to go, amigo !
JOHNNY	I'm gonna need a squad leader.

DIZZY	C'mon...
JOHNNY	Nah, I don't do that anymore...
DIZZY	You used to dance...
JOHNNY	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
DIZZY	Well, excuse me, sir...

JOHNNY	Hey, Diz...
DIZZY	What ?

DIZZY	Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
JOHNNY	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.

JOHNNY	Diz, see what you can do.
DIZZY	I'm on it !

DIZZY	What frequency ?
JOHNNY	All bands.
DIZZY	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...

DIZZY	I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
JOHNNY	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
DIZZY	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...

MOTHER	Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
FATHER	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.

MOTHER	Good good, then it's all settled.
FATHER	A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.

MOTHER	Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
FATHER	Teenagers !

FATHER	...CUT OFF !
MOTHER	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

FATHER	Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
MOTHER	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
FATHER	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.

MOTHER	Oh, my, what's that ?
FATHER	Looks like rain.
MOTHER	This time of the year...?

FATHER	This came for you today. I presume on your request.
JOHNNY	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

FATHER	Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
JOHNNY	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.

JOHNNY	Mr. Rasczak.
FATHER	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
JOHNNY	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
FATHER	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
FATHER	Oh, is that how it is ?

FATHER	A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
JOHNNY	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.

JOHNNY	Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
FATHER	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

FATHER	You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
JOHNNY	I won't quit !
FATHER	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
JOHNNY	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.

FATHER	Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
JOHNNY	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.

RASCZAK	We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
GILLESPIE	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?

RASCZAK	Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
GILLESPIE	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
RASCZAK	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?

GILLESPIE	I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
RASCZAK	Keep trying, Sergeant.

RASCZAK	Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
GILLESPIE	AAAAAAAAAAA !

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
RASCZAK	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
RASCZAK	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
RASCZAK	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !

JOHNNY	Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
SUGAR WATKINS	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
JOHNNY	I wouldn't mind.

JOHNNY	I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
SUGAR WATKINS	Good luck. It's not there anymore.

SUGAR WATKINS	You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
JOHNNY	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
SUGAR WATKINS	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
JOHNNY	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.

ZIM	Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
JOHNNY	Sir, thank you, sir !
ZIM	Don't stand there dumb... GO !

ZIM	The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir !

ZIM	Is that your signature, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes it is, sir.
ZIM	Doesn't look like it to me.

PSYCH OFFICER	No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
JOHNNY	Here in Buenos Aires.

PSYCH OFFICER	Are your parents currently citizens ?
JOHNNY	No, sir.
PSYCH OFFICER	Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
JOHNNY	Courage, I guess.
PSYCH OFFICER	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
JOHNNY	I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.

MOTHER	Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
JOHNNY	Aw, don't get mushy.

MOTHER	Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
JOHNNY	Uh, no.

JOHNNY	I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
MOTHER	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
JOHNNY	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !

JOHNNY	Well, yeah, sure...
MOTHER	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

MOTHER	Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
JOHNNY	Hi, mom.
MOTHER	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...

MOTHER	Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
JOHNNY	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...

JOHNNY	Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
ZANDER	You can never be sure.

ZANDER	Best in the Fleet !
JOHNNY	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?

JOHNNY	You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
ZANDER	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
JOHNNY	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.

ZANDER	On whose authority, Corporal ?
JOHNNY	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.

JOHNNY	You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
ZANDER	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
JOHNNY	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -

ZANDER	Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
JOHNNY	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

JOHNNY	What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
ZANDER	The Rodger Young just burned up...

JOHNNY	We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
ZANDER	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-

ZANDER	What do you think you're doing ?
JOHNNY	I'm gonna save Carmen.
ZANDER	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
JOHNNY	Yeah, that's right.

ZANDER	Let's go.
JOHNNY	Move out.

JOHNNY	Can you walk ?
ZANDER	Not a problem.
JOHNNY	Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !

JOHNNY	How bad are you, pal ?
ZANDER	Been better, buddy.

JOHNNY	Alright, we're gonna carry you...
ZANDER	Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.

JOHNNY	Don't be a hero...
ZANDER	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...

RODGER YOUNG	This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
JOHNNY	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
RODGER YOUNG	What is your position ?
JOHNNY	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
RODGER YOUNG	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
JOHNNY	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !

RASCZAK	You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
JOHNNY	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
RASCZAK	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
JOHNNY	Uh, I don't know.
RASCZAK	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.

JOHNNY	Mister Rasczak ?
RASCZAK	What is it, Rico ?
JOHNNY	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
RASCZAK	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
JOHNNY	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
RASCZAK	Good for you. Go find out.
JOHNNY	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
RASCZAK	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.

RASCZAK	Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
JOHNNY	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
RASCZAK	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.

JOHNNY	All dead except one, sir.
RASCZAK	Kill the bitch.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir.

RASCZAK	Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
JOHNNY	Yes, sir...
RASCZAK	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?

RASCZAK	Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
RASCZAK	Who's that with you ?

RASCZAK	Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir.

RASCZAK	What's that look like to you, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

RASCZAK	Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
JOHNNY	What's going on, Diz ?

RASCZAK	Sergeant, secure the boat !
JOHNNY	Yes, sir !

RASCZAK	AAAAAAAAAAAA !
JOHNNY	Cover us, Ace !

JOHNNY	Hit your jets, sir !
RASCZAK	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...

RASCZAK	Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
JOHNNY	We're not leaving you here, sir !

RASCZAK	This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
JOHNNY	Give'em hell, sir !

CLARK	Jimmy, how's the -
JIMMY	Yeah. I'll check.

CLARK	Anybody been hurt?
JIMMY	So far the hostages are unharmed.
CLARK	Hostages?
JIMMY	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.

JIMMY	Are you okay?
CLARK	She'll be fine.

CLARK	Lois, I usually do.
LOIS	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.

CLARK	Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
LOIS	Do I detect a note of jealousy?

CLARK	Lois, what are you doing?
LOIS	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
CLARK	Uh. . .
LOIS	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
CLARK	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
LOIS	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.

CLARK	I don't?
LOIS	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
CLARK	I do?
LOIS	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
CLARK	Actually, yes.
LOIS	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.

CLARK	Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
LOIS	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
CLARK	Maybe I could try --
LOIS	Be my guest.

LOIS	Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
CLARK	Really?
LOIS	Of course, that's what friends are for.

CLARK	It is kinda romantic.
LOIS	In July???

CLARK	'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
LOIS	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
CLARK	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.

LOIS	Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.

CLARK	A "complimentary corsage."
LOIS	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.

CLARK	I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
LOIS	Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."

CLARK	I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
LOIS	That's because you can hardly see through those things.

LOIS	Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
CLARK	Lois, you're amazing.
LOIS	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
CLARK	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
LOIS	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.

LOIS	Where were you?
CLARK	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
LOIS	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
CLARK	Superman? Oh, was he here?
LOIS	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?

CLARK	Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
LOIS	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
CLARK	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.

CLARK	Who ????
LOIS	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
CLARK	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --

CLARK	You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
LOIS	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
CLARK	How could you win a crazy bet like --

LOIS	Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
CLARK	What??

LOIS	Oh Clark, no!
CLARK	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !

LOIS	It's true. It's true.
CLARK	Lois, I . . .
LOIS	I was right. you are Superman.
CLARK	Oh come on, that's ridic -

LOIS	Maybe you wanted to.
CLARK	I didn't think I wanted to.
LOIS	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .

LOIS	I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
CLARK	We'd better talk.
LOIS	I'm listening.
CLARK	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
LOIS	What's happening. Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
CLARK	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.

LOIS	I want to.
CLARK	Let's go to my place.

CLARK	Let's go to my place.
LOIS	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.

LOIS	You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
CLARK	Say you love me.

LOIS	Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
CLARK	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?

CLARK	Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
LOIS	Let's get you inside . . . .

CLARK	Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
LOIS	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
CLARK	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .

CLARK	I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
LOIS	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
CLARK	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .

LOIS	Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
CLARK	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.

CLARK	Hi.
LOIS	Oh, hi.

CLARK	Sleep well?
LOIS	Never closed my eyes.

LOIS	I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
CLARK	I'm sorry.
LOIS	Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
CLARK	You're not selfish at all.
LOIS	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.

CLARK	They?
LOIS	Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
CLARK	What else could I do?
LOIS	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
CLARK	Lois, someday --
LOIS	Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
CLARK	I like worrying about you.

LOIS	See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
CLARK	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
LOIS	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?

LOIS	. . . Superman?. . . . .
CLARK	Lois, I really don't see why --
LOIS	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.

CLARK	I'll try to remember that . . .
LOIS	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
CLARK	You do?
LOIS	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --

CLARK	Everything on it?
LOIS	Everything on it.

PERRY	Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
CLARK	Uh...home...
PERRY	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
CLARK	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
PERRY	Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!

CLARK	But . . ..that's terrible!
PERRY	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
CLARK	Does Lois know about this yet?
PERRY	Does she know about it? She's in it!
CLARK	What??
PERRY	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.

CLARK	Gee. But --
PERRY	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
CLARK	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.

EVE	Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
LUTHOR	What else is ballast for?
LUTHOR	How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
EVE	There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
LUTHOR	You'll have to pack quickly.
EVE	A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
LUTHOR	A parka.
EVE	You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
LUTHOR	North!

LUTHOR	Mush!  Mush!
EVE	Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
LUTHOR	A good time! Is that all you care about?!
EVE	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.

EVE	I like trees.
LUTHOR	So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.

LUTHOR	You'll miss the battle of the century!
EVE	Good. My heart can't take it.
LUTHOR	Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.

LEX	Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
EVE	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
LEX	Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.

EVE	This way Lex.
LEX	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
EVE	Genius!  --  Lex.
LEX	I'll be alright.
EVE	No, me, me, me. Thank you.
LEX	It's beautiful.
EVE	It's beautiful.

LEX	It has everything.
EVE	Wrong.
LEX	Why didn't you go before we left?
EVE	That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
LEX	It's beautiful.

SECOND CONTROLLER	Artemis? Do you read me?
FIRST CONTROLLER	What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
SECOND CONTROLLER	I think he said a "curl."
FIRST CONTROLLER	What's a curl?
SECOND CONTROLLER	Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
FIRST CONTROLLER	How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.

JIMMY	Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.

JIMMY	A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
PERRY	He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?

PERRY	I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
JIMMY	Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
PERRY	Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
JIMMY	Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?

LARA	You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
SUPERMAN	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?

LARA	You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
SUPERMAN	Yes, but it's not all I feel.
LARA	Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
LARA	Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
SUPERMAN	But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?

LARA	And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
SUPERMAN	Yes.

LARA	-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
LUTHOR	Now This I want to hear.
LARA	For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
LUTHOR	My kind of people.
LARA	The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
LUTHOR	Sensible enough.
LARA	And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
LUTHOR	No possibility for parole?
LARA	The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
LUTHOR	I asked the right question.
LARA	The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
LUTHOR	I didn't ask her anything . . .

OTIS	Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
LEX	I want my Liberace record back tonight.
OTIS	 DELETE IN CUTTING

LEX	DELETE IN CUTTING
OTIS	I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
LEX	Where?
OTIS	North.
LEX	Why?
OTIS	To ski?
OTIS	Oh! That black box in our cell?
LEX	Shhhhhhh!
OTIS	That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
LEX	That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
OTIS	Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.

LEX	Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
ZOD	We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
LEX	Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.

LEX	No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
ZOD	The son of Jor-El on this Planet?

LEX	Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
ZOD	Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!

ZOD	He flies as well, then . . .
LEX	Constantly.
ZOD	He has powers as we do . . .
LEX	Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
ZOD	We will bring him to his knees!

LEX	Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
ZOD	What do you want?
LEX	Australia.

LOIS	Superman! The --
SUPERMAN	Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
LOIS	The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --

SUPERMAN	You must be freezing.
LOIS	I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
SUPERMAN	Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.

SUPERMAN	So --  I hope you like it.
LOIS	Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
SUPERMAN	Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.

SUPERMAN	I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
LOIS	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.

LOIS	It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
SUPERMAN	Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
LOIS	But him is you.  Now I'm confused.

SUPERMAN	Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
LUTHOR	Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
SUPERMAN	I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .

LUTHOR	Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
SUPERMAN	Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .

SUPERMAN	I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
LUTHOR	Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
SUPERMAN	Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
LUTHOR	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .

SUPERMAN	Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
LUTHOR	Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --

ZOD	He ran in fear from us . . .

ZOD	Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
LUTHOR	Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .

ZOD	What more?
LUTHOR	Cuba.

LUTHOR	No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
ZOD	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
LUTHOR	North. Keep going North!

ZOD	Put down Lex Luthor !
LUTHOR	Put down Lex Luthor?

LUTHOR	Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
ZOD	Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.

ZOD	It will. Starting with your own.

ZOD	Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
PRESIDENT	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
ZOD	Zod.  Zod.

ZOD	Who is this . . . Superman?
PRESIDENT	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
ZOD	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!

SECOND REPORTER	And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
SPOKESMAN	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
SECOND REPORTER	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
SPOKESMAN	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
SECOND REPORTER	Yes, but will you honor it?
SPOKESMAN	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.

ZOD	Free!
URSA	Free!

URSA	Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
ZOD	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!

ZOD	Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
ZOD	And I will lead.

ZOD	So this is the planet Houston . . .
URSA	What shall we do now?
ZOD	Stay. I will come to you.

URSA	Look, they need a machine to fly.
ZOD	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.

URSA	You are master of all you survey.
ZOD	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.

ZOD	This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
URSA	Yes?
ZOD	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
URSA	Sentimental idiot.

URSA	He's captured Non!
ZOD	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.

URSA	General --- ?
ZOD	We must combine our strength.

ZOD	Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
URSA	Super-sucker .  For once, Lex Luthor was right.

ALBERT	I know, but  --
LUTHOR	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?

LUTHOR	You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
ALBERT	Bunkers!
LUTHOR	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!

ALBERT	There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
LUTHOR	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.

LUTHOR	Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
ALBERT	Nobody else.
LUTHOR	Shut up, apple-polisher.

LUTHOR	That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
ALBERT	He's thirty-five years old.
LUTHOR	You're a great architect, Albert.
ALBERT	Thank you.
LUTHOR	Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --

LUTHOR	Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
ALBERT	We're running out of smoke.

ALBERT	But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
LUTHOR	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!

ALBERT	It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
LUTHOR	Albert!
ALBERT	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --

ALBERT	Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
LUTHOR	One of them should've been you.
ALBERT	Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
LUTHOR	Got it? Otis?

ALBERT	Me?
LUTHOR	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.

JIMMY	You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
CLARK	I've been on the job.
JIMMY	A hot story, huh?
CLARK	It was hot, yes.
JIMMY	You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
CLARK	Lois isn't here?
JIMMY	She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
CLARK	What's she doing in California?
JIMMY	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.

MARTHA	Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
CLARK	No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
MARTHA	I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...

CLARK	Don't worry, Mom. I know.
MARTHA	Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.

CLARK	Mom...
MARTHA	I know.

CLARK	I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
MARTHA	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.

CLARK	Mother...
MARTHA	I know son, I know...

MARTHA	Do you know where you're headed?
CLARK	North. It's north

MARTHA	Keep warm now.
CLARK	I will.

CLARK	I'd like to.
LOIS	Well!

CLARK	I'll bet you have some good ideas.
LOIS	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.

LOIS	Your bookie?
CLARK	No.
LOIS	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
CLARK	Actually, she's silver-haired.
LOIS	Not...gray.
CLARK	Not really, no.

LOIS	Are there any more at home like you?
CLARK	Not really, no.

LOIS	Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
CLARK	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
LOIS	Some people aren't the athletic type.
CLARK	But otherwise it's swell.
LOIS	'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?

LOIS	See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
CLARK	Unbelievable.
LOIS	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --

LOIS	Hey!
CLARK	What the  --  !

LOIS	Stop him, Clark!
CLARK	He may have a gun!
LOIS	Oh, for God's sake!

CLARK	It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
LOIS	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
CLARK	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --

CLARK	Know what?
LOIS	You described the exact contents of my purse.
CLARK	I just took a shot at it.

LOIS	What now, my love?
CLARK	Huh?
LOIS	Big night coming up?
CLARK	Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
LOIS	Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
CLARK	Oh.
LOIS	It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
CLARK	Don't you ever give up?

LOIS	For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
CLARK	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
LOIS	There's no real proof that tobacco  --
CLARK	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.

CLARK	Can I take you to the airport?
LOIS	Not unless you can fly.
CLARK	Come again?

LOIS	I'm telling you, I was there.
CLARK	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
LOIS	It wasn't a trick!
CLARK	Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
LOIS	Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
CLARK	It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
LOIS	There weren't any wires. I looked.
CLARK	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
LOIS	He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
CLARK	Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
LOIS	Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
CLARK	I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
LOIS	You're just jealous.
CLARK	Jealous? Of what?
LOIS	Of this...Superman.

CLARK	What'd you call him?
LOIS	Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
CLARK	Is that what they're calling him?
LOIS	They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
CLARK	Super...man. Hmmm...
LOIS	It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
CLARK	No thanks.

LOIS	Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
CLARK	You're not the only one.
LOIS	Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...

SUPERMAN	Listen...thank you.
EVE	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?

SUPERMAN	You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
EVE	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
SUPERMAN	What are you doing here?
EVE	Screaming
SUPERMAN	Besides that.
EVE	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
SUPERMAN	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
EVE	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
SUPERMAN	I'd better get you down.

EVE	Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
SUPERMAN	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
EVE	Oh.
SUPERMAN	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
EVE	What can I tell you? He's my leader.
SUPERMAN	Okay.  Take me to your leader.

EVE	You and your real estate.
LUTHOR	Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
EVE	It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
LUTHOR	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.

EVE	Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
LUTHOR	My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
EVE	Your father was a sick weirdo.
LUTHOR	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
EVE	This??
LUTHOR	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
EVE	So I've noticed.
LUTHOR	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
EVE	Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
LUTHOR	You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
EVE	Even that would be an improvement.

EVE	Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
LUTHOR	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?

EVE	Again???
LUTHOR	First the pets, Otis.

LUTHOR	I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
EVE	You think he's for real?
LUTHOR	He's from another world.

LUTHOR	Nuts. He made it.
EVE	Tough guy, huh?

EVE	Bet he makes it.
LUTHOR	You're on.

LUTHOR	Shut up.
EVE	I didn't say a word.

LUTHOR	Damn!  This will get him.
EVE	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,

LUTHOR	What's the temperature now?
EVE	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
LUTHOR	When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.

LUTHOR	Krypton!
EVE	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?

LUTHOR	Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
EVE	I read the article.
LUTHOR	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.

EVE	See?
LUTHOR	See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
EVE	I'm going to bed.
LUTHOR	Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.

EVE	Mr. Romance...
LUTHOR	Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?

EVE	Meteorites!
LUTHOR	Bingo!

LUTHOR	Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
EVE	I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
LUTHOR	Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
EVE	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
LUTHOR	No, you're going to get kissed,

LUTHOR	Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
EVE	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.

EVE	You're happy, aren't you?
LUTHOR	La de da da...
EVE	You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?

LUTHOR	The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
EVE	We just take it?
LUTHOR	What do you suggest, my dear?
EVE	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.

LUTHOR	About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
EVE	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
LUTHOR	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
EVE	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
LUTHOR	Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.

LUTHOR	Ready?
EVE	Ready.

LUTHOR	They stop for nothing.
EVE	But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
LUTHOR	Nothing.

LUTHOR	Don't let me down.
EVE	You?! How about me?
LUTHOR	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.

LUTHOR	No news is not good news. Y'know
EVE	There was a recipe on the back  --
LUTHOR	Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.

EVE	You're not going to hit me?
LUTHOR	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
EVE	I knew you'd hit me.

LUTHOR	You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
EVE	I know...

LUTHOR	She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
EVE	A night on the town instead of under it?
LUTHOR	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.

EVE	I don't understand.
LUTHOR	Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
EVE	This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
LUTHOR	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
EVE	I didn't bring any  --

EVE	Oh. Why? does he live up here?
LUTHOR	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
EVE	What are you going to do to him?

LUTHOR	Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
EVE	Tea?
LUTHOR	You got wax in your ears?
EVE	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
LUTHOR	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.

EVE	Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
LUTHOR	Lex is going bye-bye.

EVE	Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
LUTHOR	Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
EVE	Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
LUTHOR	I'm wearing it.
EVE	I mean the other one!
LUTHOR	What other one?
EVE	You can't do this to me!
LUTHOR	Of course I can. I love you.

JOR-EL	But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
FIRST ELDER	Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
FIRST ELDER	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
JOR-EL	Then -
FIRST ELDER	But so is Vond-El

JOR-EL	I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
FIRST ELDER	This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
JOR-EL	And if I don't obey?

JOR-EL	As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
FIRST ELDER	If you persist, you leave us no choice.

FIRST ELDER	Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
JOR-EL	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.

JIMMY	What're you writing, Lois?
LOIS	an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
JIMMY	Two.
LOIS	'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 

JIMMY	Boy!
LOIS	Gets you where you live, huh?
JIMMY	How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
LOIS	It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.

LOIS	Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
JIMMY	On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.

MARTHA	It's a ...baby.
JONATHAN	What's your name, boy?
MARTHA	Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?

JONATHAN	Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
MARTHA	All of us.

MARTHA	The good lord works in mysterious ways.
JONATHAN	He sure as heck does that.
MARTHA	All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
JONATHAN	Folks'll ask question.
MARTHA	We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
JONATHAN	Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
MARTHA	I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
JONATHAN	Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
MARTHA	We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.

JONATHAN	Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
MARTHA	Don't brag now,  Jonathan.

MARTHA	Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
JONATHAN	What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
MARTHA	I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.

JOR-EL	It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
LARA	-- as we will be.
JOR-EL	Lara, please...
LARA	But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
JOR-EL	They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
LARA	A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
JOR-EL	Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
LARA	He'll be weightless.
JOR-EL	Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
LARA	He will be odd, different.

JOR-EL	You've been doing some research in the archives.
LARA	I want to know what my child is going to face.
JOR-EL	Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'

SUPERMAN	I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
JOR-EL	Enjoyed it?
SUPERMAN	I guess I got carried away
JOR-EL	My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
SUPERMAN	No! You couldn't imagine -
JOR-EL	How good it felt!
SUPERMAN	How good it felt -

JOR-EL	....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
SUPERMAN	Twenty-four.
JOR-EL	Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
SUPERMAN	There are none of them any good anyway.
JOR-EL	And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...

LOIS	Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
PERRY	It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.

PERRY	Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
LOIS	Okay, but...why?  No offense.

PERRY	Lois, the kickback story...
LOIS	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
PERRY	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.

PERRY	If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
LOIS	He is. Usually.
PERRY	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.

SUPERMAN	Easy now, miss, I've got you???
LOIS	You've got me? Who's got you???
SUPERMAN	Do as I say. Let go!
LOIS	Oh, God! I'm going to die!
SUPERMAN	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...

LOIS	Who...who...
SUPERMAN	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.

LOIS	With my luck, now it'll rain.
SUPERMAN	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.

LOIS	Superman???
SUPERMAN	Right on the first guess.
LOIS	Wha'...what are you doing here?
SUPERMAN	I came to talk to you.
LOIS	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
SUPERMAN	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
LOIS	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
SUPERMAN	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?

LOIS	Well...flashlight?
SUPERMAN	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
LOIS	If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
SUPERMAN	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
LOIS	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.

LOIS	Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
SUPERMAN	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
LOIS	Oh.  Well, where do we start?
SUPERMAN	Ask, You're the girl reporter.
LOIS	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
SUPERMAN	You think they're strange?
LOIS	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
SUPERMAN	I guess they are a little odd.
LOIS	Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
SUPERMAN	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
LOIS	Oh.
SUPERMAN	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
LOIS	It must feel great.
SUPERMAN	It's not bad.
LOIS	How old are you?
SUPERMAN	Thirty-five.
LOIS	How much do you weigh?
SUPERMAN	195 pounds.
LOIS	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
SUPERMAN	What about it?
LOIS	Can you really see through anything?
SUPERMAN	Uh-huh.
LOIS	Is it true you're impervious to pain?
SUPERMAN	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
LOIS	Do bullets really bounce off you?
SUPERMAN	Only when somebody shoots them at me.

LOIS	What color underwear am I wearing?
SUPERMAN	Pink.

LOIS	Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
SUPERMAN	Sure.
LOIS	Do you like pink?
SUPERMAN	Very much.
LOIS	Where do you hail from?
SUPERMAN	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...

OTIS	I...uh...
LUTHOR	No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?

LUTHOR	Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
OTIS	Yessir. Just what you wanted.

OTIS	There.
LUTHOR	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
OTIS	Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
LUTHOR	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?

LUTHOR	What's the matter, Otis?
OTIS	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
LUTHOR	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?

LUTHOR	I broke the man out of prison --
OTIS	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
LUTHOR	I gave him steady employment --
OTIS	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
LUTHOR	I gave him this new face.
OTIS	I...uh...check.

LUTHOR	And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
OTIS	I guess I...uh...regressed.

OTIS	Please...
LUTHOR	Otis...

LUTHOR	Is that real enough for you?
OTIS	It is for me.
LUTHOR	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!

LUTHOR	But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
OTIS	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
LUTHOR	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --

LUTHOR	Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
OTIS	It's a Twinkie, boss.

LUTHOR	They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
OTIS	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
LUTHOR	Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
OTIS	Oh, Mr. Luthor...

OTIS	I still don't get it.
LUTHOR	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.

OTIS	Sort of.
LUTHOR	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...

SUPERMAN	What is this??!
LUTHOR	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
SUPERMAN	But...why?

LUTHOR	Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
SUPERMAN	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
LUTHOR	Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --

LUTHOR	This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
SUPERMAN	I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
LUTHOR	No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.

LUTHOR	It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
SUPERMAN	Of time, Luthor.
LUTHOR	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --

LUTHOR	At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
SUPERMAN	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
LUTHOR	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...

SUPERMAN	Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
LUTHOR	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...

SUPERMAN	It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
LUTHOR	Maybe I should get help.
SUPERMAN	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
LUTHOR	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
SUPERMAN	The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
LUTHOR	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.

LUTHOR	Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
SUPERMAN	On radio waves?
LUTHOR	And garbage doors.

SUPERMAN	Luthor  --
LUTHOR	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!

LUTHOR	Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
SUPERMAN	They'll soon be over.
LUTHOR	In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...

SUPERMAN	Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
LUTHOR	For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.

LUTHOR	Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
SUPERMAN	We'll see how fast I can fly.

EPPS	You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
DRIVER	Y-yes.

EPPS	Where were you going?
DRIVER	Baghdad.
EPPS	What's in the other direction?
DRIVER	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
EPPS	Turn the car around.
DRIVER	Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
EPPS	Nobody's going to hurt you.

WES	Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
EPPS	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

WES	...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
EPPS	You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.

EPPS	Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
WES	I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.

WES	Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
EPPS	Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.

WES	Paper.
EPPS	It's a fortune box.

WES	What's it say?
EPPS	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.

WES	It's a map, I think that's what it is.
EPPS	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.

EPPS	A casual one.
WES	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
EPPS	Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.

WES	You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
EPPS	I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.

EPPS	Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
WES	Oh, God.

WES	What?
EPPS	I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
WES	I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.

EPPS	Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
WES	No, please, not again.

WES	What are we going to do!?
EPPS	We're going to keep driving.

WES	They stopped.
EPPS	Wha...
WES	Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.

EPPS	They shouldn't have been here.
WES	We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
EPPS	This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
WES	Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
EPPS	They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.

WES	What are you doing.
EPPS	Low on gas.  Got to refill.

EPPS	You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
WES	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.

EPPS	Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
WES	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
EPPS	He's not so--
WES	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
EPPS	How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.

WES	What kind of mine?
EPPS	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
WES	Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
EPPS	Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.

EPPS	We've got rope?
WES	For climbing.
EPPS	Break it out.

WES	What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
EPPS	You just go when I say go.
WES	Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.

EPPS	Ready?
WES	Yeah.

EPPS	All right.  Let's get out of here.
WES	The soldiers are going to kill those people!

EPPS	There's nothing we can do.
WES	We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.

EPPS	I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
WES	We can't just go off and--
EPPS	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.

EPPS	All we've got to do is make it to the top.
WES	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
EPPS	We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.

EPPS	Not much of a pass.
WES	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
EPPS	Picks up again just on the other side.

WES	The US Army:  Always an adventure.
EPPS	Let me see the map.

EPPS	Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
WES	What do you figure it to be?
EPPS	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.

WES	Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
EPPS	Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--

WES	Where'd they go?
EPPS	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
WES	Weird they didn't chase us.

WES	And they can't fly around out there forever.
EPPS	So we wait.

WES	Missile!
EPPS	Move!

EPPS	All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
WES	What am I supposed to do?
EPPS	Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.

WES	Epps!
EPPS	I heard!

EPPS	I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
WES	Ready when you are.

WES	You ready?
EPPS	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--

EPPS	It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
WES	What about the gold?
EPPS	What about it?
WES	Maybe we should split it up now.
EPPS	We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
WES	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.

WES	You're the one with all the ideas.
EPPS	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
WES	Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
EPPS	Maybe I do.
WES	Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.

WES	You got no reason to do that!
EPPS	I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?

WES	You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
EPPS	Then get up and do something about it.

EPPS	Get off him.
WES	He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
EPPS	Get off him!

EPPS	What happened?
WES	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

EPPS	Stop it!
WES	I told you; don't push me around.

WES	Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
EPPS	Why'd he come in our camp.

WES	Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
EPPS	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
WES	He...he could have been watching us.

WES	I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
EPPS	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.

WES	We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
EPPS	You said he was a deserter.
WES	That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
EPPS	You don't know that.
WES	You don't know he isn't.

EPPS	You're out of your mind.
WES	He's an enemy soldier.
EPPS	I'm not going to let you kill him.
WES	We're at war.

EPPS	We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
WES	He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.

WES	I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
EPPS	I've got no stomach for murder.
WES	It's a combat action.
EPPS	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
WES	Then step aside.
EPPS	No.
WES	Get out of my way.

WES	You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
EPPS	I out rank you, that's why.
WES	In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.

EPPS	We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
WES	What if I do?

WES	No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
EPPS	Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
WES	Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
EPPS	And let me guess who is.

WES	I'm the one's got the big stick.
EPPS	Suppose I don't go for that?
WES	Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
EPPS	What about Jaeger?
WES	Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.

WES	In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
EPPS	We thought--

EPPS	Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
WES	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
EPPS	Wes--
WES	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?

WES	Thanks for taking care of this for me.
EPPS	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.

WES	You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
EPPS	That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
WES	That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--

WES	They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
EPPS	You don't know John Epps very well, do you?

EPPS	Just keep quiet.
WES	I have to answer him.
EPPS	So you can give us away?
WES	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.

WES	Give it to me!
EPPS	If I give it to you, will you let us go?

WES	Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
EPPS	It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS	What are you doing?
JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS	Knock it off!
JAEGER	Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
EPPS	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
JAEGER	I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
EPPS	No you're not.

EPPS	You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
JAEGER	Blow me.
EPPS	Another month in this desert and I might just.

EPPS	Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
JAEGER	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.

EPPS	Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
JAEGER	There might be something in there.
EPPS	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
JAEGER	There might be.

JAEGER	This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
EPPS	Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
JAEGER	I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.

EPPS	You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
JAEGER	OH MY GOD!

EPPS	What!?  What!?
JAEGER	I did it!  I got the box open.

JAEGER	You think?
EPPS	Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.

JAEGER	They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
EPPS	Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
JAEGER	I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.

EPPS	Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
JAEGER	Wait.  Wait.

EPPS	I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
JAEGER	Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
EPPS	Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
JAEGER	Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.

EPPS	And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
JAEGER	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.

EPPS	It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
JAEGER	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
EPPS	But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.

EPPS	It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
JAEGER	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.

EPPS	Now this is war.
JAEGER	Roger that.

JAEGER	You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
EPPS	Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?

EPPS	But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?

EPPS	Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
JAEGER	Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
EPPS	A car?  You're going to buy a car?

EPPS	You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
JAEGER	What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
EPPS	Invest it.
JAEGER	Oh, that's fun.
EPPS	It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
JAEGER	And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
EPPS	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--

EPPS	Take the binoculars.
JAEGER	Wh-what do you think--
EPPS	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

EPPS	Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
JAEGER	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
EPPS	We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.

JAEGER	They'll shoot us!
EPPS	We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
JAEGER	They're not going to--
EPPS	It's the only way.  We drive!

EPPS	Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
JAEGER	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.

JAEGER	Steady it out!
EPPS	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!

EPPS	She okay?
JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
EPPS	Let's go.

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
EPPS	You can't tell anybody about this.
JAEGER	I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!

EPPS	It'd make their heads explode.
JAEGER	Millionaires, man.

EPPS	Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
JAEGER	...I know.
EPPS	And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
JAEGER	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

EPPS	What do we do with the Humvee?
JAEGER	We leave it.

EPPS	SAY IT!
JAEGER	I got that...sir.

JAEGER	Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
EPPS	Faster we get there, faster we get back.
JAEGER	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.

JAEGER	I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
EPPS	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
JAEGER	I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.

EPPS	What!?
JAEGER	Mine.

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	Mine.  Land mine!

EPPS	You didn't step on any mine.
JAEGER	I heard it click.
EPPS	If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
JAEGER	I heard it.

JAEGER	Oh, God!  Oh God!
EPPS	Just be cool.
JAEGER	It's a mine, isn't it?
EPPS	Just relax.
JAEGER	How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
EPPS	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.

JAEGER	Where you going?
EPPS	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
JAEGER	Why you got to move away to talk!?
EPPS	We're going to be right over here.
JAEGER	You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
EPPS	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

EPPS	There's a way.
JAEGER	Epps...

EPPS	I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
JAEGER	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.

JAEGER	My leg is falling asleep.
EPPS	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
JAEGER	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
EPPS	It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.

JAEGER	How's this going to work?
EPPS	Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
JAEGER	That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.

EPPS	You're going to be fine.
JAEGER	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

EPPS	When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
JAEGER	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.

JAEGER	You're going to blow yourselves up.
EPPS	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
JAEGER	You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
EPPS	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.

EPPS	This.  Whatever it is.
JAEGER	It's the treasure, that's what it is.

EPPS	You're not losing trust, are you?
JAEGER	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.

EPPS	I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
JAEGER	Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.

JAEGER	I don't hear any--
EPPS	Shut up and listen!

EPPS	Don't!
JAEGER	It's a fire fight.
EPPS	Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.

EPPS	Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
JAEGER	What are they doing here?

EPPS	Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
JAEGER	What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?

EPPS	They're doing more than slapping.
JAEGER	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.

EPPS	Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
JAEGER	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.

JAEGER	X marks the spot.
EPPS	Something like that.
JAEGER	But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
EPPS	I hope it means something, otherwise...

JAEGER	Where is it?  Where'd it go?
EPPS	Stay low.
JAEGER	Where the hell is it!?
EPPS	Just stay down.

JAEGER	What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
EPPS	We're not going to do anything.
JAEGER	They're going to kill us!
EPPS	They can't shoot us in here.

JAEGER	If they land--
EPPS	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.

JAEGER	Think there might be more Iraqis?
EPPS	Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.

EPPS	A whole lot of nothing.
JAEGER	So where do we start?

EPPS	What are you doing?
JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?
EPPS	It looks like you're not doing anything.
JAEGER	I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
EPPS	Get up and dig.
JAEGER	We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
EPPS	Get up off your ass and dig!

JAEGER	Must be a compartment.
EPPS	I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.

JAEGER	Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
EPPS	It's giving.

EPPS	It's just a mongoose.
JAEGER	Is it dead?
EPPS	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

JAEGER	It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
EPPS	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
JAEGER	You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.

JAEGER	Wait.
EPPS	What?

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
EPPS	He's not going to leave us.
JAEGER	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...

JAEGER	Why do I have to stay down here?
EPPS	Jesus, Jaeger.
JAEGER	I don't see how that plan's any better.
EPPS	Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.

EPPS	All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.

EPPS	What the hell took so long.
JAEGER	Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
EPPS	Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.

JAEGER	Wes might be right about that.
EPPS	It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.

EPPS	We should head Northeast.
JAEGER	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
EPPS	There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
JAEGER	It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
EPPS	You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.

JAEGER	What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
EPPS	We'll find our way.
JAEGER	How!?
EPPS	We'll find our way!  We'll...

EPPS	We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
JAEGER	Forget Wes.
EPPS	We can't just leave him.
JAEGER	Wes is dead!
EPPS	What if he's not?
JAEGER	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.

JAEGER	No.
EPPS	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.

JAEGER	No.
EPPS	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
JAEGER	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
EPPS	We'll lie.
JAEGER	They'll search the pack.

EPPS	First Wes, now you?
JAEGER	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
EPPS	And you; you've got it all together.
JAEGER	I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
EPPS	That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.

JAEGER	I'm sorry about that, Epps.
EPPS	Is it all right if I stand up?

JAEGER	I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
EPPS	Yeah.  Well, me too.
JAEGER	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
EPPS	Sure.
JAEGER	Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
EPPS	You still got a map on you?
JAEGER	What?  Yeah.

JAEGER	Epps?
EPPS	Yeah.
JAEGER	I don't want to die.
EPPS	Makes two of us.
JAEGER	I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
EPPS	It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
JAEGER	I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--

JAEGER	Sorry.
EPPS	Damn.

JAEGER	What do you think our chances are?
EPPS	If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.

JAEGER	Wonder how the war's going?
EPPS	It's got to be going better than this..

EPPS	We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
JAEGER	You sure you want me too?

JAEGER	I pick that way.
EPPS	Okay.  Then we go this way.

JAEGER	Getting cold.
EPPS	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
JAEGER	Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
EPPS	No!
JAEGER	Just let me rest for a second.
EPPS	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
JAEGER	You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
EPPS	Don't you touch it.
JAEGER	I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
EPPS	The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
JAEGER	Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.

JAEGER	What do you figure it is?
EPPS	Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
JAEGER	Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
EPPS	Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.

EPPS	We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
JAEGER	Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.

JAEGER	Well?
EPPS	Well, we should identify ourselves.
JAEGER	Yeah, I guess we should.

EPPS	Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
JAEGER	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.

EPPS	That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
JAEGER	Probably.

EPPS	What did you say?
JAEGER	I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
EPPS	They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!

JAEGER	Oh, God...
EPPS	They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
JAEGER	What are we going to do?

EPPS	Slip out your M-16.
JAEGER	And then what?
EPPS	And then shoot them.
JAEGER	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
EPPS	Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.

JAEGER	Can't you--
EPPS	I don't have a weapon.

EPPS	Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
JAEGER	I just said I would.  I don't think I--
EPPS	Shoot them!

EPPS	An Iraqi?
JAEGER	I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.

JAEGER	What do we do?
EPPS	We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.

JAEGER	To where?
EPPS	Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.

JAEGER	What do we do?
EPPS	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

JAEGER	What do you make of them?
EPPS	Shi'ites, I think.
JAEGER	Is that good, or bad?
EPPS	I don't know.  They killed Wes.
JAEGER	Why haven't they killed us!?
EPPS	I don't know!
JAEGER	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
EPPS	With what?  Against how many?
JAEGER	We can't just sit here waiting to die.
EPPS	You come up with a better plan, let me know.
JAEGER	Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.

EPPS	...Wes...?
JAEGER	You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!

JAEGER	I didn't say that.  I never said--
EPPS	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.

JAEGER	Can you ride a horse?
EPPS	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

JAEGER	Which way do we go!?
EPPS	We go this way.

EPPS	Damn it.  We lost the horses.
JAEGER	The...the gold...
EPPS	It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
JAEGER	When did you make the switch?
EPPS	It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
JAEGER	But...
EPPS	We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
JAEGER	What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
EPPS	You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.

JAEGER	Well?
EPPS	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
JAEGER	How do we do that?
EPPS	You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
JAEGER	Why do I have to lie in the road?
EPPS	Somebody has to.
JAEGER	Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
EPPS	Then I'm a rich man.

JAEGER	Epps.
EPPS	Yeah.
JAEGER	I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
EPPS	Thanks.
JAEGER	This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
EPPS	Threatened to blow my brains out?
JAEGER	Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
EPPS	Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.

JAEGER	Epps?
EPPS	What?
JAEGER	I'm thinking about taking a trip.
EPPS	Thought you were going to buy a car.
JAEGER	Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
EPPS	I don't know.
JAEGER	I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
EPPS	How the hell should I know?

EPPS	Australia.
JAEGER	What?
EPPS	I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
JAEGER	Really?
EPPS	That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.

JAEGER	Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
EPPS	We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.

JAEGER	Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
EPPS	He'll slow down.

JAEGER	He's not slowing.
EPPS	He's going to slow down.

JAEGER	Woods.
WOODS	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
JAEGER	I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
WOODS	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?

WOODS	That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
JAEGER	I could use some recon photos too.

WOODS	Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
JAEGER	Just...want to be ready when we do.
WOODS	Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
JAEGER	The photos.

JAEGER	Some good ones.
WOODS	They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
JAEGER	Saddam's got a boil on his ass?

WES	Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
JAEGER	A headache?
WES	Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
JAEGER	I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
WES	Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
JAEGER	Okay.

JAEGER	We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
WES	I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
JAEGER	People are suffering.
WES	People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.

JAEGER	When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
WES	I'm saying don't do it accidently.
JAEGER	Oh yeah.  Accidently.

WES	Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
JAEGER	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
WES	I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.

JAEGER	Spanish wasn't hard enough?
WES	I thought it would be good to know.

JAEGER	What does that mean?
WES	Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
JAEGER	How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
WES	Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.

JAEGER	What is this?
WES	Now you need me.
JAEGER	What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.

WES	He says it's a box.
JAEGER	Yeah, you're funny.
WES	It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
JAEGER	For real?  A treasure?

WES	And you're the guy who's going to open it.
JAEGER	I could.

WES	You get it yet?
JAEGER	Naw, nothing.
WES	You will.  You'll get it.
JAEGER	I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
WES	You really think there's a treasure inside?
JAEGER	I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

WES	Jaeger?
JAEGER	What?
WES	You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
JAEGER	Yeah.  So?
WES	That's in two days.
JAEGER	Like I said; so?
WES	They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
JAEGER	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
WES	We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
JAEGER	It doesn't mean anything.
WES	Why would they do all that if we weren't?

WES	Jaeger?
JAEGER	What!?
WES	You ever think about dying?
JAEGER	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
WES	You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
JAEGER	The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
WES	This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.

WES	The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
JAEGER	You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.

JAEGER	It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
WES	It's a container.  Break the seal.

JAEGER	That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
WES	Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

JAEGER	We...we could go home with something else.
WES	What?
JAEGER	With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.

WES	You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
JAEGER	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
WES	You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
JAEGER	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
WES	It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
JAEGER	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
WES	So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.

WES	Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
JAEGER	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
WES	You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.

WES	God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
JAEGER	Yes!

WES	We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
JAEGER	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.

JAEGER	Epps, is that a sand dune.
WES	Oh, no.

JAEGER	Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
WES	If!  If there's a treasure.
JAEGER	Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
WES	I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
JAEGER	Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
WES	How the hell should I know how much?

WES	If there's gold.  If!
JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my half?

WES	This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
JAEGER	A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--

JAEGER	Iraqis.
WES	Oh, God!
JAEGER	Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
WES	Oh, Jesus!
JAEGER	They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!

JAEGER	Yeah!  Yeah!
WES	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
JAEGER	You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.

WES	I thought we were dead.
JAEGER	Yeah, well, we're not.
WES	We got to get out of here.

WES	We have to go back.
JAEGER	We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
WES	We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?

WES	So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
JAEGER	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

JAEGER	We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
WES	Then lets go back while we still can.
JAEGER	As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.

WES	You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
JAEGER	You have to go with us, Wes.
WES	Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
JAEGER	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...

JAEGER	Epps...
WES	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.

WES	How long we going to keep this up.
JAEGER	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
WES	Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
JAEGER	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
WES	You want to crawl, crawl.

WES	If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
JAEGER	Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.

WES	I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
JAEGER	Anytime you want to do something about it just let--

JAEGER	Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
WES	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.

WES	Is there anything you do know?
JAEGER	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.

JAEGER	So?
WES	We have to do something.

WES	We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
JAEGER	Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
WES	You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
JAEGER	I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.

JAEGER	Think we can make it?
WES	We make it, or we go back empty handed.

JAEGER	Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
WES	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

WES	What do you think?
JAEGER	Lines up with the map and the photos.

WES	It's got a bottom.
JAEGER	Guess we know what the next stop is.

WES	You down?
JAEGER	Yeah, we're down.
WES	What do you see?

WES	What the hell are you doing!?
JAEGER	I think we found something.

JAEGER	With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
WES	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.

WES	Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
JAEGER	He lived through that?

JAEGER	Maybe we should give him some water.
WES	All last night he could have been--
JAEGER	I think he wants something to drink.
WES	I'm not wasting my water on him.

JAEGER	So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
WES	He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.

JAEGER	Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
WES	You want to say some words?

JAEGER	You're going to burn up in those.
WES	The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.

JAEGER	Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
WES	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.

WES	When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
JAEGER	We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
WES	You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.

M	... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
M	What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 

M	But -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
M	Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	It's too late -
M	GET BOND OUT OF THERE.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Admiral, are you suggesting -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
MINISTER JOHNSTONE	And I have the entire British economy to worry about.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
MINISTER JOHNSTONE	I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?

HARMSWAY	Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
BOND	You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.

BOND	It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
HARMSWAY	I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.

HARMSWAY	I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
BOND	Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
HARMSWAY	A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
BOND	We'll see about that.

BOND	How did you get this number?
HARMSWAY	Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
BOND	I'm on my way.

HARMSWAY	Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
BOND	Sir Elliot.
HARMSWAY	Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.

HARMSWAY	Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
BOND	I see.
HARMSWAY	I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
BOND	I wonder if it runs in the family.
HARMSWAY	The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.

HARMSWAY	Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
BOND	I can feel your pain.

HARMSWAY	By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
BOND	Sightseeing.

HARMSWAY	I call this the Rogue's gallery.
BOND	Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
HARMSWAY	My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
BOND	So why did you leave?
HARMSWAY	Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this

HARMSWAY	Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
BOND	And still not a thing to watch.

BOND	...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
HARMSWAY	They're merely tools to disseminate information.
BOND	Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
HARMSWAY	Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.

HARMSWAY	You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
BOND	...Words to live by?
HARMSWAY	Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.

BOND	Briefly.
HARMSWAY	Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

HARMSWAY	...And what's that, my dear?
BOND	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

BOND	I'm sure they will.
HARMSWAY	Good-bye, Mister Bond.

BOND	Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
HARMSWAY	My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.

BOND	...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
HARMSWAY	Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
BOND	- Instant melt-down.
HARMSWAY	Chernobyl will look like a campfire.

HARMSWAY	...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
BOND	What about the gold?

BOND	I'd rather die alone.
HARMSWAY	Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.

CAPTAIN CHEONG	In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
BOND	I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
CAPTAIN CHEONG	Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
BOND	I'm sorry.
CAPTAIN CHEONG	The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
BOND	Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
CAPTAIN CHEONG	Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
BOND	I appreciate your time -
CAPTAIN CHEONG	Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
BOND	Where can I find him?
CAPTAIN CHEONG	Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.

MONEYPENNY	I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
BOND	Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
MONEYPENNY	Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.

BOND	4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
MONEYPENNY	Four o'clock. Don't be late.
BOND	Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
MONEYPENNY	Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

BOND	Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
MONEYPENNY	Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
BOND	In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.

MONEYPENNY	By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
BOND	Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?

MONEYPENNY	Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
BOND	- We all want what we can't have?
MONEYPENNY	Not all of us, 007.

BOND	What - no lust for adventure?
MONEYPENNY	No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.

BOND	Q! How are you?
Q	Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
BOND	I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Q	That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
BOND	Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Q	Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
BOND	Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Q	I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -

Q	Your new car. 
BOND	- Four wheel drive?
Q	Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
BOND	... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Q	Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.

BOND	I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Q	Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.

BOND	Yes -
CAPTAIN MORTON	Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!

BOND	Wait a minute -
CAPTAIN MORTON	Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.

BOND	Don't you think you're overreacting?
CAPTAIN MORTON	Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
BOND	...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
CAPTAIN MORTON	What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
BOND	Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
CAPTAIN MORTON	That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
BOND	I know what I saw -

BOND	Paris?!? What are you doing here?
PARIS	Is that any way to say hello?
BOND	I thought your specialty was good-bye.

PARIS	Oh, James. I've missed you -
BOND	Is this another one of your games?
PARIS	Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
BOND	I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.

PARIS	Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
BOND	Nothing.

BOND	What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
PARIS	No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -

PARIS	Do you feel better now?
BOND	Do you?

BOND	What about the uranium?
PARIS	It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.

PARIS	I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
BOND	Shhhhh...
PARIS	Just hold me.

BOND	Paris -
PARIS	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
BOND	Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
PARIS	He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!

PARIS	Just - say it. Say it just once.
BOND	One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	His newspapers?
BOND	Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
BOND	Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?

MINISTER JOHNSTONE	There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
BOND	Political considerations?
MINISTER JOHNSTONE	To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.

BOND	Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
SAUNDERS	Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
BOND	Come on. I know better than that -

BOND	It must do something.
SAUNDERS	Well... If you insist.

SAUNDERS	Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
BOND	How is old Q?
SAUNDERS	Gone fishing.
BOND	Fishing?
SAUNDERS	Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.

BOND	Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
SAUNDERS	Not from forty feet.

BOND	... Shoelaces?
SAUNDERS	Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
BOND	Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
SAUNDERS	Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
BOND	Does it work on cash machines?

SAUNDERS	It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
BOND	I see...
SAUNDERS	Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
BOND	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
SAUNDERS	Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.

BOND	A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
SAUNDERS	I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."

BOND	Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
WADE	I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
BOND	That's reassuring.
WADE	Hey - the world is my office.
BOND	Let's take a look at the body.

WADE	I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
BOND	Something with an engine? Not oars?
WADE	Step into my office.

WADE	What do you want with the Harbor Master?
BOND	Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
WADE	Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.

WADE	I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
BOND	Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

BOND	Natalya?
WADE	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
BOND	She married a hockey player.
WADE	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
BOND	We work in the dark. We do what we can.

BOND	I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
WADE	Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
BOND	Can you arrange a meeting?
WADE	Hell. The CIA built that club.

WADE	Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
BOND	He tied one on.

WADE	I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
BOND	Who knows? Fog, night...
WADE	They'd never sail this close to the shore.
BOND	Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!

WADE	I got you covered.
BOND	That's reassuring.

BOND	Sidney Winch, meet -
WADE	Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -

WADE	Where to now, Jimbo?
BOND	I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

BOND	Interesting presentation.
DOMINIQUE	Interesting video tape.
BOND	They point, I shoot.
DOMINIQUE	Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
BOND	Of course.

DOMINIQUE	... Does this do anything?
BOND	Depends what number you write.

BOND	Married?
DOMINIQUE	Happily.
BOND	... Kids?
DOMINIQUE	Three. You? Married?
BOND	No.
DOMINIQUE	I didn't think so.

DOMINIQUE	Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
BOND	Thanks.  Take care -
DOMINIQUE	You too.

SIDNEY	Bourbon. Neat.
BOND	I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.

SIDNEY	Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
BOND	- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
SIDNEY	Have we met?
BOND	This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
SIDNEY	Sidney Winch.

BOND	Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
SIDNEY	No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.

BOND	Boyfriend?
SIDNEY	Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
BOND	Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
SIDNEY	So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?

BOND	Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
SIDNEY	And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
BOND	Insurance. Lloyds of London.
SIDNEY	The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
BOND	I'll keep that in mind.
SIDNEY	I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
BOND	Nice to run into you again.
SIDNEY	Let's not make it a habit.

SIDNEY	- Shut up!
BOND	You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
SIDNEY	No?
BOND	No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
SIDNEY	So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.

SIDNEY	Do I have to do everything around here?
BOND	I hope so.

BOND	I hope you'll be gentle.
SIDNEY	Think about mom.

SIDNEY	And what do you call this?
BOND	- The family jewels?

BOND	If I were you -
SIDNEY	- You're not.
BOND	Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
SIDNEY	Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."

BOND	Why don't we just take these -
SIDNEY	No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.

BOND	... Do you have a gun?
SIDNEY	What?
BOND	You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
SIDNEY	That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
BOND	Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.

BOND	Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
SIDNEY	Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
BOND	Blood or Dutch?
SIDNEY	He was my father's best friend!
BOND	He's killed closer.
SIDNEY	You are seriously deranged.
BOND	Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?

SIDNEY	This has got to be a mistake.
BOND	The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.

BOND	Wait here.
SIDNEY	No. I'm going with you.

BOND	... How did you get into marine salvage?
SIDNEY	My father left me the business.

BOND	Not a lot of difference.
SIDNEY	What do you mean?

SIDNEY	What the hell does that do?
BOND	Cleans dirt. Let's go.

SIDNEY	Down?
BOND	Up.

SIDNEY	What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
BOND	Trust me.

BOND	Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
SIDNEY	Are you listening to me?
BOND	Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
SIDNEY	... We have time for that?

BOND	Sometimes you just have to -
SIDNEY	Don't say it.

SIDNEY	Is this - like - a normal day for you?
BOND	It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.

BOND	Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
SIDNEY	...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
BOND	Another reason??? Did I miss something???
SIDNEY	You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.

BOND	If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
SIDNEY	If not?
BOND	We blast through.

BOND	Sleep well?
SIDNEY	Next time, I do the driving.

SIDNEY	What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
BOND	I didn't say when I want to die -

BOND	... Yes???
SIDNEY	Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
BOND	... Yes?
SIDNEY	First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
BOND	And number two?
SIDNEY	If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
BOND	And when might that be?
SIDNEY	Now.

M	Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
BOND	Yes, M.

M	Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
BOND	Of course.  Minister Johnstone.

M	Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
BOND	Only what I read in the newspapers.

M	- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
BOND	'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.

BOND	... What's Harmsway done?
M	It seems, 007, we've received a tip

M	The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
BOND	Of course.
M	Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
BOND	... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
M	Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -

M	You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
BOND	I understand.

BOND	.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
M	We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.

M	But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
BOND	Hopefully, it won't get that far.

BOND	...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
M	Good luck on your mission, 007.

BOND	Sorry I'm late -
M	Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?

M	...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
BOND	I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
M	What do you make of all this?
BOND	It doesn't quite add up.

BOND	The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
M	Sabotage?
BOND	A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.

BOND	... And what do you call these?
JENNY WU	Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
BOND	Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.

BOND	And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
JENNY WU	Stop it!
BOND	I was just getting to the interesting part!
JENNY WU	We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
BOND	Remind me.

JENNY WU	Sakwa!
BOND	Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
JENNY WU	Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.

JENNY WU	Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
BOND	Tsi tien, Professor Wu.

CAPTAIN MORTON	Who's in charge here?
SIDNEY	I am. What do you want?
CAPTAIN MORTON	You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
SIDNEY	Forget it. No way. I got here first.
CAPTAIN MORTON	Who's Wade?

SIDNEY	What's your name?
CAPTAIN MORTON	Captain Morton.

SIDNEY	My name is Sidney Winch, and -
CAPTAIN MORTON	Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
SIDNEY	I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
CAPTAIN MORTON	Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
SIDNEY	I was an attorney!
CAPTAIN MORTON	Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
SIDNEY	No.
CAPTAIN MORTON	You leave me no alternative.

SIDNEY	You won't get away with this!
CAPTAIN MORTON	Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
HARMSWAY	Pencil it in for the next trip -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
HARMSWAY	Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
HARMSWAY	No -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The Queen invited you to dinner -
HARMSWAY	Yes -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
HARMSWAY	Excellent.

HELMSMAN	Damn. It's doing it again.
FIRST OFFICER	What's wrong?
HELMSMAN	About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.

HELMSMAN	The back-up does the same thing.
FIRST OFFICER	Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?

FIRST OFFICER	How is it now?
HELMSMAN	Seems to be back to normal, sir.

FIRST OFFICER	A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
HELMSMAN	Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
FIRST OFFICER	Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.

SIDNEY	What is HE doing here?
HARMSWAY	I see you two have met.

HARMSWAY	Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
SIDNEY	- I told you! He was there! -
HARMSWAY	- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?

SIDNEY	He brought that up from the wreck.
HARMSWAY	...I see.

HARMSWAY	...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
SIDNEY	Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
HARMSWAY	No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.

HARMSWAY	How sweet.
SIDNEY	My timing always was lousy.

YUNG	That was too close.
HARMSWAY	Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.

YUNG	The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
HARMSWAY	Excellent.

HARMSWAY	Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
YUNG	Approaching the first gate.
HARMSWAY	Start the grinders.

HARMSWAY	Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
YUNG	Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -

HARMSWAY	Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
YUNG	You have to leave -
HARMSWAY	A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.

YUNG	Take the men. I can finish alone.
HARMSWAY	You come with me -  You stay here.

HARMSWAY	Is the helicopter ready?
STAMPER	Fueled and waiting.
HARMSWAY	Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.

STAMPER	It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
HARMSWAY	Get more men up there!

STAMPER	They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
HARMSWAY	I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!

HARMSWAY	- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
STAMPER	Yes. Shall we kill them?
HARMSWAY	No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.

HARMSWAY	What the hell is going on?
STAMPER	It's Bond!
HARMSWAY	Kill him! Finish it!

NUMBER THREE	I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
HARMSWAY	...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
NUMBER THREE	Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.

HARMSWAY	... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
NUMBER THREE	No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
HARMSWAY	You disappoint me, Number Three.

NUMBER THREE	Please sir. Please -
HARMSWAY	...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.

HARMSWAY	Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
NUMBER THREE	Thank you sir! Thank you!

M	What about ID's?
TANNER	One to seven: Deal the face cards.

TANNER	Oh, no.
M	Who is it?
TANNER	Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
M	Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?

M	Who is that?!? What's in the box??
TANNER	I don't know. He's not in the database -
M	What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???

M	Will it go off?
TANNER	Maybe. Maybe not.
M	Abort the cruise.

TANNER	Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
M	Will the cruise set it off?
TANNER	Yes.

ALAN	You did break in.
FLYNN	Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
ALAN	Are you embezzling?
FLYNN	Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
ALAN	I don't get it.
FLYNN	You haven't told him?

FLYNN	Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
ALAN	You invented Space Paranoids?
FLYNN	Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
ALAN	Senior exec.
FLYNN	Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
ALAN	I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
FLYNN	Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.

ALAN	Dillinger?
FLYNN	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..

ALAN	Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
FLYNN	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...

FLYNN	Hi, Alan.
ALAN	Hi, Flynn.

FLYNN	My dinner.
ALAN	I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
FLYNN	Want one?
ALAN	Uh... got any cinnamon?

ALAN	Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
FLYNN	I know, I met him.

ALAN	Your old files -- ?
FLYNN	And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
ALAN	Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...

ALAN	Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
FLYNN	Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...

LORA	How's it going upstairs?
ALAN	Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.

LORA	Did you say Group 7 access?
ALAN	Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
LORA	Did he say why?
ALAN	Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
LORA	Flynn had Group 7 access.
ALAN	Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
LORA	Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
ALAN	Okay, okay...
LORA	I want to go to his place.
ALAN	You call that getting over it?
LORA	I mean I want both of us to go.

ALAN	What for?
LORA	To warn him.
ALAN	Of what?
LORA	That Dillinger's on to him.

ALAN	For what?
LORA	For being on to Dillinger.
ALAN	What -- ?

LORA	Flynn!
ALAN	Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -

LORA	I don't think I'm cleared for this.
ALAN	I'm certainly not.

ALAN	Beautiful!
GIBBS	Hello, Alan.
ALAN	Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.

GIBBS	Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
ALAN	Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
GIBBS	Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!

ALAN	Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
GIBBS	Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
ALAN	They'll start to soon enough.
GIBBS	Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.

DILLINGER	Come on in...
ALAN	Alan. Alan Bailey.
DILLINGER	Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?

ALAN	Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
DILLINGER	oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
ALAN	Yeah...?
DILLINGER	We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
ALAN	I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
DILLINGER	No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
ALAN	It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
DILLINGER	Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
ALAN	No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
DILLINGER	Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
ALAN	Ok

FLYNN	What do you mean, "'yes"?
BIT	Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.

FLYNN	That all you can say?
BIT	No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
FLYNN	Oh. Anything else?
BIT	Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
FLYNN	only yes and no...  You're a bit.
BIT	For sure...
FLYNN	where's your program? Won't it miss you?
BIT	No...

FLYNN	I'm your program?
BIT	Right on the money!
FLYNN	Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?

FLYNN	Way to go! We're haulin'!
BIT	Yes, okay, exactement!

FLYNN	This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
BIT	No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!

FLYNN	This town's full o' live ones.
BIT	Not a chance.

BIT	You said it.
FLYNN	So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?

BIT	Yes!
FLYNN	Let's get outta here.

DILLINGER	No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
MCP	It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
DILLINGER	Flynn?
MCP	Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
DILLINGER	He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
MCP	I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
DILLINGER	Meanwhile, he might find it.
MCP	I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
DILLINGER	I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
MCP	There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
DILLINGER	Cute.
MCP	End of line.

MCP	Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
DILLINGER	I'm sorry -
MCP	I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
DILLINGER	It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
MCP	And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
DILLINGER	The Pentagon?
MCP	It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
DILLINGER	Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
MCP	I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
DILLINGER	What do you want with the Pentagon?
MCP	The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
DILLINGER	If you think -
MCP	You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
DILLINGER	You wouldn't dare.
MCP	So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.

GIBBS	Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
DILLINGER	Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
GIBBS	That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
DILLINGER	The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
GIBBS	User requests are what computers are for.
DILLINGER	Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --

GIBBS	Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
DILLINGER	It can be arranged...

GIBBS	That was uncalled-for.
DILLINGER	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
GIBBS	Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.

DUMONT	Yes?
TRON	I... have come to communicate with my User.
DUMONT	Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...

TRON	Well I want to communicate --
DUMONT	Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you

TRON	Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
DUMONT	Hah.
TRON	Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
DUMONT	When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...

DUMONT	Who is your User, program?
TRON	Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
DUMONT	All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.

TRON	Dumont!
DUMONT	No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
TRON	Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
DUMONT	They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...

FLYNN	Alan!
TRON	Where did you hear that name?
FLYNN	Well, isn't it -- ?
TRON	The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
FLYNN	I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?

TRON	What, just the three of us?
FLYNN	You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?

FLYNN	What's that?
TRON	Tanks...coming back. Let's go.

FLYNN	How about over there...that empty memory?
TRON	No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.

TRON	Flynn!!
FLYNN	Greetings, program...
TRON	You're alive!
FLYNN	Yeah, I... oops!

TRON	Flynn...  Where's Ram?
FLYNN	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.

FLYNN	No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
TRON	Wrote the...?
FLYNN	It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.

TRON	But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
FLYNN	You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
TRON	Then...
FLYNN	Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
TRON	Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
FLYNN	I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
TRON	Stranger and stranger...

TRON	We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
FLYNN	All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.

FLYNN	What about our friend - Sark?
TRON	Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
FLYNN	Not us, I hope.
TRON	Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.

FLYNN	Did we make it?
TRON	Yes.

FLYNN	Hey... you guys OK?
TRON	How about you?
FLYNN	Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...

YORI	A User -- in our world?
FLYNN	Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

FLYNN	Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
YORI	A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
FLYNN	What's wrong with that area?

YORI	The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
FLYNN	Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.

FLYNN	There's another beam!
YORI	It's too far!

YORI	How did you do that, Flynn?
FLYNN	Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
YORI	Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...

YORI	Flynn, we've got to help him!
FLYNN	Let's get some power here.

FLYNN	Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
YORI	Why? What are you going to do?
FLYNN	Jump.

YORI	But... won't you be de-rezzed?
FLYNN	Probably.

YORI	Flynn... you can't... I
FLYNN	Shhhhh.

RAM	You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
FLYNN	Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
RAM	You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
FLYNN	Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.

FLYNN	Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
RAM	Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
FLYNN	Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
RAM	How 'bout yourself?
FLYNN	Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
RAM	Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...

RAM	Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
FLYNN	Tron...?

RAM	He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
FLYNN	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP

FLYNN	Watch it!
RAM	Recognizers!

FLYNN	It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
RAM	The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
FLYNN	Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
RAM	PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
FLYNN	It grows on you.

FLYNN	Feel what? You okay?
RAM	Alan-One...

FLYNN	What's goin' on?
RAM	We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
FLYNN	Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -

FLYNN	Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
RAM	Come here.

FLYNN	Hey... !
RAM	Little more juice's all it needs...

FLYNN	Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
LORA	We have to talk.
FLYNN	Good luck. You can't even think in here.

FLYNN	So...how's the world of serious science?
LORA	Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
FLYNN	Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?

LORA	You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
FLYNN	Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...

LORA	I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
FLYNN	Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

LORA	Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
FLYNN	Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...

LORA	Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
FLYNN	Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
LORA	As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...

FLYNN	you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
LORA	Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
FLYNN	Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...

FLYNN	Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
LORA	You're getting out of the business?

SARK	Thank. you, Master Control.
MCP	We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
SARK	Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
MCP	Strategic Air Command.

SARK	Yes, MCP.
MCP	I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
SARK	You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
MCP	He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.

SARK	A User?
MCP	That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.

SARK	Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
MCP	Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
SARK	But-what if I can't...?
MCP	You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?

SARK	Wait...I need that...
MCP	Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.

SARK	Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
MCP	End of line.

MCP	I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
SARK	Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
MCP	Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
SARK	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
MCP	I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.

RAM	New guy...
TRON	Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
RAM	The Users...you really think they're still there?
TRON	They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.

RAM	What do you think?
TRON	Do it!

RAM	You think we can make it there?
TRON	We have to.

RAM	Do you know what he's talking about?
TRON	I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

TRON	Yori... hey...
YORI	Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...

YORI	I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
TRON	That's all going to change, Yori...
YORI	How?
TRON	Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to

YORI	My quarters.
TRON	Why is everything...like this?
YORI	It's a flat. But wait a micro...

YORI	You've grown, big program.
TRON	I had to...in the games...

YORI	Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
TRON	As long as it gets us out of here

TRON	This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
YORI	Then I owe you some thanks...

TRON	What is it?
YORI	Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
TRON	We have to get off this beam!
YORI	I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!

TRON	Nice...
YORI	It's something Users do.
TRON	Where's Flynn?

HELEN	I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
HELEN	Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
ALLISON	I'm shocked.
HELEN	Yeah.  You know Harry.

HELEN	You bitch.

ALLISON	Helen!  It's your mystery man.
HELEN	Simon?  Ohmygod.

HELEN	Can you cover me for an hour?
ALLISON	Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
HELEN	Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.

HELEN	Where are you going?
DANA	Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
HELEN	No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
DANA	Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.

HELEN	That's not true, honey--
DANA	It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.

HELEN	Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
DANA	Where are you going?
HELEN	Out.

DANA	I'm done.
HELEN	Where are you off to young lady?
DANA	I have a book report.

HARRY	Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
DANA	He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
HARRY	You seem fine now.
DANA	Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
HARRY	I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.

HARRY	Dana, are you listening to me?
DANA	Yeah, Dad.
HARRY	You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
DANA	Okay, Dad.
HARRY	You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
DANA	I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...

HARRY	How was school today?
DANA	Fine.

HARRY	There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
DANA	Yeah, right.
HARRY	You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
DANA	Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?

DANA	Dad, how come you know the words?
HARRY	Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
DANA	Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.

HARRY	I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
DANA	Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?

HARRY	Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
FAISIL	Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
HARRY	You're kidding.

HARRY	Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.

FAISIL	Roger, One.  Rolling.

TRILBY	Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
FAISIL	Yes.
TRILBY	So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
FAISIL	Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.

TRILBY	Why?
TRILBY	This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.

HARRY	Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
GIB	It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.

GIB	Harry!  Where are you!
HARRY	In the helicopter.

GIB	Harry?  HARRY?!
HARRY	What?

HARRY	What's this for?
GIB	For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
HARRY	Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.

HARRY	What a team.  See you at eight.
GIB	Yep.  Sleep fast.

HARRY	Thanks dear.
GIB	Here, check these out.

HARRY	Son of a bitch!
GIB	What?

GIB	Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
HARRY	She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
GIB	Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.

HARRY	Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
GIB	Fourteen, Harry.
HARRY	Right.  She's only fourteen.

HARRY	No way.  Not Dana.

GIB	Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.

GIB	Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
HARRY	I thought you moved out.
GIB	Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.

HARRY	Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
GIB	Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.

HARRY	You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
GIB	In her dreams.

HARRY	It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
GIB	Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.

GIB	It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
HARRY	Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--

HARRY	She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
GIB	She could be moving money, guns. Anything.

HARRY	What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
GIB	Yeah, right.

HARRY	Station wagon?
GIB	Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

GIB	Helen's going to be pissed.
HARRY	See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.

GIB	What's the plan?

GIB	There's another guy, still in the car.
HARRY	Stay on him.

GIB	Copy that.
HARRY	And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.

GIB	Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
HARRY	Okay.  Here she comes.

HARRY	Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
GIB	Goddammit!  That's outrageous.

HARRY	So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
GIB	That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.

GIB	Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
HARRY	Son of a bitch!
GIB	Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?

HARRY	Abu Kaleem Malik.

HARRY	Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
GIB	You want me to just hang-- ?
HARRY	Just hang a minute.
GIB	I'll just hang then, shall I?

HARRY	He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
GIB	Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
HARRY	She's having an affair.

GIB	Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
HARRY	It can't be.  Not Helen.
GIB	Nobody believes it can happen to them.
HARRY	It can't be.
GIB	Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
HARRY	I still don't believe it.
GIB	Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --

GIB	Is this national security stuff boring you?
HARRY	Put a tap on her phone.
GIB	What're you talking about?  We have that.
HARRY	Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.

HARRY	Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
GIB	Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

GIB	Guy's a spook!
GIB	He could be working her to get to you.

HARRY	Give me the page.
GIB	What are you talking about?
HARRY	It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
GIB	Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
HARRY	GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!

GIB	The purse is still at the house.

GIB	Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
HARRY	You tell on me, I tell on you.
GIB	Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
HARRY	What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
GIB	You know about that?

GIB	She's lying.
HARRY	You didn't have sexual relations with him?

GIB	She could be telling the truth.
HARRY	Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.

GIB	Now what?
HARRY	There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
GIB	Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
HARRY	I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.

GIB	We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
HARRY	In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.

GIB	You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.

GIB	I thought this look like your work.
HARRY	Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
GIB	You're welcome.

GIB	--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
HARRY	... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--

GIB	I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
HARRY	Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.

GIB	... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
HARRY	Here they come.

HARRY	Any minute now.

GIB	I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
HARRY	If I break it they can take it out of my pay.

GIB	He's got it.
HARRY	Sorry.

HELEN	I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
GIB	But you didn't.  Why not?
HELEN	I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.

GIB	Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
HELEN	No!  Never!
GIB	So, it was your first time.
HELEN	I wasn't cheating!

HELEN	My husband is a good man.
GIB	But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--

HELEN	Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
GIB	You're not going anywhere.

GIB	Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
JANICE	Ten, Mr. Gibson.
GIB	And you still reach for your piece every time.
JANICE	Yes sir.
GIB	God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
JANICE	Yes, sir.

HARRY	This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
JUNO	Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
HARRY	I adore it.

JUNO	Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
HARRY	I'd like that.

HARRY	Well, what's the point of waiting?
JUNO	I agree.

JUNO	So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
HARRY	That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

HARRY	Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.

HARRY	It's certainly... dramatic.
HARRY	Is that why you got into this business?

JUNO	I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
HARRY	And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.

HARRY	Yes.
JUNO	Yes what?
HARRY	Uh, yes, it is important.

JUNO	Hello, Harry.
HARRY	Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.

JUNO	This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
HARRY	Oral hygiene?
JUNO	Not exactly.

HARRY	You're damaged goods, lady.

JUNO	Did you tell her about us, Harry?
HARRY	There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
JUNO	Sure.  Say that now.

HELEN	Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
HARRY	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
HELEN	Okay.

HARRY	I'm late.
HELEN	Me too.

HELEN	How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
HARRY	Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...

HELEN	That's fabulous Harry.
HARRY	Yeah, it was wild.

HARRY	Uh huh.  Okay.
HELEN	It's not okay.  It's extortion.
HARRY	What did you tell him?
HELEN	I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
HARRY	Good thinking, honey.

HELEN	I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
HARRY	I'll handle it.

HARRY	Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.

HARRY	Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
HELEN	It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

HARRY	I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
HELEN	Yeah.  It was great.

HARRY	Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
HELEN	I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
HARRY	I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--

HARRY	It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
HELEN	What'd you do, honey?
HARRY	Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...

HARRY	...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
HELEN	It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
HARRY	Uh huh.
HELEN	My husband the hero.

HARRY	I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
HELEN	They must've just missed me.
HARRY	They said you had to run out.
HELEN	Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.

HARRY	So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
HELEN	Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.

HARRY	I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
HELEN	I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.

HARRY	How long have you been a member of his faction?
HELEN	I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.

HARRY	What did happen?
HELEN	Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.

HARRY	Why did you continue to see him?
HELEN	He needed my help.
HARRY	Not because you were attracted to him?
HELEN	No.
HARRY	You weren't attracted to him at all?
HELEN	Well, maybe a little.

HARRY	Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
HELEN	Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
HARRY	Would you say he was boring, then?
HELEN	Yeah.  I suppose he is.

HELEN	That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
HARRY	You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.

HARRY	Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
HELEN	He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
HARRY	And you agreed?
HELEN	Yes.
HARRY	Why?

HELEN	I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
HARRY	What did you need?
HELEN	I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.

HARRY	This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
HELEN	No.

HELEN	Let me out of her!  Right now!
HARRY	Answer the question--

HELEN	What?
HARRY	Do you still love your husband?
HELEN	Yes.
HARRY	Louder please.
HELEN	I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?

HELEN	Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
HARRY	Yes or no.
HELEN	What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
HARRY	You will be contacted with the assignment.
HELEN	My husband can't know about this.
HARRY	No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
HELEN	I think so.
HARRY	Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
HELEN	I can do it!
HARRY	The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
HELEN	Natasha?
HARRY	No.  Doris.

HARRY	So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
HELEN	What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

HELEN	Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
HARRY	Sure, hon.

HARRY	Now slide the nylons off one by one.
HELEN	I'm not wearing any.

HELEN	He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
HARRY	Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
HELEN	Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.

HELEN	What were you doing there?
HARRY	You wouldn't believe me.

HELEN	Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
HARRY	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
HELEN	Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?

HARRY	I'm sorry, honey.
HELEN	Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!

HELEN	What did he give you?
HARRY	Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
HELEN	It makes you tell the truth?
HARRY	Yes.
HELEN	Is it working yet?
HARRY	Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
HELEN	Are we going to die?

HARRY	17 years.
HELEN	My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
HARRY	I don't take those assignments.
HELEN	What about Juno?
HARRY	She's really a fox, isn't she?
HELEN	Did you pork her Harry?
HARRY	No.  But I wanted to.
HELEN	Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
HARRY	Looks that way.

HELEN	What is it?
HARRY	God, you have great legs.
HELEN	Harry... snap out of it!

HELEN	Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
HARRY	What?
HELEN	Do you still love me?
HARRY	Yes.
HELEN	As much as you used to?
HARRY	No.  Much more.

HELEN	If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?

HELEN	What are you going to do?
HARRY	Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.

HELEN	Oh shit.
HARRY	Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?

HELEN	... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
HARRY	I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.

HELEN	Not yet.  But we'll find him.
HARRY	Dance?

SIMON	What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
HARRY	Absolutely.

SIMON	Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
HARRY	And you've got one.
SIMON	It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
HARRY	So what's your angle?
SIMON	Sorry.  Trade secret.
HARRY	Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.

SIMON	Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
HARRY	So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
SIMON	Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
HARRY	Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
SIMON	Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
HARRY	Use 'em and lose 'em.
SIMON	Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
HARRY	What about the husbands?
HARRY	Those idiots.

HARRY	You working on someone right now?
SIMON	I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.

HARRY	What does she do?
SIMON	Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.

HARRY	But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
SIMON	Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

HARRY	Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
SIMON	Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!

SIMON	See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
HARRY	Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?

SIMON	Yeeaoowww!!
HARRY	You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
SIMON	Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--

HARRY	Beat it.
SIMON	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.

VOICE	I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
HELEN	Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
VOICE	Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
HELEN	He said he was an American agent.

HELEN	What?
VOICE	Get going! 
HELEN	Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.

VOICE	Boris and Doris?
HELEN	Go ahead.

JUNO	Who's your little friend?
HELEN	I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
JUNO	So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?

HELEN	Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
JUNO	No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
HELEN	No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--

HELEN	What's going on, Harry?
JUNO	Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.

JUNO	Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
HELEN	Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
JUNO	Hold that thought.

JUNO	Like one?
HELEN	Fuck you.

HELEN	Hello?
SIMON	Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
HELEN	Yes.  Go ahead.

HELEN	Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
SIMON	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.

SIMON	Are you sure you weren't followed?
HELEN	I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
SIMON	Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
HELEN	I understand.
SIMON	It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.



SIMON	Did you read the papers yesterday?
HELEN	Yes.

HELEN	That was you?!
SIMON	You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.

HELEN	Tell me what happened?
SIMON	I'm sorry, I can't.
HELEN	You can trust me completely.
SIMON	I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
HELEN	Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
SIMON	It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.

HELEN	And you chased one?

HELEN	What is it you want me to do?
SIMON	Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
HELEN	You'll call me then?
SIMON	Yes.  Now go.

HELEN	What's happened?

SIMON	To our assignment.
HELEN	What is it you need me to do?
SIMON	Helen, I want you to be my wife.
HELEN	I'm married!
SIMON	Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
HELEN	We're going to Paris?
SIMON	Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
HELEN	I don't know.  I have to think...
SIMON	Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.

SIMON	You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
HELEN	It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
SIMON	Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.

SIMON	Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
HELEN	Helen.
SIMON	You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
HELEN	I just glances inside.

JUNO	It's a good thing you pay me well.
MALIK	Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
JUNO	No.  He checked out okay--

JUNO	What do you want me to do?
MALIK	Find out who this Renquist it.
JUNO	How?
MALIK	Use the gifts that Allah has given you.

MALIK	Who is this woman?
JUNO	His wife.
MALIK	His wife?  Good.  Bring them.

AIRK	We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
MADMARTIGAN	He thought you were a woman, Airk!

AIRK	Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
MADMARTIGAN	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!

AIRK	I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
MADMARTIGAN	Least I'm not down there herding sheep!

MADMARTIGAN	Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
AIRK	Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
MADMARTIGAN	Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.

MADMARTIGAN	You left me to die, friend.
AIRK	You managed alright.
MADMARTIGAN	Is this what's left of your army?

AIRK	It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
MADMARTIGAN	They're not after me.  They want the baby.

AIRK	You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
MADMARTIGAN	Then come with us.

AIRK	You're chasing a dream.
MADMARTIGAN	Just get me some horses.

MADMARTIGAN	Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
AIRK	Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!

MADMARTIGAN	Thank you, friend.
AIRK	Let's go.

CHERLINDREA	Willow Ufgood.
WILLOW	Yes...?
CHERLINDREA	I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...

WILLOW	You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
CHERLINDREA	She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.

CHERLINDREA	No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
WILLOW	Me?

CHERLINDREA	You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
WILLOW	What is Tir Asleen?

CHERLINDREA	The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
WILLOW	You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
CHERLINDREA	You are very important, Willow.
WILLOW	No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

WILLOW	Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
CHERLINDREA	My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...

WILLOW	They look like acorns.
CHERLINDREA	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.

WILLOW	Sir!  I have to talk to you.
HIGH ALDWIN	Not today, Willow.
WILLOW	It's a matter of great importance to me!

HIGH ALDWIN	Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
WILLOW	My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.

HIGH ALDWIN	Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
WILLOW	If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
HIGH ALDWIN	You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
WILLOW	I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
HIGH ALDWIN	Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.

HIGH ALDWIN	Go in the direction the bird is flying.
WILLOW	Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
HIGH ALDWIN	Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...

SORSHA	You!  Are you the mother of that child?
MADMARTIGAN	No.  I mean yes.

MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
SORSHA	Let me see it.

MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
SORSHA	Why not?
MADMARTIGAN	Why not?

MADMARTIGAN	Gawd...you're...beautiful...
SORSHA	You're not a woman.

MADMARTIGAN	Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
SORSHA	My step-father's going to tear you apart.

SORSHA	I do what I'm told.
MADMARTIGAN	Too bad you're not more like your father.

SORSHA	You're a fool.  Now put her back.
MADMARTIGAN	I'm not going to let this baby die.

SORSHA	Why did you say that?
MADMARTIGAN	Say what?
SORSHA	I love you.

MADMARTIGAN	Because it's true.
SORSHA	I don't believe you.

MADMARTIGAN	Sorsha.
SORSHA	Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN	We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
SORSHA	I have no family.

MADMARTIGAN	Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
RAZIEL	He's no magician.
MADMARTIGAN	He turned that monster into stone!

MADMARTIGAN	Then you get us out of here.
RAZIEL	I will!  But I need help!

MADMARTIGAN	Who is that girl, anyway?
RAZIEL	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

MADMARTIGAN	We're a tiny version of all that?
RAZIEL	As above, so below.

RAZIEL	Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
MADMARTIGAN	Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?

MADMARTIGAN	Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
WILLOW	Good.  How long will it take?

MADMARTIGAN	Don't make me angry, Peck.
WILLOW	You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
MADMARTIGAN	Miserable Pecks.

WILLOW	Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
MADMARTIGAN	Why.
WILLOW	I have to give this baby to some- body.

WILLOW	Hey!  Somebody's coming!
MADMARTIGAN	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

MADMARTIGAN	Thanks for your help, Peck.
WILLOW	Are you okay?
MADMARTIGAN	As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
WILLOW	I don't know.

MADMARTIGAN	You a woodcutter?
WILLOW	Farmer.
MADMARTIGAN	Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.

WILLOW	You all right?
MADMARTIGAN	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

MADMARTIGAN	Smells like a battle.
WILLOW	Are you a warrior?
MADMARTIGAN	The greatest swordsman that ever lived.

WILLOW	What's that?  I hear something!
MADMARTIGAN	You hear trouble.
WILLOW	What is it?

MADMARTIGAN	I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
WILLOW	Friend of yours?

MADMARTIGAN	Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
WILLOW	I hate this.

MADMARTIGAN	Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
WILLOW	You don't know anything about ba- bies.

WILLOW	You gotta promise to feed her.
MADMARTIGAN	I will.
WILLOW	Fresh goat's milk.
MADMARTIGAN	Absolutely!

WILLOW	And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
MADMARTIGAN	Of course!  I promise!

WILLOW	Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
MADMARTIGAN	Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

WILLOW	You!!
MADMARTIGAN	Where the hell did you come from?

WILLOW	Hey!  Give me that baby!
MADMARTIGAN	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
WILLOW	Nursemaid?!

WILLOW	Time to change her diaper.
MADMARTIGAN	Time to leave.

WILLOW	Because she's sick.
MADMARTIGAN	Because she's sick.

WILLOW	Where's the baby??
MADMARTIGAN	I thought you had her!

MADMARTIGAN	Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
WILLOW	Elora Danan!

MADMARTIGAN	When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
WILLOW	Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
MADMARTIGAN	I did?

MADMARTIGAN	So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
WILLOW	Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
MADMARTIGAN	The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?

WILLOW	Madmartigan, I need your help.
MADMARTIGAN	My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.

MADMARTIGAN	I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
WILLOW	You?
MADMARTIGAN	Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.

WILLOW	I'll help you...!
MADMARTIGAN	I won't.

MADMARTIGAN	I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
WILLOW	The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN	Did she ask about me?
WILLOW	Who?
MADMARTIGAN	Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?

WILLOW	She said lots of thing.s
MADMARTIGAN	Willow!

WILLOW	She asked about you, Madmartigan.
MADMARTIGAN	Well what did she say?

MADMARTIGAN	She's in love.
WILLOW	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.

WILLOW	You?
MADMARTIGAN	What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?

WILLOW	Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
MADMARTIGAN	Want me to carry Elora?
WILLOW	I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

MADMARTIGAN	Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
WILLOW	She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
MADMARTIGAN	She's a bird, Willow.
WILLOW	That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
MADMARTIGAN	Watch it!
WILLOW	Ahhh!

WILLOW	I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
MADMARTIGAN	Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
WILLOW	I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...

MADMARTIGAN	I don't know, Willow.
WILLOW	Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?

RANON	It's not a Nelwyn baby.
WILLOW	No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...

RANON	Can't we keep it, Dada?
WILLOW	Absolutely not.

RANON	Dada, what's a daikini?
WILLOW	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
RANON	Are you scared?

RANON	I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
WILLOW	What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...

RAZIEL	Who are you!  Who are you!
WILLOW	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.

RAZIEL	What do you want!
WILLOW	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.

RAZIEL	Kill him!
WILLOW	No!
RAZIEL	Kill him!

RAZIEL	Did *you* give that acorn its power?
WILLOW	No.
RAZIEL	A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.

RAZIEL	You must learn magic.
WILLOW	That's all I ever wanted!
RAZIEL	Then I will teach you.

RAZIEL	Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
WILLOW	What do I need for that?
RAZIEL	We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.

WILLOW	I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
RAZIEL	Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
WILLOW	I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
RAZIEL	As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.

WILLOW	I'm all finished.  Now what?
RAZIEL	Burn it to a fine ash.

WILLOW	How am I gonna do that?
RAZIEL	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.

RAZIEL	We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
WILLOW	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
RAZIEL	What's the magician's weapon?
WILLOW	The limitless power of...

RAZIEL	Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
WILLOW	I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
RAZIEL	The art of transformation!

WILLOW	But what am I gonna transform??
RAZIEL	Me!

WILLOW	Oooh, this smells terrible.
RAZIEL	That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!

WILLOW	Ouch!!
RAZIEL	Shhhhh!

WILLOW	What'd you bit me for!!
RAZIEL	We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.

RAZIEL	Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
WILLOW	His will.
RAZIEL	Now use it.

WILLOW	I just wanted to test it first.
RAZIEL	No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.

RAZIEL	Tir Asleen.
WILLOW	There's nobody here.

WILLOW	How??
RAZIEL	Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

WILLOW	I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
RAZIEL	More!  More!

WILLOW	Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
RAZIEL	You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.

RAZIEL	Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
WILLOW	Why?
RAZIEL	Just do it!

WILLOW	I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
RAZIEL	No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
WILLOW	She's too powerful, Raziel

RAZIEL	Time is running out.
WILLOW	Surrender!!

RAZIEL	Patience, Willow.
WILLOW	Courage, Willow.

TEEMO	Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
ROOL	Somebody has to do it.

TEEMO	Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
ROOL	He never misses.

TEEMO	I'm not going in there.
ROOL	Me neither!

TEEMO	Are you sure?
ROOL	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!

TEEMO	We gotta follow them.
ROOL	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.

TEEMO	Get back here, Rool!
ROOL	Ouch!  Let go of me!

WILLOW	If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
SORSHA	Shut up.

WILLOW	She needs to be changed.
SORSHA	I changed her already!

WILLOW	She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
SORSHA	Who is that horrible friend of yours?
WILLOW	Madmartigan.
SORSHA	Who is he?
WILLOW	I don't know much about him.

WILLOW	She's hungry.
SORSHA	I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
WILLOW	Here.  Hold her.

TEEMO	We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
WILLOW	Queen Cherlindrea?
TEEMO	She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
WILLOW	Who??
TEEMO	You're the guardian, aren't you?

WILLOW	I'm getting her out of there!
TEEMO	No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!

WILLOW	Ohhh, I hate this.
TEEMO	Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
WILLOW	Why not?

WILLOW	This is not going well.
TEEMO	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.

TEEMO	Talk!  Say something!
WILLOW	I can't see anything--she's too bright!

TEEMO	Hey, careful there!
WILLOW	How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.

TEEMO	Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
WILLOW	How are we going to get out there?

WILLOW	We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
TEEMO	The sorceress.

TEEMO	Obviously.
WILLOW	Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.

WILLOW	This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
TEEMO	Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

CHRISTMAS	You new?
BOND	Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
CHRISTMAS	Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
BOND	Dont know any doctor jokes.

CHRISTMAS	What happened to Len Tashka?
BOND	Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
CHRISTMAS	The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.

CHRISTMAS	He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
BOND	Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.

BOND	Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
CHRISTMAS	So who are you?
BOND	Bond --

CHRISTMAS	They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
BOND	With this?

BOND	When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
CHRISTMAS	When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
BOND	Alright then, brunch.

CHRISTMAS	The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
BOND	Then its no longer a bomb?
CHRISTMAS	Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...

CHRISTMAS	What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
BOND	I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
CHRISTMAS	What the hell are you talking about?
BOND	Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
CHRISTMAS	Whos she?
BOND	Elektra King.
CHRISTMAS	Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
BOND	Makes her look even more innocent.
CHRISTMAS	What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
BOND	I was hoping you could tell me.

CHRISTMAS	What is it?
BOND	She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.

BOND	Nuclear.
CHRISTMAS	Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
BOND	Made to look just like an accident.

CHRISTMAS	But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
BOND	Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
CHRISTMAS	The King pipeline.
BOND	Elektra would control it all.

CHRISTMAS	Zukovsky...
BOND	If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.

CHRISTMAS	Is there another way?
BOND	We go down to the torpedo bay.

BOND	Hes sealed himself in.
CHRISTMAS	Hes going to insert the plutonium.

CHRISTMAS	Do you know what youre doing?
BOND	Like riding a bike.

CHRISTMAS	What kind of bikes did you ride?
BOND	Just wanted to put him on edge...

BOND	Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
CHRISTMAS	But what if...
BOND	Count to twenty.  Ill be there.

BOND	Weve got to get out.
CHRISTMAS	We cant.

BOND	I love Christmas in Turkey.
CHRISTMAS	So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?

DOCTOR GREATREX	Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
BOND	I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.

BOND	Its just a scratch.
DOCTOR GREATREX	James.  It wouldnt really be...

DOCTOR GREATREX	Then maybe Id be... open to that.
BOND	Perhaps after this ... test?
DOCTOR GREATREX	...yes?...
BOND	I could come for a second opinion?

BOND	Constructions not exactly my line.
M	Quite the opposite, in fact.

BOND	Old friend?
M	Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
BOND	Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.

M	Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
BOND	Shes not a girl anymore.

M	Ive scheduled a medical for you.
BOND	Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
M	Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.

M	007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
BOND	Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
M	And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.

M	Who told you to look at Elektras files?
BOND	I took the initiative.
M	You havent been given an assignment in this case.
BOND	I was the one who brought that money in...
M	Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
BOND	The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.

M	Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
BOND	Who?
M	Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
BOND	Renard.

M	Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
BOND	Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
M	How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.

BOND	He survived?
M	The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.

M	The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
BOND	That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
M	Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
BOND	Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.

M	Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
BOND	The worm on the hook again.

BOND	The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
M	Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
BOND	Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
M	The inside man?
BOND	Is maybe...the inside woman.

LACHAISE	Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
BOND	Which is neutral, no doubt.

LACHAISE	I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
BOND	Who did you get it from?
LACHAISE	I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
BOND	And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
LACHAISE	Your last chance. Take the money.
BOND	Your last chance. Give me the name.
LACHAISE	Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?

BOND	The name?
LACHAISE	I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!

RENARD	I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
BOND	Indeed.

BOND	Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
RENARD	Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.

BOND	Who is it?
RENARD	You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

BOND	You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
RENARD	Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
BOND	Consider me ungrateful.
RENARD	Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
BOND	Shell get over it.
RENARD	You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.

RENARD	In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
BOND	Havent you heard the news?  So is she.

WOMAN	Beautiful, isnt it?
BOND	Yes.

WOMAN	Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
BOND	Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
WOMAN	A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
BOND	You knew him well?

WOMAN	He was my father.
BOND	Im sorry.
WOMAN	He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.

ELEKTRA	I met you at my fathers funeral.
BOND	Yes.
ELEKTRA	I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
BOND	Funerals arent exactly memorable.
ELEKTRA	God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
BOND	Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
ELEKTRA	Partially, yes.

BOND	Who is he?
ELEKTRA	My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
BOND	How long has he been with you?
ELEKTRA	Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?

BOND	Does this look familiar to you?
ELEKTRA	Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.

ELEKTRA	Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
BOND	Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
ELEKTRA	If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...

BOND	The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
ELEKTRA	Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
BOND	I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
ELEKTRA	You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.

ELEKTRA	I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
BOND	Always wanted to see the upper lines.
ELEKTRA	You dont take no for an answer, do you?
BOND	No.

ELEKTRA	Oh my God...were buried alive...
BOND	Were alright.

ELEKTRA	I cant stay here.
BOND	Youre not going to.

ELEKTRA	No!  It will cave in!
BOND	Its the only way out...

BOND	I cant stay.
ELEKTRA	I know.

ELEKTRA	The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
BOND	I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.

ELEKTRA	What is it?
BOND	...you should rest.

ELEKTRA	James...
BOND	I have to go.
ELEKTRA	Then take me with you.
BOND	No. Youll be safe here.
ELEKTRA	I dont want to be safe!
BOND	I have to go to work.

ELEKTRA	Vodka martini.
BOND	Two. Shaken not stirred.

BOND	What the hell are you doing here?
ELEKTRA	Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?

BOND	If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
ELEKTRA	You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.

BOND	I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
ELEKTRA	Really?

ELEKTRA	Surely you believe in living dangerously.
BOND	Not at that price. Time to surrender.

ELEKTRA	You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
BOND	Shush.

BOND	How did you survive?
ELEKTRA	I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.

ELEKTRA	Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
BOND	A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
ELEKTRA	What are you talking about?
BOND	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
ELEKTRA	...what?
BOND	We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...

ELEKTRA	Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
BOND	You can drop the act, its over.
ELEKTRA	I dont know what youre talking about!
BOND	I think you do.

ELEKTRA	How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
BOND	He used your exact words.
ELEKTRA	You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?

BOND	Im coming with you.
ELEKTRA	You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.

ELEKTRA	I could have given you the world.
BOND	Not interested.

BOND	Wheres M?
ELEKTRA	Soon shell be everywhere.

BOND	All this, because you fell for Renard?
ELEKTRA	Five more turns and your neck will break.

ELEKTRA	Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
BOND	You turned Renard.
ELEKTRA	Just like you...only you were even easier.

BOND	So you killed your father.
ELEKTRA	He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

BOND	Was this all about the oil?
ELEKTRA	It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!

ELEKTRA	It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
BOND	No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.

ELEKTRA	Know what happens when a man is strangled?
BOND	Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.

BOND	One... last... screw?
ELEKTRA	Oh James.

BOND	Valentin Zukovsky.
ZUKOVSKY	BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
BOND	You, of course. I need some information.
ZUKOVSKY	Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
BOND	Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
ZUKOVSKY	Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.

ZUKOVSKY	See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
BOND	How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
ZUKOVSKY	What?  This is not possible.

BOND	If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
ZUKOVSKY	Where did you get this?
BOND	Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.

ZUKOVSKY	That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
BOND	How high up does this...arms dealing go?
ZUKOVSKY	Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
BOND	But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.

ZUKOVSKY	What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
BOND	Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
ZUKOVSKY	Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.

ZUKOVSKY	Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
BOND	Whats your business with Elektra King?
ZUKOVSKY	I thought you were the one in her business.
BOND	She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
ZUKOVSKY	As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.

ZUKOVSKY	That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
BOND	You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.

BOND	Now...where were we?
ZUKOVSKY	A rope!
BOND	No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?

ZUKOVSKY	Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
BOND	And the payoff on the tables?
ZUKOVSKY	A special job.  A...a...a submarine.

BOND	Wheres the sub going?!
ZUKOVSKY	No!  Get me out!
BOND	This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
ZUKOVSKY	This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!

ZUKOVSKY	So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
BOND	Where?
ZUKOVSKY	Istanbul.

ZUKOVSKY	Mother of God.
BOND	The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.

ZUKOVSKY	The Maidens Tower.
BOND	How appropriate.
ZUKOVSKY	Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.

CHRISTMAS	What?
ZUKOVSKY	To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.

ZUKOVSKY	No! Bond!
CHRISTMAS	Bond!

CHRISTMAS	What is this place?
ZUKOVSKY	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.

ZUKOVSKY	In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
CHRISTMAS	What class sub does your nephew run?
ZUKOVSKY	C-class.

M	Ill send someone out.
ELEKTRA	Could...could you come?

M	Perhaps this isnt the time...
ELEKTRA	Please.

ELEKTRA	Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
M	Your father...
ELEKTRA	Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.

ELEKTRA	Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
M	Someone will come.
ELEKTRA	Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.

ELEKTRA	Warm.
RENARD	Is it?

RENARD	So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
ELEKTRA	How would you know?

RENARD	Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
ELEKTRA	Of course...

RENARD	He was a...good lover?
ELEKTRA	What do you think?

RENARD	This is the end.
ELEKTRA	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.

ELEKTRA	Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
RENARD	Yes.  Au revoir...

M	Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
TANNER	And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

M	Do we have the range of Renards plane?
TANNER	Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
M	Marvellous.

M	The parcels in the post.
TANNER	Its heading for the oil terminal.
M	Where it can do the most damage.

M	Any word from him?
TANNER	Still no contact yet.

STORM	What does that mean?
BEAST	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.

BEAST	Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
STORM	... until he found tungsten.

BEAST	I wish I could go.
STORM	We all do.
BEAST	Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
STORM	Beast.

CYCLOPS	Can the Professor repair his own mind?
BEAST	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.

BEAST	It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
CYCLOPS	Its core?

BEAST	Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
CYCLOPS	For what purpose?
BEAST	Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
CYCLOPS	So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?

JEAN	Scott.. I -
CYCLOPS	I don't like him being here.
JEAN	What are you talking about?
CYCLOPS	You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
JEAN	If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.

CYCLOPS	What's wrong with him?
JEAN	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

JEAN	He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
CYCLOPS	We have to find Magneto.

JEAN	Are you all right?
CYCLOPS	No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.

CYCLOPS	Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
JEAN	Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
CYCLOPS	I'll tell you one thing though.
JEAN	What's that?
CYCLOPS	He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.

CYCLOPS	Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
JEAN	Into the Hudson?
CYCLOPS	Uh-huh.

CYCLOPS	I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
JEAN	It's too far.
CYCLOPS	Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.

CYCLOPS	Jean... can you?
JEAN	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.

LOGAN	Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
CYCLOPS	I wanted to talk to you.

CYCLOPS	How long have you been in Alaska?
LOGAN	I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?

LOGAN	I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
CYCLOPS	You know, you --
LOGAN	Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.

LOGAN	I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
CYCLOPS	Sure you are, sport.

JEAN	Anything else I can get you?
LOGAN	Some cigars.  Case of beer.
JEAN	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
LOGAN	I won't light the cigars - how about that?
JEAN	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
LOGAN	What if I like the pain?

JEAN	The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
LOGAN	Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
JEAN	Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
LOGAN	By reading my thoughts?
JEAN	If necessary.
LOGAN	What if they're naughty?

LOGAN	You should always work with a spotter.
JEAN	He's busy right now.

LOGAN	I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
JEAN	Were you now?
LOGAN	What do you say?
JEAN	Not interested.

JEAN	Let go.
LOGAN	Suit yourself.

LOGAN	He's uptight.
JEAN	He takes his work seriously.
LOGAN	He takes himself seriously.
JEAN	What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?

JEAN	Logan, do you see this ring?
LOGAN	I've seen a lot of rings.
JEAN	Yeah, I'll bet you have.

KELLY	You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
JEAN	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

KELLY	Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
JEAN	Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
KELLY	You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
JEAN	Control, Senator...  we teach them control.

KELLY	This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
JEAN	I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
KELLY	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.

KELLY	Dr. Grey.
JEAN	Senator?

KELLY	I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
JEAN	Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
KELLY	Tell it to the ones that did this to me.

JEAN	The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
KELLY	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.

KELLY	You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
MAGNETO	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
KELLY	You mutant bastards...

KELLY	Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
MAGNETO	Gosh, I hope so.

KELLY	The intention of registration act -
MAGNETO	INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.

KELLY	What is it you intend to do to me?
MAGNETO	Let's just say, God works too slowly.

MAGNETO	I do love a good check mate.
LOGAN	What do you want?
MAGNETO	Come with me and I'll let her live.
LOGAN	You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.

LOGAN	Where am I?
MAGNETO	You're backstage at the encore of creation.

LOGAN	What are you going to do?
MAGNETO	In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?

LOGAN	What am I doing here?
XAVIER	I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
LOGAN	Who?
XAVIER	A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.

LOGAN	Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
XAVIER	Deal.

XAVIER	The point of what?
LOGAN	This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?

XAVIER	The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
LOGAN	What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.

XAVIER	Now that's Magneto talking.
LOGAN	No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
XAVIER	I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.

LOGAN	Where are we going?
XAVIER	To find Rogue.
LOGAN	How?
XAVIER	The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.

LOGAN	You designed this yourself?
XAVIER	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
LOGAN	He helped you?
XAVIER	We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.

XAVIER	I've found her, Westchester Mall.
LOGAN	I'll go.

LOGAN	Don't you knock?
XAVIER	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
LOGAN	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.

XAVIER	Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
LOGAN	What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.

LOGAN	Why is everybody up at sunrise?
STORM	The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
LOGAN	What did she do to me?
STORM	She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
LOGAN	I felt like she almost killed me.
STORM	If she held on any longer she could have.
LOGAN	And you think it helps calling her Rogue?

SABRETOOTH	I lost him.
MAGNETO	How?
SABRETOOTH	It was Xavier's people.  They knew.

SABRETOOTH	Is that what you're looking for?
MAGNETO	A piece.  Only a piece.
SABRETOOTH	Is it enough?
MAGNETO	Enough for a test.

SABRETOOTH	I'll find him.
MAGNETO	ALIVE.

MAGNETO	I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
XAVIER	And I'll never understand terrorists.
MAGNETO	I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
XAVIER	Not at the cost of lives, Max.

MAGNETO	The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
XAVIER	What do you want with him?

XAVIER	Is that so?
MAGNETO	Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
XAVIER	You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
MAGNETO	Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.

MAGNETO	If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
XAVIER	The way what is going to be?
MAGNETO	I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
XAVIER	What do you mean to do?

MAGNETO	This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
XAVIER	WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?

MAGNETO	I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
XAVIER	I know.

MAGNETO	Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
XAVIER	It does indeed, Max.
MAGNETO	And what do you do when you wake up to that?
XAVIER	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.

BOY-PULLEN	Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
BLOOMFIELD	I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
BOY-PULLEN	From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
BLOOMFIELD	So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.

BOY-PULLEN	Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
BLOOMFIELD	Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
BOY-PULLEN	You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
BLOOMFIELD	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!

BOY-PULLEN	Why don 't the Zulus attack?
BLOOMFIELD	Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.

CHELMSFORD	An historical moment, Gentlemen.
NORRIS-NEWMAN	Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
CHELMSFORD	1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
NORRIS-NEWMAN	Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
CHELMSFORD	Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
NORRIS-NEWMAN	They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
CHELMSFORD	Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
NORRIS-NEWMAN	If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
CHELMSFORD	Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
NORRIS-NEWMAN	So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
CHELMSFORD	My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement

CHELMSFORD	What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
NORRIS-NEWMAN	Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
CHELMSFORD	Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .

CHELMSFORD	Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
DURNFORD	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
CHELMSFORD	They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD

CHELMSFORD	Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
DURNFORD	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.

CHELMSFORD	Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
DURNFORD	My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.

CHELMSFORD	You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
DURNFORD	I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
CHELMSFORD	Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust

CHELMSFORD	Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
DURNFORD	I'm explaining my reasons.

CHELMSFORD	Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
DURNFORD	And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40

CREALOCK	Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
CHELMSFORD	But will they make good use of them?

CHELMSFORD	What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
CREALOCK	Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
CHELMSFORD	Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?

CREALOCK	The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
CHELMSFORD	Thank you.

CHELMSFORD	Yes?
CREALOCK	A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.

CHELMSFORD	Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
CREALOCK	Certainly, Sin

COGHILL	Stuart?
STUART SMITH	Yes.
COGHILL	How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
STUART SMITH	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
COGHILL	Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
STUART SMITH	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.

MELVILL	Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
COGHILL	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
MELVILL	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.

COGHILL	Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
MELVILL	Which one?
COGHILL	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
MELVILL	ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
